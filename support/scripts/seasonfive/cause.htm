  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> SHAKING VIOLENTLY. PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, GEORDI,<br>
    and RO working frantically. BEVERLY and TROI standing<br>
    by. The ship is at RED ALERT -- bridge dark, except<br>
    for emergency lights. Quick action --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Damage report!</p>
  <p> Beverly works a nearby console.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Casualty reports coming in from<br>
    all over the ship...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The starboard nacelle has<br>
    sustained a direct impact. We<br>
    are venting drive plasma.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Initiating emergency core<br>
    shutdown.</p>
  <p> Geordi quickly works his console.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Inertial dampers failing... we're<br>
    losing attitude control...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> The starboard nacelle FLARES, throwing the ship into a<br>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse in a starry region of space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has entered an area<br>
    of space known as the Typhon<br>
    Expanse. We are the first<br>
    Starfleet vessel to chart this<br>
    unexplored region.</p>
  <p>7 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - POKER TABLE</p>
  <p> Poker game in progress, five card stud. Riker, Data,<br>
    Worf, Beverly. Data SHUFFLES the cards with android<br>
    speed and dexterity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Sometimes I wonder if he's<br>
    stacking the deck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assure you, Commander, the cards<br>
    have been sufficiently randomized.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I hope so.</p>
  <p> A look between Worf and Data. Data proceeds to deal<br>
    one card face-down to each person... then one card<br>
    face-up in the order of Riker, Worf, Beverly, and<br>
    himself. Data calls the cards like a true dealer,<br>
    mimicking the terms he has heard in his years of<br>
    poker...</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Because the cards will play an important role<br>
    in ensuing Acts, they are specified here.)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An eight. An Ace. A Queen. The<br>
    dealer receives a four.</p>
  <p> Everyone studies their cards.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No bet.</p>
  <p> Data deals the next round of cards face-up. Beverly is<br>
    dealt another Queen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A ten. A seven -- no help there.<br>
    A pair of &quot;ladies&quot; for the Doctor.<br>
    The dealer receives a nine.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Doctor, may I remind you that<br>
    since you show the highest hand,<br>
    you control the next bet.</p>
  <p> Beverly throws in a chip.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll bet ten.</p>
  <p> Everyone sees the bet. Data deals...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Jack. Four. Deuce. Six.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (bets)<br>
    Twenty.</p>
  <p> Data matches the bet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And I'll raise you fifty.</p>
  <p> Reactions. Worf is uncomfortable with the large bet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Fifty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will also see the bet.</p>
  <p> Worf grumbles, matches the bet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (dealing)<br>
    Seven... and a possible straight<br>
    for Commander Riker. Jack --<br>
    still no help for the Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf bristles at the remark, unhappy with his cards.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE 4A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Eight. Nine for the dealer.</p>
  <p> Beverly glances at Riker's cards... hesitant... tosses<br>
    in a few more chips.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Twenty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (folds)<br>
    &quot;Too rich for my blood.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll see your twenty -- and raise<br>
    you a hundred.</p>
  <p> Riker throws in chips. Worf reacts to the bet,<br>
    disgruntled.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Fold.</p>
  <p> Beverly studies Riker -- has a feeling here and goes<br>
    for broke... matches his bet...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And two hundred more.</p>
  <p> Riker matches.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Two. And another three hundred.</p>
  <p> A beat. Worf studies Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He does not have the straight.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Riker match poker faces.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll find out, won't we?</p>
  <p> She matches his bet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's see what you've got.</p>
  <p> The moment of truth. Riker turns over his cards,<br>
    defeated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take it.</p>
  <p> Reactions as Beverly collects her winnings. Riker's<br>
    ego has been bruised. He kicks off a playful<br>
    exchange...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    How'd you know I was bluffing?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I just had a feeling.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess it's better to be lucky<br>
    than good.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Or maybe it's the way your left<br>
    eyebrow raises slightly when you<br>
    bluff.</p>
  <p> Riker blanches -- is she kidding? Beverly smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Just teasing, Commander.</p>
  <p> NURSE OGAWA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Ogawa to Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> NURSE OGAWA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander La Forge needs you in<br>
    sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> Beverly stands to go...</p>
  <p>8 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Geordi is sitting on an examination table, while<br>
    Beverly scans him with a medical tricorder. She<br>
    centers around his ears and head...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At first I thought the catwalk<br>
    was spinning. Turns out it was<br>
    me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was<br>
    there to grab me -- it's a long<br>
    way down to the bottom of the warp<br>
    core.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to a sudden pain -- headache. Beverly<br>
    completes her exam.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have all the symptoms of an<br>
    inner-ear infection. That<br>
    would explain your dizziness...<br>
    and the headache.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She reaches for a nearby hypospray.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But I don't see any physical<br>
    evidence.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My guess is... you've been working<br>
    too hard.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods, admitting the fact.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have been putting in extra hours<br>
    on the Typhon Expanse survey.</p>
  <p> Beverly prepares the hypospray...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll give you twenty cc's of<br>
    vertazine -- it'll clear up your<br>
    dizziness. But finding time to<br>
    relax is up to you...</p>
  <p> Beverly stops in mid-sentence, caught by a sudden<br>
    awareness -- the feeling that she's done this before...<br>
    the examination... the conversation...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Geordi... have you ever had these<br>
    symptoms before?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Never.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're sure?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Positive. Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's funny... I get the feeling<br>
    that we've discussed these<br>
    complaints.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I remember giving you a hypospray<br>
    for dizziness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've never had these symptoms<br>
    before today. You must be<br>
    remembering some other patient.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I'm sure it was you.</p>
  <p> Beverly shrugs off the feeling. She administers the<br>
    hypospray.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Try to get some rest. And stay<br>
    away from high places for a few<br>
    days, just in case.</p>
  <p> Geordi stands, appreciative.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, Doc.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Goodnight.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS. Off Beverly's face, as she returns to<br>
    her work...</p>
  <p>9 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Later. Beverly is dressed in her nightclothes, ready<br>
    for bed. She passes by a table topped with several<br>
    exotic PLANTS, picks up a cutting tool and starts to<br>
    snip away the dead leaves. As she does so, she quietly<br>
    sings a little song, letting herself unwind. After a<br>
    peaceful beat, she puts down the tool, and heads for<br>
    bed...</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE ON BED</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down, reaches for a GLASS of water off the<br>
    night stand and takes a sip. She turns off the lamp<br>
    and the room darkens. She crawls under the covers,<br>
    lays her head on the pillow. A quiet moment passes<br>
    as Beverly drifts off to sleep...</p>
  <p> Then, slowly in the darkness, a barely perceptible<br>
    VOICE can be heard. A distant and echoey whisper.<br>
    Beverly opens her eyes. Listens. Gradually, a dozen<br>
    VOICES fade in -- disembodied murmurs. Creepy. She<br>
    sits up, glances around the dark and empty room...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/14/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> More voices, louder now, all meshing together. Beverly<br>
    tries to make out what they are saying -- but they are<br>
    unclear.</p>
  <p> Alarmed, Beverly turns on the light, accidentally<br>
    knocking over the glass -- the glass BREAKS on the<br>
    table, startling her.</p>
  <p> The voices stop. Beverly catches her breath, shaken...</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>12 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi, and Beverly. Geordi<br>
    is standing next to a WALL MONITOR, which displays a<br>
    MAP of the TYPHON EXPANSE. They are wrapping up a<br>
    discussion about their mission.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Typhon Expanse is huge. If<br>
    we want to chart the most remote<br>
    star system, we'll have to launch<br>
    a probe within the next few hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine.<br>
    (consults PADD)<br>
    What about the luminosity studies?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They may pose a problem...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The flux spectrometers are still<br>
    down for realignment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought they were supposed to<br>
    be back on-line yesterday.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They were, until the stellar<br>
    dynamics lab decided they needed<br>
    to install new modules.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I recommend we use the gravitron<br>
    polarimeter instead. It will<br>
    perform a similar function.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Beverly cuts in, awkward...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain... There's something I'd<br>
    like to report.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I heard... voices in my room last<br>
    night. I was alone... so at first<br>
    I thought I was imagining things.<br>
    But this morning, ten other people<br>
    reported hearing them at the same<br>
    time I did.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What were the voices saying?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I couldn't make them out...</p>
  <p> Reactions to the curious news.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, did the sensors pick up<br>
    anything unusual last night?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No anomalous readings were<br>
    reported.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When we're through here,<br>
    double-check the sensor logs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sensed nothing out of the<br>
    ordinary last night.</p>

    Maybe it's a problem with the com<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We are getting unusual readings<br>
    -- twenty thousand kilometers off<br>
    the port bow.</p>
  <p> A concerned glance, then they rise and head for the<br>
    door...</p>
  <p>13 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and the others ENTER the bridge, take stations.<br>
    Riker stands near Data, at ops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Sensors didn't detect the<br>
    phenomenon until we were almost<br>
    on top of it, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It is a highly localized<br>
    distortion in the space-time<br>
    continuum.</p>
  <p> Reactions -- they don't like the sound of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>14 INTERCUT: VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The area of space just ahead is MURKY and DISTORTED.<br>
    Reactions to the sight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Back us off, Ensign. Nice and<br>
    slow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/14/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aye sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain -- maneuvering thrusters<br>
    are not responding.</p>
  <p> On the screen, the distortion RIPPLES slightly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The distortion field is<br>

  <p> Suddenly, the bridge lights FLICKER and GO OUT. The<br>
    EMERGENCY LIGHTS come on -- and some of the consoles<br>
    LOSE POWER.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All main systems just went down.<br>
    Power levels dropping rapidly...</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has entered an area<br>

    Starfleet vessel to chart this<br>
    unexplored region.</p>
  <p>22 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - POKER TABLE</p>
  <p> (As seen in Act One.) Poker game in progress. Riker,<br>
    Data, Worf, Beverly. Data SHUFFLES the cards with<br>
    android speed and dexterity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Sometimes I wonder if he's<br>
    stacking the deck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assure you, Commander, the<br>
    cards have been sufficiently<br>
    randomized.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I hope so.</p>
  <p> A look between Worf and Data. Data proceeds to deal<br>
    one card face-down... then one card face-up to Riker,<br>
    Geordi, Beverly, and himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An eight. An Ace. A Queen. The<br>
    dealer receives a four.</p>
  <p> They study their cards.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No bet.</p>
  <p> Data deals the next round. Beverly gets another Queen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A ten. A seven -- no help there.<br>
    A pair of &quot;ladies&quot; for the<br>
    Doctor. The dealer receives a<br>
    nine.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Doctor, may I remind you that<br>
    since you show the highest hand,<br>
    you control the next bet.</p>
  <p> Beverly glances at Riker's cards... and is suddenly<br>
    struck with a vivid sense of deja-vu. The clarity of<br>
    feeling is almost uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    Is there something wrong, Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly snaps out of it.</p>

    where this game is going...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly, certain)<br>
    You're going to call my bluff,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> Beverly stares back at him, surprised. It's like a<br>
    game of dueling premonitions.</p>

    At first I thought the catwalk<br>
    was spinning. Turns out it was<br>
    me.<br>

    I'm lucky Ensign Fletcher was<br>
    there to grab me -- it's a long<br>
    way down to the bottom of the warp<br>

  <p> Geordi reacts to a sudden pain -- headache. Beverly<br>
    completes her exam.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have all the symptoms of an<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But I don't see any physical...</p>
  <p> She stops in mid-sentence, caught by a strange and<br>

    Must be deja-vu.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks troubled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Both of us -- about the same<br>
    thing?</p>
  <p> As they exchange a mystified look...</p>
  <p>25 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Later. Beverly is dressed in her nightclothes. She<br>
    passes by the table topped with exotic plants, picks up<br>
    a cutting tool, starts to trim the plants. She begins<br>
    to sing a little song, and stops -- a feeling of<br>
    deja-vu overwhelming her. She sets down the tool...<br>
    determined to break the feeling and do things<br>
    differently. She moves toward her bed...</p>
  <p>26 ANGLE ON BED</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down, picks up the glass of water and<br>
    takes a sip. She stares at the glass, deja-vu nagging<br>
    at her -- is something going to happen to the glass?<br>
    She sets down the glass, turns off the lamp, crawls<br>
    under the covers... tries to sleep...</p>
  <p> Slowly, a barely perceptible VOICE can be heard... a<br>
    distant and echoey murmur. Beverly opens her eyes.<br>
    Listens. Gradually, a dozen VOICES fade in --<br>
    disembodied murmurs in the darkness. She sits up,<br>
    glances around the dark and empty room...</p>
  <p> More voices, louder now, all meshing together.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/13/92 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly turns on the light, accidentally knocking over<br>
    the glass -- the glass BREAKS on the table, startling<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> The voices stop. Beverly catches her breath, shaken,<br>
    then gets out of bed. She picks up a nearby<br>
    communicator, taps it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Crusher to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... do you have a minute?</p>
  <p>27 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Beverly, tired after a long night, sits with Picard<br>
    in the dimly lit, comforting room. She has been<br>
    recounting recent events. Picard hands her a cup of<br>
    steaming liquid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: cup)<br>
    My Aunt Adele cured a lot of<br>
    sleepless nights with this steamed<br>
    milk.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a sip, lets it warm her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mmm... nutmeg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every time I get insomnia, I try<br>
    to perfect the recipe.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles... then collects her thoughts, getting<br>
    back to the subject at hand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It was the eeriest feeling. When<br>
    the glass broke, it triggered the<br>
    same sensation even more intensely<br>
    -- that I had done it all before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; - REV. 1/9/92 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard thinks, reaches for a table and picks up a<br>
    leather-bound BOOK.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Earlier, when I was reading this<br>
    book... I had the distinct<br>
    feeling I'd read certain<br>
    paragraphs before.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just assumed I'd read the book<br>
    years ago and forgotten.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you feel like we've had this<br>
    conversation before?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. None of this seems familiar.</p>
  <p> Picard considers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This could be nothing more than<br>
    a restless night. But let's be<br>
    sure... Call Geordi and Data.<br>
    I want you to run a shipwide<br>
    diagnostic, concentrating on the<br>
    time and place you heard the<br>
    voices.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We'll discuss the results tomorrow<br>
    at oh seven hundred hours.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods, feeling a little better. She takes a sip<br>
    of the milk.</p>

  <p> (As seen in Acts One and Two.) Poker game in progress.<br>
    Riker, Data, Worf, Beverly. Data SHUFFLES the cards<br>
    with android speed and dexterity.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Sometimes I wonder if he's<br>
    stacking the deck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assure you, Commander, the cards<br>
    have been sufficiently randomized.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I hope so.</p>
  <p> A look between Worf and Data. Data deals one card<br>
    face-down to each person. They glance at their cards.<br>
    Worf looks agitated -- he keeps glancing around the<br>
    room, bothered by a nagging feeling...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    Something wrong, Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf considers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am experiencing nIb'poH.<br>

  <p> Beverly looks disturbed by her feelings. Data and<br>
    Riker exchange a look -- both unfazed. They don't know<br>
    what to make of it. Beverly looks intently at the deck<br>
    of cards...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data.... keep dealing.</p>
  <p> Data deals the next cards face-up, calling them...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An eight. An Ace...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (cutting in)<br>
    A Queen. I'm going to get a<br>
    Queen.</p>
  <p> Data turns over the next card -- it's a Queen.<br>
    Reactions. Beverly points to Data.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And you're going to get a four...</p>
  <p> They all look at Beverly, puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deal the cards.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But nobody has bet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Forget the bet. Deal.</p>
  <p> Data deals -- the next card is indeed a four. Beverly<br>
    calls the cards a split second before they are dealt --<br>
    the cards are all exactly as she calls them...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ten... Seven... Queen...</p>
  <p> Worf cuts in, picking up the card calling...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nine... Jack... Four...</p>
  <p> Every card matches what Worf predicts. Riker takes<br>
    over, a wave of deja-vu overcoming him...</p>

  <p> Geordi has his chin in a headrest, his VISOR connected<br>
    to a diagnostic INSTRUMENT. Beverly is projecting<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His dizziness is being caused by<br>

  <p> Later. Beverly is still dressed in her uniform, too<br>
    edgy to get ready for bed. She stops at a table filled<br>
    with exotic plants, reaches for a cutting tool and...<br>
    stops. She has a flash of deja-vu -- and moves away<br>
    from the table to disrupt the feeling. She crosses<br>
    to her bed...</p>
  <p>38 ANGLE ON BED</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down, picks up the glass of water from the<br>
    night stand and takes a sip. She stares at the glass<br>
    with dread certainty -- the glass is going to break.</p>
  <p> She stands, crosses the room, sets the glass on a<br>

  <p> Softly in the darkness, a barely perceptible VOICE is<br>

  <p> Beverly sits up. Gradually, a dozen VOICES --<br>
    disembodied murmurs. Beverly turns on the lamp and<br>
    listens -- but the voices are unintelligible.<br>
    Suddenly, she gets an idea -- stands and grabs a<br>
    tricorder, hits a button and aims the tricorder into<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our theory is this -- every time<br>
    the loop begins again, everything<br>
    resets itself, and starts all<br>
    over. We don't remember anything<br>
    that happened before... so each<br>
    time through the loop, we think<br>
    it's the first.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You mean, maybe we've come into<br>
    this room, sat at this table and<br>
    had this conversation a dozen<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A dozen... a hundred... It's<br>
    impossible to tell. Maybe we've<br>

    There is evidence of some sort<br>

    Worf refers to a &quot;distortion.&quot;<br>
    If this were a temporal<br>

    Captain... We may not find out<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you suggest?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If we do find a way to avoid the<br>
    collision... we should try to<br>
    send that information into the<br>
    next loop.</p>
  <p> An intriguing notion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is that possible?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have seen that echoes, or<br>
    afterimages, from previous loops<br>
    appear as distortions in the<br>
    dekyon field. We may be able to<br>
    send a deliberate echo into the<br>
    next loop.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Like a message in a bottle...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly. We could enhance a<br>
    dekyon emission to create a<br>
    specific pattern... and send<br>
    ourselves a message. Not a long<br>
    one -- probably only a few<br>
    characters... maybe one word...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do we know we'll pick up that<br>
    word the next time through?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If the dekyon emission is<br>
    modulated correctly, it would set<br>
    up a resonance in my positronic<br>
    subprocessors. I would receive<br>
    the information -- on what you<br>
    would call a subconscious level.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain... We've been seeing the<br>
    number three all over the ship.<br>
    On consoles... in a poker game...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In total, we have encountered two<br>
    thousand eighty-five conspicuous<br>
    examples of the number &quot;three.&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All these &quot;threes&quot; can't be coming<br>
    up by accident.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe somebody's trying to tell<br>
    us something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We came to the same conclusion...<br>
    so we ran a shipwide diagnostic<br>
    -- the only unusual thing we found<br>
    was a dekyon field modulation in<br>
    Data's positronic subprocessors.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What could be causing it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know. But if I wanted<br>
    to send information from one loop<br>
    to the next... I might have used<br>
    a method like a dekyon emission.</p>
  <p> A beat as they consider.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You think we sent ourselves a<br>
    message?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It would make sense. Maybe we<br>
    were trying to tell ourselves<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>

    If that were true... what could<br>
    &quot;three&quot; indicate?</p>
  <p> They contemplate the riddle -- three... three...<br>
    three...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we should run a level three<br>
    diagnostic on all key systems.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea. And I'll have the<br>
    computer run a pattern-matching<br>
    algorithm based on the number<br>
    three.</p>

  <p> The area of space just ahead is MURKY and DISTORTED.<br>
    Picard and Riker exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you think we might've<br>
    handled this before?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks, but doesn't have an answer. He goes<br>
    with his best instincts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Back us off, Ensign. Nice and<br>
    slow.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aye sir.<br>

    Decompress the main shuttlebay<br>

    Enterprises from previous loops. Each afterimage plays<br>
    out the same fate, as they all hit the other ship and<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data -- what happened?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At the last moment, I speculated<br>
    that &quot;three&quot; might refer to the<br>
    number of rank insignia on<br>
    Commander Riker's uniform.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This indicated to me that his<br>
    suggestion was the correct course<br>
    of action.</p>
  <p> Reactions to the explanation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    You must've picked up a message<br>
    we sent from the last loop...<br>
    and stacked the deck in the poker<br>
    game without realizing it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is possible, Commander. I<br>
    may also have been inadvertently<br>
    responsible for the unexplained<br>
    appearances of the number<br>
    &quot;three.&quot;</p>
  <p> A beat as this sinks in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, end Red Alert. See<br>
    if you can access a Federation<br>
    time-base beacon. Find out how<br>
    long we've been in this causality<br>

  <p> BATESON<br>
    This is Captain Morgan Bateson of<br>
    the Federation Starship Bozeman.<br>
    Can we render assistance?</p>

  <p> BATESON<br>
    Captain Picard... your ship is<br>
    unfamiliar to us.</p>
  <p> An awkward beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you any idea what just<br>
    happened?</p>
  <p> BATESON<br>
    Our sensors detected a temporal<br>
    distortion. Then your ship<br>
    appeared... we nearly hit you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise has been caught<br>
    in temporal causality loop. And<br>
    I suspect something similar<br>
    happened to you.</p>
  <p> BATESON<br>
    You must be mistaken. We only<br>
    left starbase three weeks ago.</p>
  <p> Picard isn't sure how to put this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Bateson... do you know<br>
