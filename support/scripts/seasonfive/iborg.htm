    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Dropping out of warp speed as it enters a star system.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45854.2.<br>
    The Enterprise is charting six<br>
    star systems that make up the<br>
    Argolis cluster, an area being<br>
    considered for colonization.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, and TROI are in the command area, DATA<br>
    at ops, WORF at tactical; various SUPERNUMERARIES fill<br>
    the other posts as needed.</p>
  <p> A star fills the VIEWSCREEN -- solar flares leap out<br>
    from its surface. All watch the beautiful pyrotechnic<br>
    display except Data, who is taking sensor readings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very impressive...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's beautiful... and frightening<br>
    at the same time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reading console)<br>
    Radiation bursts from the star's<br>
    surface are making precise sensor<br>
    readings difficult. It seems to<br>
    be exhibiting gravitational<br>
    instability.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi share a smile -- Data's scientific<br>
    perspective precludes his appreciating the beauty of<br>
    what they're seeing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The star's fluctuations are too<br>
    severe. It would be impossible<br>
    to settle any of the planets<br>
    in this system.</p>
  <p> When no one acknowledges his report, he turns and looks<br>
    behind him. Everyone is watching the bursts of fire<br>
    that snake up from the star's surface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suggest we proceed to the next<br>
    system. Its sun is a stable main<br>
    sequence star.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In a moment, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data looks at their faces, then to the viewscreen.<br>
    He realizes what is going on, then returns to what he<br>
    finds more interesting: the sensor readings. After<br>
    a moment:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I am detecting a<br>
    transmission... emanating from<br>
    within this system</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What kind of signal?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is self-repeating... of unknown<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is it coming from?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A small moon orbiting the fourth<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeterminate. I am attempting<br>
    to screen out sensor<br>
    interference...<br>
    (he manipulates a few<br>
    controls)<br>
    Readings are still inconclusive;<br>
    however, the moon's atmosphere is<br>
    capable of supporting life.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then it could be a distress call.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Picard, who nods briefly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Helm, take us into transport<br>
    range.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Doctor Crusher, we need a medical<br>
    away team in transporter room two.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Riker heads for the turbolift, nodding for Worf to<br>
    follow.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. THE CRASH SITE - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PAN ACROSS a snowy, frozen landscape to take in the<br>
    scattered wreckage of a crashed spacecraft -- charred<br>
    metal and ship's innards litter the area. The AWAY<br>
    TEAM (BEVERLY, Riker, Worf) MATERIALIZES in the<br>
    foreground. Beverly scans with her medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm reading one life form... very<br>
    weak signs.</p>
  <p> She follows her readings toward the heart of the<br>
    wreckage.</p>
  <p>4 CLOSE - BEVERLY</p>
  <p> she sees something...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 WIDEN</p>
  <p> to reveal a person's legs emerging out from under some<br>
    debris. She gestures for Riker and Worf to help her<br>
    and they lift it off.</p>
  <p>6 ANGLE - BEVERLY, RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> as they see the survivor's face for the first time.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE - THE SURVIVOR</p>
  <p> We understand why they reacted as they did -- the<br>
    survivor is a Borg...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>8 EXT. THE CRASH SITE -- MOMENTS LATER</p>
  <p> Beverly is scanning the survivor's still form; she<br>
    checks a reading and administers the appropriate hypo.<br>
    The Borg is an adolescent male -- one of his arms is a<br>
    mechanical prosthetic, as is one of his eyes. Riker<br>
    stands, his face is troubled. Worf has already drawn<br>
    his phaser; Riker raises a hand that it's all right,<br>
    then keys his combadge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've found the wreckage of a<br>
    small craft... and one survivor.</p>
  <p>9 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's a Borg.</p>
  <p> Picard's features seem to darken.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Male, adolescent -- he's badly<br>
    hurt.</p>
  <p> When Picard says nothing:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no indication of other<br>
    Borg activity within sensor range.</p>
  <p> Picard betrays no sign of having heard him; he is<br>
    weighing the options. After a moment:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Away team, prepare to return to<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. THE CRASH SITE</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly react.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We can't leave him here, he won't<br>
    survive.</p>
  <p> When Picard doesn't answer, Riker steps in:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think the captain understands<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then I don't.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Borg usually collect their<br>
    dead --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's not dead --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And that transmission --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    -- at least not yet --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That transmission we intercepted<br>
    was probably a homing signal.<br>
    We have to assume they're on their<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (acknowledging this)<br>
    At least let me stabilize his<br>
    condition, give him a chance of<br>
    surviving until they get here.</p>
  <p> Riker can't ignore this plea.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p>11 INT. BRIDGE - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your concern is noted, Doctor.<br>
    But any intervention on your part<br>
    would only alert the Borg to our<br>
    having been here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. CRASH SITE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Throughout this exchange, Beverly has never stopped<br>
    treating the Borg.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid we've already turned<br>
    that corner.</p>
  <p> She passes a wound-sealer (OPTICAL) over the Borg's<br>
    forehead as she says this, closing a nasty gash and<br>
    stopping the bloodflow.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kill it. Now. We could make it<br>
    appear that it died in the crash<br>
    -- leave no evidence that we were<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Worf's solution is harsh, but it has the virtue of<br>
    showing what's at stake here. Without waiting for<br>
    a reply, he moves off to investigate the surroundings.<br>
    Riker waits for the captain's reaction.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't like either of his options.<br>
    Reluctantly, he chooses to allow Beverly to continue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Security measures must be taken<br>
    before we beam it on board.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. CRASH SITE</p>
  <p> Relieved, Beverly smiles, and continues her<br>
    ministrations.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Standing by...</p>
  <p>15 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, notify security to<br>
    prepare a detention cell.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to engineering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're bringing a Borg survivor<br>
    on board. We'll need to<br>
    neutralize the homing signal --</p>
  <p>16 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI at a science station.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continued)<br>
    -- prevent it from sending or<br>
    receiving transmissions of any<br>
    kind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll set up a subspace damping<br>
    field around the detention cell.</p>
  <p>17 EXT. CRASH SITE -- A FEW MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Worf has discovered several other dead Borg scattered<br>
    among the shuttle debris. He returns to Riker and<br>
    Beverly, who is still treating the injured Borg.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There are four others. None<br>
    survived.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Picard to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Go ahead, Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're transporting you directly<br>
    to the detention cell.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I need him in sickbay --</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    The cell, Doctor. Whatever<br>
    equipment you need will be brought<br>
    to you there.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't like it -- but backs down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p>17A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> There is a moment as Picard accepts this; then, without<br>
    a word, he stands and EXITS to his ready room. Troi<br>
    looks after him for a beat, then rises.</p>
  <p>17B INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is rounding his desk as the door CHIMES. He<br>
    stops, glances toward it, seems mildly irritated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Troi comes in. Picard continues on<br>
    to his chair and busies himself with his monitor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... I just wondered if<br>
    there's anything you wanted to<br>
    talk about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think so, Counselor.</p>
  <p> A brief pause as he continues to fiddle with his<br>
    monitor. Troi understands this man well... how<br>
    difficult it is for him to acknowledge weakness.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I would have thought that<br>
    having a Borg on the ship would<br>
    stir some feelings...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am quite recovered from my<br>
    experience, thank you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sometimes... even when a victim<br>
    has dealt with his assault...<br>
    there are residual effects of the<br>
    event that linger. You were<br>
    treated violently by the Borg...<br>
    kidnapped, assaulted, mutilated<br>
    --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor --</p>
  <p> Hearing his own somewhat sharp tone, he checks himself,<br>
    sees Troi looking at him imperturbably.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, I very much appreciate<br>
    your concern for me. But I assure<br>
    you, it is misplaced.</p>
  <p> He glances at Troi, still watching him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have carefully considered the<br>
    implications of having this Borg<br>
    on the ship. I have weighed the<br>
    possible risks, and I am convinced<br>
    we've done the right thing.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am quite comfortable with my<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> He is, of course, avoiding how he feels about the Borg<br>
    -- an omission of which Troi is quite aware.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see. Well, if at any point you<br>
    want to talk more...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will certainly avail myself of<br>
    your help.</p>
  <p> But he has shut her out. She EXITS, sensing that the<br>
    captain has some rough times ahead.</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the moon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/09/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>19 INT. THE DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard approaches Geordi, Worf, and two SECURITY<br>
    PERSONNEL who stand outside the force field. A NURSE<br>
    is just entering the cell.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Security Guard)<br>
    Lower the force field.</p>
  <p> The force field briefly flares to let her through, then<br>
    is reinstated. Beverly is already inside, working on<br>
    the Borg. As Picard approaches, Worf addresses him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the Borg is still<br>
    unconscious.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks up at Picard. His face shows nothing of<br>
    what he might be feeling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He suffered massive internal<br>
    injuries. We've got the<br>
    hemorrhaging under control, but<br>
    some of the implants in his brain<br>
    were damaged. I may have to<br>
    remove them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Borg will die if they're<br>
    removed permanently. Their brains<br>
    grow dependent on the biochips.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps Geordi could construct<br>
    new implants...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They contain relatively<br>
    straightforward programming,<br>
    interface protocols... we have<br>
    the files we downloaded after your<br>
    experience, sir. I think I could<br>
    manage it.</p>
  <p> Picard muses for a moment... turning something over<br>
    in his mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge... do you have<br>
    enought knowledge of Borg<br>
    programming to alter the pathways<br>
    to the root command structure?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT ONE 12-13. </p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure, sir. The<br>
    subroutines are pretty<br>
    complicated... I'd probably have<br>
    to study their data processing<br>
    algorithms... that's the only way<br>
    I could trace the access codes.</p>
  <p> Picard turns, looks for a moment at the<br>
    still-unconscious Borg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we could get to the root<br>
    command... we could introduce an<br>
    invasive programming sequence<br>
    through its biochip system...<br>
    and then return it to the hive.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (getting it)<br>
    The Borg are so interconnected<br>
    it would spread like a virus.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until it infected the entire<br>
    Collective. We could disable<br>
    their neural network in one<br>
    stroke.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Infected... it sounds like you're<br>
    talking about a disease.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite right, Doctor. And if all<br>
    goes well, a terminal one.</p>
  <p> Picard's demeanor is icy; Geordi, Beverly and Worf<br>
    have mixed reactions as:</p>
  <p>20<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    21<br>
    FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>22 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Beverly, and Troi; Picard and Geordi have<br>
    just finished explaining their plan. Of the group,<br>
    Beverly has the most troubled response.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If this works the way I think it<br>
    will, once the invasive program<br>
    starts spreading, it'll only be<br>
    a matter of months before the Borg<br>
    suffer total systems failure.</p>
  <p> There is a silence at this. Picard looks around the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Comments.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A question. What, exactly, is<br>
    &quot;total systems failure?&quot;</p>
  <p> Data doesn't recognize the sarcasm in her voice, and<br>
    so answers her straight.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Borg are extremely<br>
    computer-dependent. A total<br>
    systems failure will destroy<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I just think we should be plain<br>
    about that. We're talking about<br>
    annihilating an entire race...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which under most circumstances<br>
    would be unconscionable. But as<br>
    I see it, the Borg leave us little<br>
    choice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I agree. We're at war.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's been no formal declaration<br>
    of war...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not from our side. But certainly<br>
    from theirs. They've attacked<br>
    us in every encounter we've had.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They have declared war on our way<br>
    of life. We are to be<br>
    assimilated.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Even in war, there are rules.<br>
    You don't kill civilians<br>
    indiscriminately.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There are no civilians among the<br>
    Borg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Think of them as a single,<br>
    collective being. Any one Borg<br>
    is no more an individual than your<br>
    arm or your leg.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How convenient.</p>
  <p> Picard fastens his eyes on her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your point?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    When I look at my patient, I don't<br>
    see a collective consciousness...<br>
    I don't see a hive... I see a<br>
    living, breathing boy... who's<br>
    been hurt and who needs help.<br>
    And we're talking about sending<br>
    him back to his people as an<br>
    instrument of destruction.</p>
  <p> Picard turns from her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It comes down to this: We are<br>
    faced with an enemy that is<br>
    determined to destroy us, and with<br>
    whom we have no hope of<br>
    negotiating peace. Unless that<br>
    changes, we are justified in doing<br>
    anything we can to survive.</p>
  <p> SECURITY GUARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Security to Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard, here.</p>
  <p> SECURITY GUARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    The Borg has regained<br>
    consciousness, sir.</p>
  <p> Reactions...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (stands)<br>
    We will proceed as planned.</p>
  <p>23 INT. DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Borg is moving along the perimeter of the detention<br>
    cell's wall, feeling his way, looking up and down as he<br>
    covers every square inch of the wall. He is a young<br>
    man of about eighteen, and though possessing the<br>
    intimidating Borg characteristics -- prosthetic arm,<br>
    eye, etc. -- he nonetheless exudes the vulnerability of<br>
    youth. A portable SENSOR device is visible in the<br>
    cell. As he encounters the force field, he reacts,<br>
    stepping back and proceeding with his careful<br>
    exploration of the walls.</p>
  <p>24 ON THE GROUP</p>
  <p> outside the force field: Picard, Geordi, Beverly, and<br>
    the security team.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's he doing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Trying to find an access terminal,<br>
    so he can interface with the<br>
    collective. He doesn't understand<br>
    that the signal has been cut off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reading the sensor)<br>
    He's emitting a homing signal...<br>
    and a second subspace frequency...<br>
    but our damping field is blocking<br>
    both signals.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's alone. For the first time<br>
    in his life he's being forced to<br>
    cope with his environment without<br>
    the resources of the Collective.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at the boy groping the wall.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He must be hungry.</p>
  <p> They look at her curiously.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Borg don't ingest food --<br>
    their implants can synthesize any<br>
    organic molecules their biological<br>
    tissues require. What they need<br>
    -- is energy.</p>
  <p> She looks right at Picard, a bit challenging. Picard<br>
    addresses Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Arrange to feed it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard gives the Borg a last look before he EXITS.<br>
    Beverly and Geordi watch as the Borg continues his<br>
    slow, painstaking groping around the cell, looking for<br>
    something familiar.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll have to adapt a power conduit<br>
    and install it in there.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't respond, and he looks at her.<br>
    Beverly's eyes are fixed on the Borg.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If I didn't know better... I'd<br>
    think he was scared.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and eyes the Borg, who is feeling<br>
    carefully, high on the wall, for a link-up with home.</p>
  <p>25 INT. SHIP'S GYMNASIUM</p>
  <p> Two figures are fencing. It soon becomes clear that<br>
    one of them is less adept than the other. He or she is<br>
    forced to retreat just to stay in the match -- but<br>
    retreat only delays the inevitable. The better fencer<br>
    lunges and makes a touch.</p>
  <p> The two remove their masks and we realize that Picard<br>
    is the better fencer; his opponent -- is GUINAN.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I don't think I like this sport.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Last week when you scored two<br>
    touches on me, you liked it well<br>
    enough.</p>
  <p> They start walking toward the side of the room, where<br>
    &quot;gym bags&quot; lie on a bench.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Today your foil was dipping too<br>
    low... you kept letting me inside.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    And if I hold it too high, you<br>
    lunge under it. Let's face it<br>
    -- you're just better at this than<br>
    I am.</p>
  <p> They reach the bench, sit, pull out towels, wipe their<br>
    faces, taking a breather between encounters. There is<br>
    a silence, somewhat prolonged, as they do what they do,<br>
    and when Guinan finally speaks, it is with forced<br>
    nonchalance.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I hear we have a guest on board.</p>
  <p> Picard shoots her a glance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Another silence.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Is that wise?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure. I hope so.</p>
  <p> Another pause as Guinan stuffs things in her bag.<br>
    There's a lot going on inside, but she's keeping a lid<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I thought I understood you,<br>
    Picard. But I don't understand<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was an errand of mercy... he<br>
    was injured, Doctor Crusher<br>
    decided for humanitarian reasons<br>
    to care for him --</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    They'll be coming, you know that.<br>
    You, of all people, know that.</p>
  <p> Picard knows she's right. He has no answers. He<br>
    changes tacks, rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shall we go again?</p>
  <p> She nods, and they don their masks and go to center<br>
    floor. They advance and retreat a few times, parrying.<br>
    Then Guinan lunges... stumbles... grabs at her leg<br>
    -- she's pulled a muscle.</p>
  <p> Picard drops his foil and starts toward her in concern.<br>
    Suddenly she is up and on him in a flurry of thrusts,<br>
    and actually knocks the foil from his hand. She takes<br>
    off her mask.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You felt sorry for me. Look what<br>
    it got you.</p>
  <p> And she holds his look, defiant -- and unquestionably<br>
    angry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>26 INT. DETENTION CELL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf ENTER and cross toward the two Guards,<br>
    who stand to either side of the Borg's cell; Geordi<br>
    is carrying the power conduit he has constructed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll have to go in... to connect<br>
    the power conduit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Security Guard)<br>
    I will follow the Commander.<br>
    Reactivate the field once we're<br>
    through.</p>
  <p> Both guards hold their phasers ready. Worf nods to<br>
    the Guard, who drops the force field. Geordi and<br>
    Worf step forward, moving slowly so as not to startle<br>
    the Borg, who is huddled in a corner.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good, now just stay there.</p>
  <p> The Borg looks at them; an attachment on his prosthetic<br>
    arm makes a mechanical sound as it spins, adding<br>
    tension to the moment.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves toward the cell wall where he opens a<br>
    panel and exposes a power terminal. Worf stations<br>
    himself just inside the force field.</p>
  <p> Geordi begins installing the conduit. The Borg takes a<br>
    step toward him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> The Borg stops after one step. His voice has none of<br>
    the metallic edge we've heard from the Borg before.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We are Borg.</p>
  <p> Geordi ignores him, he has a pretty good idea of what's<br>
    coming next:</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You will be assimilated.</p>
  <p> Though annoyed, Geordi continues to ignore him.</p>

    Take a look around, pal, you're<br>
    not exactly in a position to make<br>
    demands.</p>
  <p> The Borg accesses his biochips for instructions.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We must return to the Collective.</p>
  <p> Geordi stops and looks at him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who's &quot;we?&quot;</p>
  <p> The Borg seems to consider the question.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We... are Borg.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's only one of you.</p>
  <p> The Borg doesn't reply.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Do you have a name?</p>
  <p> The Borg doesn't understand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A means of identification?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Third, of five.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (figuring it out)<br>
    There were five on your ship...<br>
    Is that it? Just a number?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Third, of five.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It does kind of suit you.</p>
  <p> He finishes installing the power conduit.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is for you. It regulates<br>
    the power flow to the frequency<br>
    you're used to...<br>
    (indicating)<br>
    ... and this connection should fit<br>
    the coupling on your arm.</p>
  <p> When no reply is forthcoming.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're welcome.</p>
  <p> He gathers his tools and moves toward the force field.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's get out of here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Lower the force field.</p>
  <p> The Security Guard lowers the field, then reactivates<br>
    it when Geordi and Worf step through. They turn to<br>
    watch the Borg, who moves toward the conduit. He seems<br>
    suspicious of Geordi's motives, but after a brief<br>
    deliberation, decides to plug in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's hungry all right.</p>
  <p> No optical effect should be necessary to convey the<br>
    sense that power is flowing into his depleted system<br>
    -- his carriage will indicate that he is being<br>
    replenished. He turns and fastens his orb on the two<br>
    of them.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why do you do this?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm just a nice guy at heart.<br>
    Feeling better?</p>
  <p> The Borg stares at him.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You are not-Borg.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's right. And hope to stay<br>
    that way.</p>
  <p> The Borg looks at his arm, attached to the power<br>
    conduit, then back at Geordi and Worf. He seems<br>
    perplexed. He is truly adrift, alone in a world he<br>
    cannot understand. He falls back on basic Borg:</p>

  <p>27 INT. SCIENCE LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi with Beverly, making plans to transport the<br>
    Borg. Geordi has hooked up a power conduit similar<br>
    to the one Geordi set up in the detention cell. There<br>
    are consoles, monitors, equipment, etc.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've been rationing his portions<br>
    of energy. I think he<br>
    understands -- if he cooperates,<br>
    he gets fed. If not...<br>
    (shrugs)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Like a rat in a cage.</p>
  <p> Geordi gives her a look; he knows she's less than<br>
    enthusiastic about this plan. He tries to explain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If I'm gonna figure out his<br>
    command pathways, I have to learn<br>
    how he processes information.<br>
    The only way I know to do that<br>
    is to give him perceptual tests.<br>
    That means getting his<br>
    cooperation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So he can participate in the<br>
    destruction of his entire species.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm here to help you... but I<br>
    don't have to like it.</p>
  <p> Geordi decides to leave it at that. He surveys the<br>
    room, satisfied that they're ready.</p>

  <p> The Borg and an N.D. Security Guard MATERIALIZE in<br>
    the lab. The boy looks disoriented, uncertain of his<br>
    surroundings. He looks around the room for anything<br>
    familiar... and spots the power conduit. He lifts his<br>
    prosthetic arm toward it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You want some?</p>
  <p> The Borg turns and looks at him. He nods. Geordi<br>
    moves to the conduit and gestures to the Borg to hook<br>
    on. He does. Worf retreats to the door.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor Crusher, this is Third of<br>
    Five. Third of Five, this is our<br>
    ship's doctor.</p>
  <p> The Borg looks puzzled. He stares at Beverly; what<br>
    she sees is a boy, almost the age of her son, who is<br>
    lost in a strange world.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (warmly)<br>

    That didn't happen to you. When<br>

  <p> The Borg stares at her, trying to understand this.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's my duty. To help those<br>
    who are hurt.</p>
  <p> The Borg frowns, trying to understand. He looks at<br>
    his arm, drawing energy from the conduit, and then<br>
    looks up at Geordi.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You give us food...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Is that your duty?</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah. That's right.</p>
  <p> He turns away to a console, begins entering<br>
    instructions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Listen, Third of Five... Doctor<br>

    of the damage to your biochip<br>

  <p> The Borg looks from one to the other, confused and<br>
    uncertain, but without guile. He is an innocent, and<br>
    it is this quality more than any other that will come<br>
    to play on the Enterprise crew.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Terrific. Okay, Third of Five,<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now imagine what this shape would<br>
    look like if it were turned inside<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> She changes the display to show three choices; all are<br>
    quite complex and not very obviously different from<br>
    each other.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Which one is it?</p>
  <p> Geordi's face shows that even he's not sure which one<br>
    it is.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    This one.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's right.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    He's gotten every one -- eight<br>
    for eight. That blows the top<br>
    right off the spatial acuity<br>
    percentiles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's the prosthetic eye... it<br>
    seems to be giving him very<br>
    complex visual information...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Like some kind of holographic<br>
    imaging system.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That could be helpful.</p>
  <p> He turns to the Borg, who has been following this<br>
    interchange with some fascination.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hugh, I'd like to take a closer<br>
    look at your eyepiece. Is that<br>
    okay?</p>
  <p> To Geordi's surprise, Hugh reaches up and with one<br>
    quick motion, removes his eyepiece.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... thanks.</p>
  <p> He takes the eyepiece and begins inspecting it. During<br>
    the next, he studies the device, but keeps getting<br>
    drawn to the conversation between the Borg and Beverly.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    When you are assimilated, you will<br>
    have a similar device.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hugh, do you understand that we<br>
    don't want to be assimilated?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why do you resist us?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Because... we don't want to live<br>
    the way you do.</p>
  <p> The Borg seems to puzzle over this.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Here it is quiet. There are no<br>
    other voices.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Other voices?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    On a Borg ship we live with the<br>
    thoughts of the others in our<br>
    minds. Thousands of voices...<br>
    with us always.</p>
  <p> Beverly is touched by this spontaneous outpouring of<br>
    the pleasures of Borg life. She realizes once more<br>
    how alien it must be for him here.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think what you're saying... is<br>
    that you're lonely.</p>
  <p> The Borg frowns, not exactly understanding the concept.<br>
    Geordi gives him back the eyepiece.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Here you go.</p>
  <p> The Borg reinserts the eyepiece, then studies the two<br>
    of them.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    When you have completed these<br>
    tests, what will be done with us?</p>
  <p> It is an innocent question, devoid of guile. Geordi<br>
    feels a bit uncomfortable, falls back on a partial<br>
    truth.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll send you home.</p>
  <p> Hugh nods at this, seeming almost buoyed.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We will rejoin the Collective.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Beverly exchange a glance... Geordi seems<br>
    almost as troubled as Beverly about what they're doing.</p>
  <p>30 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Geordi at the bar; Guinan listening.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's funny... when I first started<br>
    out, I had no problem with<br>
    creating this invasive program...<br>
    but the more I work with Hugh,<br>
    the more I --</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Hugh?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's the name we gave him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You named a Borg...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah.<br>
    (a little defensive)<br>
    It was easier to have something<br>
    to call him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Okay, so now you have a Borg named<br>
    Hugh...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And... he's not anything like I'd<br>
    expected.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know... he's... he just<br>
    seems like a kid.. a long way from<br>
    home...</p>
  <p> Guinan eyes him skeptically.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You're the second person today<br>
    that's talked about this Borg as<br>
    if he were a lost child...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And now I'm having second thoughts<br>
    about what we're doing.<br>
    Programming him like a walking<br>
    bomb... sending him back to<br>
    destroy the others...</p>
  <p> Guinan leans down to him. Again, the strain of anger<br>
    wells up in her, and she speaks with intensity.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    This &quot;kid's&quot; big brothers are<br>
    going to hunt us down. They won't<br>
    rest until they have him back.<br>
    And they'll destroy us in the<br>
    process -- without any of this<br>
    soul-searching you're going<br>
    through.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe you should go talk to him.<br>
    It might not seem so clear cut<br>
    then.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I wouldn't have anything to say.</p>
  <p> Geordi swings off the stool.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then why don't you just listen?<br>
    That's what you do best, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> And he's gone, leaving Guinan with a welter of<br>
    feelings.</p>

    Riker is standing, looking over his shoulder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've picked up a vessel on long<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Borg...</p>

  <p> When Picard says nothing:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interference from the star's<br>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 INT. DETENTION CELL</p>
  <p> Guinan ENTERS and crosses toward the cell where the<br>
    Borg is being held. She and the security guards<br>
    exchange a nod.</p>
  <p>35 CLOSE - GUINAN</p>
  <p> as she sees the Borg for the first time. Myriad<br>
    feelings rise in her.</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE - BORG</p>
  <p> as he sees her. He moves forward in a curious,<br>
    friendly way. They stare at each other for a moment.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Well... you don't look so tough.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    (a bit puzzled)<br>
    We are Borg.</p>
  <p> A silence as she inspects him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I hear they gave you a name.</p>
  <p> A little flicker of -- pride? -- from the Borg, who<br>
    nods.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Yes. We are Hugh.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, a bit challenging, as though waiting<br>
    for him to speak.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Well? Aren't you going to tell<br>
    me I have to be assimilated?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You wish to be assimilated... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, I don't wish. But that's what<br>
    you people do.</p>
  <p> The Borg nods. He's getting a real strong message<br>
    about how people don't want to become part of the<br>
    collective.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Resistance is futile. Right?</p>
  <p> Hugh repeats the litany, but it sounds halting and<br>
    tentative.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Resistance is futile...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I've got news for you. It isn't.<br>
    Some of my ancestors resisted the<br>
    Borg, when you came to assimilate<br>
    us. A few escaped.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Resistance is not futile...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> She looks at him, caught off guard a moment by his<br>
    admission, but still needing to vent her pain.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But thanks to you, there aren't<br>
    many of us. We're scattered<br>
    around the galaxy... we have no<br>
    home... we don't even have each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> The Borg takes this in, considers, is reminded of<br>
    something he recently heard.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    What you are saying... is that<br>
    you are lonely.</p>
  <p> Guinan stares at him, not believing what she's heard.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You have no others. You have no<br>
    home.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/06/93 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Guinan is taken aback. The Borg stares at her, touches<br>
    his chest.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We are also lonely.</p>
  <p> And she has no answer.</p>
  <p>37 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the moon.</p>
  <p>38 INT. SCIENCE LAB</p>
  <p> Geordi is with the Borg. Worf is not present -- they<br>
    are alone, attesting to the comfort Geordi is feeling<br>
    about Hugh's presence. Geordi is working with the<br>
    prosthetic armpiece while Hugh watches with interest.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    What is Geordi doing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just studying the components in<br>
    your prosthesis.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Geordi glances at him. He's more and more<br>
    uncomfortable with the task he's been assigned.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're just trying to learn more<br>
    about you.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Hugh is as persistent as a four-year-old who's learned<br>
    the word &quot;why?&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're very different from us.<br>
    Part of what we do is to learn<br>
    more about other species.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We assimilate species. Then we<br>
    know everything about them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah. I know.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Is that not easier?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe it is. It's just not what<br>
    we do.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Geordi sighs, puts the armpiece down. He struggles<br>
    for a way to explain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Think about it this way. Every<br>
    time you talk about yourself, you<br>
    use the word &quot;we.&quot; We do this,<br>
    we do that... you don't know how<br>
    to think of yourself as a single<br>
    individual. You don't say, &quot;I<br>
    want this,&quot; or &quot;I am Hugh.&quot;</p>
  <p> The Borg stares at him, trying to follow.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We are all separate individuals.<br>
    I am Geordi. I choose what I want<br>
    to do with my life. I make<br>
    decisions for myself. For people<br>
    like me, losing that individuality<br>
    -- is almost worse than dying.</p>
  <p> There is a silence. Hugh ponders this.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    When you sleep... there are no<br>
    voices in your mind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Are you ever...<br>
    (testing the new word)<br>
    ... lonely?</p>
  <p> A bit of a smile from Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sometimes. But that's why we have<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Friends...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure. Someone you talk to...<br>
    who can be with you when you're<br>
    lonely... who makes you feel<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> What is almost a smile passes over Hugh. With utter<br>
    simplicity, he gazes at Geordi, understanding the<br>
    concept fully.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Like Geordi... and Hugh.</p>
  <p> Geordi stares at him. Stricken.</p>
  <p>39 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are showing Picard the programming<br>
    anomaly they've designed. A topographical map of a<br>
    complex geometric shape is displayed on the wall<br>
    monitor. There is something odd about it, like an M.C.<br>
    Escher drawing, where perspective is played with.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's it, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It looks harmless enough.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We had to disguise it as something<br>
    innocuous. The Borg have ways<br>
    of screening out programming<br>
    anomalies.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard studies the strange form on the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can a geometric form<br>
    disable a computer system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The shape is a paradox. It cannot<br>
    exist in real space or time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When Hugh's imaging apparatus<br>
    imprints it on his bio-chips,<br>
    he'll try to analyze it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He will be unsuccessful, and will<br>
    store the shape in his memory<br>
    banks. It will be shunted to a<br>
    subroutine for further analysis.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When the Borg download his memory,<br>
    they'll incorporate it into their<br>
    network. Then they'll try to<br>
    analyze it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is designed so that each<br>
    approach they take will spawn an<br>
    anomalous solution. The anomalies<br>
    are designed to interact with each<br>
    other, linking together to form<br>
    an endless and unsolvable puzzle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite original. How long before<br>
    total systems failure?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not until the shape has gone<br>
    through several hundred<br>
    computational cycles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When can you begin the process?</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Another twenty hours. Doctor<br>
    Crusher wants to make sure the<br>
    new implants have taken hold.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Proceed as soon as<br>
    you're ready.</p>
  <p> He turns to walk away, but Geordi follows.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard turns back.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have to admit... I've been<br>
    having second thoughts about this<br>
    plan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For what reason?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... I've been getting to know<br>
    him. The Borg.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> Geordi is uncomfortable under his gaze. He feels the<br>
    need to explain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's not what I thought he would<br>
    be, sir. He has feelings... he's<br>
    homesick...<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    I don't know... it just seems<br>
    wrong to use him like this.</p>
  <p> There is a cold silence. Picard doesn't particularly<br>
    want to think about this issue; he'd rather keep his<br>
    emotional distance. He tries to find a way to help<br>
    Geordi keep his.</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Centuries ago, when laboratory<br>
    animals were used for research...<br>
    scientists would occasionally<br>
    become attached to the creatures.<br>
    That was a problem if the<br>
    experiment involved killing them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I would suggest you unattach<br>
    yourself from the Borg, Mister<br>
    La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    Aye, Captain.</p>
  <p> And Picard EXITS, leaving Geordi behind, still<br>
    troubled.</p>
  <p>40 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard is ready for bed, carrying a cup of tea and a<br>
    book toward the bedroom. The door CHIME sounds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens and there stands Guinan. Surprised,<br>
    Picard gestures her in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guinan... please, come in.</p>
  <p> She does. She seems a little uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You sure? Looks like you're all<br>
    set for a quiet evening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm delighted to see you. Would<br>
    you like something to drink?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, thanks.</p>
  <p> She wanders the room a bit, picking up an artifact and<br>
    setting it down, gazing out the window.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard waits patiently, knowing she'll get to whatever<br>
    brought her here in her own time.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I was thinking about how you said<br>
    my foil was dipping the other<br>
    day... maybe I should do some<br>
    exercises... build up a little<br>
    strength in my arm...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A strong forearm is always an<br>
    advantage in fencing...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Not to mention tending bar...</p>
  <p> He waits. She goes to a chair, sits.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    About the Borg...</p>
  <p> Now it's his turn to be wary. What could she have in<br>
    mind about the Borg to bring her here at this hour?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Aren't you just a bit surprised<br>
    by him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surprised...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes. Did you know he has a name?</p>
  <p> Picard gives her a look -- surprised.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    La Forge gave it to him. His<br>
    name's Hugh. And he's lonely.</p>
  <p> Picard is utterly perplexed, both by what she's saying<br>
    and the fact that it's Guinan saying it.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I don't know what made me go see<br>
    him. La Forge told me I should,<br>
    but I said no.</p>
  <p> She shakes her head, perplexed by herself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    And then... I found myself<br>
    standing there, staring at him.<br>
    Curiosity, I figured... just<br>
    curiosity.</p>
  <p> She breaks off, struggling in a way we haven't seen<br>
    Guinan struggle before.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Picard... I want to hear you say<br>
    that you're sure -- that what<br>
    you're doing is right.</p>
  <p> Picard exhales. The last thing he wants is another<br>
    assault on his decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you've come here to persuade<br>
    me not to use the invasive<br>
    program...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No -- I think I'm asking you to<br>
    persuade me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Two days ago, you were so upset<br>
    about the Borg even being on the<br>
    ship that you tore the foil out<br>
    of my hand. Now you're here<br>
    questioning whether he should be<br>
    treated as an enemy.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know. But... when you talk to<br>
    him... face to face... can you<br>
    honestly say you have no doubts?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    I haven't talked to him.</p>
  <p> Guinan is amazed at this.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see no need --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If you're going to use this person<br>
    --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a Borg, damn it, not a<br>
    person --!</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If you're going to use this person<br>
    to destroy his race, don't you<br>
    think you should look him in the<br>
    eye once before you do it?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Besides... I'm not so sure he is<br>
    Borg anymore.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (fed up)<br>
    Because he's been given a name<br>
    by a member of the crew doesn't<br>
    mean he's no longer Borg. Because<br>
    he's young doesn't mean he's<br>
    innocent. He is what he is and<br>
    in spite of the efforts to turn<br>
    him into some kind of pet -- I<br>
    will not alter our plans.</p>
  <p> Guinan takes this in, eyes him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Fine. But unless you talk to him<br>
    -- at least once -- you might find<br>
    that decision harder to live with<br>
    than you realize.</p>
  <p> And on that note, they hold a look.</p>
  <p>41 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard paces. Then, the call he's been waiting for.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We are ready to transport.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Worf and the Borg MATERIALIZE in the ready room.<br>
    Picard stares at the Borg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You may wait outside, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Worf looks from the Borg to Picard -- he doesn't like<br>
    it, but he EXITS. Picard and Hugh regard each other.<br>
    Neither says anything for a moment; Hugh seems<br>
    bewildered by a dawning recognition.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Locutus...</p>
  <p> Picard realizes that Hugh recognizes him... this<br>
    presents an opportunity. He looks directly at the<br>
    Borg.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I am Locutus... of Borg.</p>
  <p> Confused, Hugh accesses his database -- but there is<br>
    nothing there for him.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Why are you here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is a primitive culture. I<br>
    am here to facilitate its<br>
    incorporation. Identify yourself.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Hugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Identify yourself.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    We are Hugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not a Borg identification.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Hugh hesitates, as though trying to reassess himself.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Third... of five.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This culture will be assimilated.</p>
  <p> Another hesitation.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    They... do not wish it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Irrelevant.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    They will resist us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Resistance is futile.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Resistance... is not futile.</p>
  <p> Picard glares sternly at him. Hugh does not back down.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Some have escaped.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They will be found. It is<br>
    inevitable. All will be<br>
    assimilated.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Must... Geordi be assimilated?</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him, amazed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Hugh hesitates... his thought processes are new,<br>
    strange, uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Geordi does not wish it.<br>
    (trying to explain)<br>
    He would rather die than be<br>
    assimilated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then he will die.</p>
  <p> Hugh looks up at him, clearly disturbed.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    No. Geordi must not die.</p>
  <p> Hugh takes a breath, looks straight at Picard.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Geordi is... a friend.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback by this, but wants to push it a<br>
    bit further.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You will assist us in assimilating<br>
    this vessel.</p>
  <p> Hugh hesitates.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are Borg. You will assist<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> Hugh takes a breath... then...</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    I will not.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him... hears him say the word &quot;I.&quot; He<br>
    backs off from his Locutus role, amazed by what the<br>
    Borg is manifesting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What did you say?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    I will not assist you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;I&quot;... ?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Geordi must not be assimilated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - 3/03/92 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But... you are Borg.</p>
  <p> Another pause...</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    No. I am -- Hugh.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him. This boy has utterly taken him<br>
    aback. Now Picard is in a true dilemma.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>42 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Geordi, Riker, and Beverly. Pick up in<br>
    mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... I think I deliberately avoided<br>
    speaking with the Borg because<br>
    I didn't want anything to get in<br>
    the way of our plan.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But now something has. As far<br>
    as I can tell, he seems to be a<br>
    fully realized individual. He<br>
    has even accepted me as Picard,<br>
    Captain of this ship, and not as<br>
    Locutus.</p>
  <p> There are varying reactions to this... Geordi and<br>
    Beverly on the positive side, Worf and Riker somewhat<br>
    concerned.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then... you've reconsidered the<br>
    plan?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. If we used him in that<br>
    manner, we'd be no better than<br>
    the enemy we seek to destroy.<br>
    I want other options.</p>
  <p> A beat as they consider this delicate issue.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We could return him to the crash<br>
    site... but we'd have to erase<br>
    his memories of being on the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But... if we erase his memories,<br>
    then who he is, who he's become,<br>
    would be destroyed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Isn't that the point? He'd be<br>
    reassimilated into the hive<br>
    without any questions...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It just seems wrong... we help<br>
    turn him into an individual...<br>
    then we take that away from him...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is there a danger that the Borg<br>
    might destroy him -- if they<br>
    discover what's happened?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I doubt it. They have nothing<br>
    to gain by that. It's more likely<br>
    they'll simply wipe out his memory<br>
    of this experience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then either way his memories will<br>
    be erased.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But perhaps...</p>
  <p> He hesitates, realizing that what he is about to say<br>
    might sound improbable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... in the short time before they<br>
    purge those memories... the sense<br>
    of individuality which he has<br>
    gained here will be transmitted<br>
    throughout the Collective.</p>
  <p> They look at him curiously.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every one of the Borg will have<br>
    the opportunity to experience the<br>
    feeling of... singularity.<br>

  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Perhaps that would be the most<br>
    pernicious program of all... the<br>
    knowledge of self, spread through<br>
    the Borg Collective in that brief<br>
    moment, might alter them forever.</p>
  <p> He looks at the group.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will leave his memories intact.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I have only one question.</p>
  <p> The others turn to her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What if he doesn't want to go<br>
    back?</p>
  <p> Various reactions to this question which apparently<br>
    hadn't occurred to them.</p>
  <p>43 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Hugh is looking at Picard's fish tank, intrigued. A<br>
    security guard stands by the door, watching him. The<br>
    door opens and Picard and Geordi ENTER. Picard<br>
    dismisses the guard with a nod.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hello, Hugh.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Hello, Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hugh... a Borg rescue vessel is<br>
    approaching. It will be here<br>
    within three hours. We can return<br>
    you to the crash site, where they<br>
    will find you and take you home.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/04/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Hugh doesn't answer, just watches Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or... if you wish, you may remain<br>
    here with us.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    What I wish... is irrelevant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's not irrelevant. It matters<br>
    to us.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    No Borg leaves the Collective.<br>
    If they find I am missing -- they<br>
    will come for me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hugh, we'll deal with the<br>
    repercussions later. What we must<br>
    know is what you want.</p>
  <p> This is another foreign concept to Hugh. He struggles<br>
    with it.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    You are many. I am one. My needs<br>
    are not important.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't you understand? We're<br>
    giving you a choice.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Choice...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah. Do you want to go back with<br>
    the Borg... or stay with us?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    I could stay with you... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. We would grant you asylum.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Hugh turns away. This is overwhelming to him... the<br>
    idea of choice, the freedom -- and responsibility --<br>
    of making a decision for himself... these are dazzling,<br>
    overpowering concepts.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Choose... what I want...</p>
  <p> He turns back, looks at Geordi, hopeful for a brief<br>
    instant.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    I would choose to stay with<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> But then that flicker dwindles and dies.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    But it is too dangerous. They<br>
    will follow.</p>
  <p> He takes a breath, draws himself up.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Return me to the crash site. It<br>
    is the only way.</p>
  <p> There is a silence as Picard and Geordi assess him...<br>
    understanding the sacrifice he is making.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hugh... think about this... are<br>
    you sure?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> They hold a look which is full of sorrow.</p>
  <p>44 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p>45 OMITTED</p>
  <p>46 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Beverly are there with Hugh; a Transporter<br>
    Chief is behind the console. Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Hugh)<br>
    The Borg ship will enter orbit of<br>
    the moon within an hour. You'll<br>
    soon be headed home.</p>
  <p> Hugh nods, but doesn't speak. Picard turns to Geordi<br>
    and Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll beam him down and take<br>
    position in the star's<br>
    chromosphere. Its interference<br>
    will hide us from their sensors.</p>
  <p> Beverly steps toward Hugh.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Goodbye, Hugh. I'm very glad I<br>
    got to know you.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Goodbye, Beverly.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You saved my life.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Hugh)<br>
    It's not too late to change your<br>
    mind. You can stay here.</p>
  <p> There is the briefest of hesitations, then Hugh shakes<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/06/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    I must return.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, I'd like to go down with<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> Picard considers a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My experience suggests that they<br>
    would ignore him.<br>
    (to Hugh)<br>
    Would you agree?</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    The Borg assimilate civilizations.<br>
    Not individuals.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    But, Captain, they kidnapped<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because they needed a liaison to<br>
    communicate with Humans. The<br>
    Borg ignored every away team we<br>
    sent to their ship, including<br>
    yours, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly acknowledges.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    You may accompany him.</p>
  <p> Geordi steps with Hugh onto the transporter pad.<br>
    Picard looks at Hugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Goodbye.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Captain... I do not want to forget<br>
    that I am Hugh...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard's look reflects his hope that Hugh will be<br>
    successful. Then he turns to the Transporter Chief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> Hugh and Geordi DEMATERIALIZE. Picard stares after<br>
    them... his feelings about the Borg now unalterably<br>
    more complicated.</p>
  <p>47 EXT. CRASH SITE - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Hugh MATERIALIZE into the snowy landscape.<br>
    They move toward the wreckage of the Borg scout ship.<br>
    Hugh gazes at the remains of his ship, the<br>
    still-scattered bodies of his colleagues.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    We found you there... in the<br>
    middle of that debris.</p>
  <p> Hugh nods, stares at the spot.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Then that is where I will wait.</p>
  <p> Geordi gives him a sad nod.</p>
  <p>48 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

    We are now entering position.<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Status of the Borg ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Solar radiation is rendering our<br>
    sensors inoperable. At last known<br>
    course and speed, the Borg vessel<br>
    will enter the system in three<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p>50 EXT. CRASH SITE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Hugh. They are awkward... the time has come<br>
    for goodbyes... neither knows how to say them. Geordi<br>
    is feeling more than he could ever have imagined<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... I guess this is it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So long, Hugh.</p>
  <p> BORG<br>
    Goodbye, Geordi. I will try to<br>
    remember you.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't think of anything else to say, so he nods,<br>
    emotion welling in him. He backs off a little,<br>
    waiting.</p>
  <p>51 ANGLE - TWO BORG (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They MATERIALIZE nearby, somewhat close to Geordi.<br>
    They look around for a moment, their dispassionate gaze<br>
    sweeping past Geordi, and fixing on Hugh. They move<br>
    toward Geordi... but then walk right past him, heading<br>
    for Hugh.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;I, Borg&quot; - REV. 3/5/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>52 ON THE GROUP</p>
  <p> as the two Borg approach Hugh. One of them interfaces<br>
    with him -- connecting through the jacks on their<br>
    prosthetic arms. They are exchanging information.</p>
  <p>53 GEORDI</p>
  <p> doesn't know what this means. Has the Hugh he knew<br>
    been obliterated by assimilation back into the hive?</p>
  <p>54 BACK TO SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> When Hugh moves, it is with the same mechanical gait<br>
    as the others. The three Borg set about scavenging<br>
    the remains of their dead comrades -- they remove the<br>
    technological components they're interested in<br>
    efficiently and without evident emotion. As they<br>
    finish with the dead Borg, the corpses FIZZLE into<br>
    nothingness.</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE - GEORDI</p>
  <p> Geordi is unsure: Hugh seems no different from the<br>
    other Borg... or is he merely acting the part?</p>
  <p>56 REVERSE ANGLE - FROM GEORDI'S POINT OF VIEW<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The three Borg assemble, carrying what they've<br>
    scavenged. They all stare straight ahead as they<br>
    TRANSPORT OUT -- but just before Hugh DEMATERIALIZES he<br>
    turns and looks at Geordi. Their eyes meet, it is<br>
    unmistakable. Then he's gone...</p>
  <p>57 ANGLE - GEORDI</p>
  <p> He is hopeful that this last look means something of<br>
    Hugh will survive assimilation... Still, the thought<br>
    of what lies ahead for Hugh fills him with sadness...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
