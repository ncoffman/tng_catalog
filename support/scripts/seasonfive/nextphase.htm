  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, DATA, and TROI at their stations. ENSIGN<br>
    McDOWELL is at tactical. The ship is on YELLOW ALERT<br>
    and there is a sense of urgency in the air.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We will be within transporter<br>
    range in three minutes twenty-one<br>
    seconds.</p>
  <p> MCDOWELL<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I've finally established audio<br>
    contact with the Romulan ship.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to tactical and gestures to McDowell, who<br>
    then works the console. We HEAR THE VOICE of a ROMULAN<br>
    OFFICER. The transmission is GARBLED and filled with<br>
    STATIC.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN COM VOICE<br>
    (garbled)<br>
    ... main power failing... no way<br>
    to... any ship...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Romulan ship, this is the<br>
    Enterprise. We are en route to<br>
    your position.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN COM VOICE<br>
    (garbled)<br>
    ... Enterprise... critical that<br>
    you... core breach imminent...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They exchange looks. No one has fully heard the<br>
    tranmission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Repeat your last transmission.</p>
  <p> No answer. Picard looks a question to McDowell.</p>
  <p> MCDOWELL<br>
    Sorry, Captain. They've stopped<br>
    transmitting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>3 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> RIKER and WORF are standing near the platform. GEORDI<br>
    and RO ENTER, carrying large tool kits. Everyone has<br>
    tricorders and phasers. CHIEF BROSSMER, a woman in<br>
    her forties, is standing behind the console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Riker here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... transport to the<br>
    Romulan vessel as soon as we're<br>
    in range.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (to others)<br>
    No weapons. We don't want them<br>
    to think they're under attack.</p>
  <p> They turn over their phasers to Brossmer. Ro and Worf<br>
    are reluctant.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (under her breath)<br>
    This is not a bright idea.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    I beg your pardon, Ensign. I<br>
    didn't quite catch that.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (stiffly)<br>
    Nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> They all move up to the transporter pad.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship drops out of warp.</p>
  <p>5 NEW ANGLE - ENTERPRISE &amp; ROMULAN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise moves alongside a ROMULAN SCIENCE SHIP<br>
    which is about half the size of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The engine room is a wreck. There are blown out<br>
    consoles, burnt panels, flames, smoke, DEAD BODIES,<br>
    etc. The room is smaller than engineering on the<br>
    Enterprise and should reflect very different ideas<br>
    about engineering design and philosophy than those we<br>
    are familiar with. Their engine core is a spherical<br>
    device contained within a small chamber which has a<br>
    single open hatch.</p>
  <p> As crewpeople douse the flames, a male Romulan officer<br>
    -- MIROK -- is frantically trying to work a<br>
    recalcitrant console along with a woman -- VAREL.</p>
  <p> The away team MATERIALIZES in the middle of the room.<br>
    The Romulans look at them with astonishment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're from the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise. We received your<br>
    distress call.</p>
  <p> Mirok is somewhat dazed. Geordi and Ro move quickly to<br>
    the engine consoles and open their carrying cases while<br>
    Worf keeps a wary eye on the Romulans.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    The Enterprise... ?</p>
  <p> Mirok is still trying to get his bearings in this<br>
    unexpected situation. But there isn't time to play<br>
    around, and Riker takes charge of the situation.<br>
    Riker's confident and naturally commanding presence<br>
    prompt Mirok to listen to him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right. Your message said<br>
    you'd suffered a failure in your<br>
    engine core.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p>7 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker moves to him and the Romulans follow. Geordi and<br>
    Ro have removed a piece of equipment about the size of<br>
    a footlocker from the console. It looks fused and<br>
    burnt.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: equipment)<br>
    It's a pretty strange set-up, but<br>
    I think the graviton field<br>
    generator has completely<br>
    depolarized. We can't fix it,<br>
    it has to be replaced.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Romulans)<br>
    Where are your replicators?</p>
  <p> VAREL<br>
    They are off-line.</p>
  <p> Riker looks around quickly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who's in charge here?</p>
  <p> The Romulans exchange glances, then Mirok steps forward<br>
    hesitantly.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    The captain is dead. I'm... the<br>
    science officer. Mirok.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    We'd like to take the generator<br>
    back to the Enterprise for<br>
    replication.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    (brief hesitation)<br>
    All right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, you and Ro.</p>
  <p> They nod and then wrestle the graviton generator away<br>
    from the console. Riker and Mirok move to a different<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    La Forge to Brossmer. Two people,<br>
    one piece of equipment to beam<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Ro, Geordi, and the generator begin to DEMATERIALIZE...<br>
    then something goes wrong... their images FUZZ and<br>
    SPARK strangely.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Brossmer is struggling to bring them aboard... STRANGE<br>
    SHAPES and EFFECTS dance on the transporter pad.<br>
    It's unlike any transporter effect we've seen before.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    What the hell...<br>
    (urgent, to com)<br>
    Engineering, I need more power<br>
    to the primary energizing coil.</p>
  <p> More EFFECTS on the stage. Brossmer keeps working,<br>
    but she can't get anywhere.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER<br>
    Brossmer to Commander Riker. I'm<br>
    losing them -- I have to abort.<br>
    They should be returning to your<br>
    coordinates.</p>
  <p> The EFFECTS STOP on the stage.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>9 INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf wait for them to reappear... nothing.<br>
    After a long beat...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (urgent, to com)<br>
    Chief, they're not here. Do you<br>
    have them?</p>
  <p> BROSSMER<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where are they?</p>
  <p> Long beat as Brossmer works. Finally...</p>
  <p> BROSSMER<br>
    (in shock)<br>
    I can't locate their patterns.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We've lost them, sir. They're<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> Off Riker's shocked expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/16/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Only a few minutes have passed since the end of the<br>
    Teaser. Picard and Troi are reacting to the loss of Ro<br>
    &amp; Geordi.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm sorry, Captain. But there's<br>
    just nothing left to retrieve.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Begin a level one diagnostic.<br>
    All transporter systems to remain<br>
    off-line until further notice.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Could they have materialized<br>
    somewhere else?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Negative, Captain. Sensors are<br>
    unable to find them within<br>
    transporter range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> Troi waits a beat and silently &quot;listens&quot;... but her<br>
    expression is grim. She shakes her head. That seems<br>
    to seal the fate of their friends. But there is no<br>
    time to mourn.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Number One.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/16/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker is standing off by himself in the engine room.<br>
    He has to put aside his feelings for now to deal with<br>
    the emergency.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we're still looking at<br>
    a core breach unless we can<br>
    fashion a new graviton generator.<br>
    I need...<br>
    (beat, then bluntly)<br>
    I need replacement personnel, sir.</p>
  <p>11A RESUME BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, you may continue your<br>
    diagnostic of the transporter<br>
    system later. Take a shuttlecraft<br>
    and two more engineers to the<br>
    Romulan ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to McDowell)<br>
    Mister McDowell, alert the main<br>
    shuttlebay to have all available<br>
    ships and pilots standing by in<br>
    case we need them.</p>
  <p> MCDOWELL<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Conn Officer)<br>
    Lay in a course to take us away<br>
    from the Romulan ship at Warp One<br>
    in case it explodes.</p>
  <p> The Conn Officer nods and works the console. Orders<br>
    given, Picard moves back to the command area and sits<br>
    down. Hold a beat on his expression as he takes a beat<br>
    to reflect on his lost crewmen.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; ROMULAN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships as seen before.</p>
  <p>13 INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker moves to where Mirok and Varel are working on a<br>
    console. The atmosphere is tense and urgent.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    (worried, off console)<br>
    Pressure in the containment<br>
    chamber has increased fifteen<br>
    melakols in the last two minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mirok)<br>
    What can we do to stop the<br>
    overload?</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    Most of the conduits were damaged<br>
    in the explosion. I can't even<br>
    access the central computer.</p>
  <p>14 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Worf and an N.D. Romulan ENTER through a doorway.<br>
    They both look dirty and bedraggled.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Emergency bulkheads have sealed<br>
    this section from the rest of the<br>
    ship. There is no way to gain<br>
    access to the bridge or other<br>
    control centers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Survivors?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Readings indicate at least<br>
    seventy-three Romulans are still<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> VAREL<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Seventy-three...</p>
  <p> Suddenly there is an ALARM from the console. Mirok and<br>
    Varel quickly examine the readings and are horrified<br>
    at the result.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    The pressure has jumped two<br>
    hundred melakols!</p>
  <p> VAREL<br>
    I've lost control of the<br>
    containment chamber!</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    It's going to implode...</p>
  <p> Riker takes charge of the situation. The Romulans<br>
    accept his leadership without question at this point.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll have to dump the entire<br>
    engine core. Do you have an<br>
    auto-eject system?</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    Yes, but it's not functioning.<br>
    I'll have to do it manually.</p>
  <p> Mirok runs over to a bulkhead near the chamber and<br>
    rips open a panel. He begins frantically working<br>
    controls within the panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, you two seal the chamber.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf and the N.D. run inside the chamber and begin<br>
    pulling out optical conduit and power leads connecting<br>
    the sphere-shaped chamber to the walls.</p>
  <p> VAREL<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Implosion will occur in one minute<br>
    five seconds...</p>
  <p> As the following dialog takes place, Worf and the N.D.<br>
    finish disconnecting the conduits and run out of the<br>
    chamber. They start to close the door leading to the<br>
    chamber, but there is a large beam blocking the way.<br>
    They struggle to move it, but it's too heavy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Riker to Enterprise. We're<br>
    preparing to jettison the engine<br>
    core. We'll need you to extend<br>
    shields once it clears the hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood, Number One. We'll<br>
    stand by for your signal.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander!</p>
  <p> Riker turns and sees the difficulty they're having with<br>
    the beam and the door. He and Varel rush over and help<br>
    them move the beam...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (as he pulls on beam,<br>
    to Varel)<br>
    Time?</p>
  <p> VAREL<br>
    Thirty seconds...</p>
  <p> The beam finally crashes to the deck. They try to pull<br>
    the doors shut... they get halfway, then jam. Mirok<br>
    sits up.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    Ready!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (straining against door)<br>
    Stay there! Eject the chamber<br>
    on my order!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> But it's futile... they can't move it at all. A tense<br>
    beat and then suddenly we HEAR DATA'S VOICE.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Excuse me, sir.</p>
  <p>15 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing Data and TWO N.D. ENGINEERS now standing in<br>
    the engine room. Riker and Worf step aside as Data<br>
    moves quickly to the jammed doors. With a burst of<br>
    android strength, he PULLS the doors together and seals<br>
    the chamber.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mirok)<br>
    Now!</p>
  <p> Mirok works a control and the ship SHAKES ONCE as the<br>
    chamber is ejected. The lights go OUT.</p>

  <p> The two ships are side by side. Suddenly, there is a<br>
    flash of LIGHT from the bottom of the Romulan ship and<br>
    an EXPLOSION a short distance away from the ship. But<br>
    the blast from the explosion is kept away from the two<br>
    ships by the shields of the Enterprise, which now<br>
    surround both vessels. (It is the explosion which<br>
    makes the shields visible.)</p>
  <p>17 INT. ROMULAN ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> As before. The room SHAKES slightly then stops.<br>
    Everyone is standing still in the gloomy darkness.<br>
    After a beat, Riker turns to Mirok and a slow smile<br>
    spreads across his face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mirok)<br>
    Well... we're still here.</p>

  <p> MIROK<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> It's a unique moment... Starfleet and Romulan<br>

  <p> The ship hangs in space.</p>
  <p>19 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is listening to Riker's report.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    We'll have a complete power survey<br>
    done within the hour... we'll<br>
    probably have to supply them with<br>
    energy for life support... and<br>
    they're definitely going to need<br>
    a new engine core to get home<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Understood, Commander. Keep us<br>
    informed of your efforts. Picard<br>
    out.<br>
    (to McDowell)<br>
    I'll be in sickbay.</p>
  <p> MCDOWELL<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from a turbolift. He walks along the<br>
    corridor, lost in thought... his expression is grim and<br>
    deeply disturbed. Follow him for a moment... then as<br>
    he rounds a corner CAMERA DROPS OFF ON Ensign Ro, who<br>
    is sitting near a corridor intersection.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Ro is just waking up... she's groggy and disoriented.<br>
    She puts a hand to her head and rubs her eyes for a<br>
    moment, trying to clear the cobwebs. N.D. CREWMEN pass<br>
    her, without seeing her. (NOTE: From this point on,<br>
    no one can see Ro. She is invisible to everyone<br>
    aboard the ship.)</p>
  <p> Ro stands up and looks around... finally decides that<br>
    something has gone wrong, although she's not sure<br>
    exactly what. She hits her communicator.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Ensign Ro to bridge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is Ensign Ro, reporting in...<br>
    I'm in section twenty-three baker,<br>
    near sickbay.</p>
  <p> Still nothing. She frowns at the recalcitrant<br>
    communicator... then she suddenly gets dizzy... she<br>
    shakes her head and the dizziness goes away.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (to herself)<br>
    Sickbay...</p>
  <p> Ro walks along the empty corridor toward sickbay.</p>
  <p>21 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Ro reaches sickbay. When she gets to the door, she<br>
    pulls up short as it refuses to open. Before she can<br>
    reach out to touch the door in puzzlement, it suddenly<br>
    OPENS and a N.D. CREWPERSON ENTERS the corridor from<br>
    sickbay. He barrels past her without a glance. (To<br>
    Ro, he seems rude, but again, the Crewman never sees<br>
    her.) Ro gives him an irritated look and goes through<br>
    the still open door before it closes behind her.</p>
  <p>22 INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Ro ENTERS. N.D. NURSES &amp; PATIENTS go about their<br>
    business without noticing Ro standing near the doorway.<br>
    She tries to get their attention.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I need some help.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/17/92 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (louder)<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> Still nothing. What's going on here? Ro moves toward<br>
    Beverly's office to see if she can get someone to<br>
    listen to her over there.</p>
  <p>23 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and BEVERLY are in the middle of an argument in<br>
    the office. Ro pauses in the doorway, naturally<br>
    reluctant to interrupt the conversation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The transporter could've beamed<br>
    them somewhere else... the Romulan<br>
    ship, another deck of the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    We've already checked those<br>
    possibilities.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The preliminary findings indicate<br>
    there was a radiation surge from<br>
    the Romulan engine core which<br>
    disrupted the signal. They never<br>
    rematerialized.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We should check again, there might<br>
    be something we overlooked and---</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gentle, but firm)<br>
    We've done all we can, Beverly.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a beat... then reluctantly agrees.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're right. I just... hate<br>
    making out death certificates.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did Ensign Ro have any family?</p>
  <p> Ro is shocked -- they think she's dead!</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Captain, I'm right here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Beverly sits at the desk... the weariness of losing too<br>
    many shipmates is clear on her face.</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard turns to leave Beverly alone. Ro steps directly<br>
    in his path, determined to put a stop to this for once<br>
    and for all.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Captain, I don't know what's going<br>
    on --</p>
  <p> But Picard is still unaware of her presence and he<br>
    walks straight toward her... and then WALKS THROUGH<br>
    Ro. She is completely shocked. Picard continues on<br>
    his way and Beverly doesn't know anything has happened.<br>
    Ro looks down at her body in utter disbelief. Off her<br>
    shocked expression...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>25 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous from Act One. Ro is trying to get her<br>
    bearings in this bizarre situation. She can't believe<br>
    what just happened with Picard. Beverly is still<br>
    sitting at her desk, working at a terminal. Ro tries<br>
    once again to get her attention.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Doctor Crusher? Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly ignores her completely. Ro's frustration<br>
    mounts.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm right here...</p>
  <p> Beverly placidly continues working on her report. Ro's<br>
    temper snaps.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (shouts)<br>
    Dammnit, Doctor!</p>
  <p> Ro tries to slam her hand on the desk to get Beverly's<br>
    attention... but her hand simply PASSES THROUGH the<br>
    desk. Ro yanks her hand away in shock. She looks at<br>
    her hands in amazement... Ro claps them together...<br>
    they seem solid enough to her. She makes a fist and<br>
    smacks it into the palm of the other hand... no<br>
    problem. Ro touches the desk gently. She can touch<br>
    the surface if she doesn't press too hard. (Think<br>
    of objects as if they were made of Jello -- you can<br>
    touch it, but if you push too hard, you go right<br>
    through it.)</p>
  <p>26 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Ro moves around the desk behind Beverly. She leans<br>
    over Beverly to see what she's doing on the terminal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - 3/15/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>27 CLOSE ON TERMINAL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The terminal was showing a picture of Geordi and some<br>
    biographical information. It quickly changes to a<br>
    picture of Ro and her bio information. Beverly reaches<br>
    out and touches a control... the word &quot;DECEASED&quot;<br>
    suddenly appears at the bottom of the file.</p>
  <p>28 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> As Ro reacts to this. Beverly is resigned... a little<br>
    sad. Ro is starting to come to the frightening<br>
    realization that this is all very real.</p>

    N.D. ROMULANS and N.D. STARFLEET CREWMEN are moving<br>
    busily about the room in the b.g. hauling equipment,<br>

  <p> Mirok looks up at Riker and smiles.</p>
  <p> MIROK<br>
    The main power grid is on-line.</p>
  <p> Riker returns the smile and even gives Mirok a friendly<br>

    Federation/Romulan relations.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>

  <p> Picard and Data are at one of the aft stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. What is the status of their<br>
    engine replacement?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engineering is modifying one of<br>
    our subspace resonators to act<br>
    as a new engine core. It won't<br>
    do more than warp two, but it'll<br>
    get them home.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I have a personal favor to ask.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I considered Commander La Forge<br>
    to be my best friend. I feel it<br>
    is my responsibility to plan and<br>
    conduct the memorial service.<br>
    May I have your permission to do<br>
    so?</p>
  <p> Picard is moved by this reminder of the tragedy -- and<br>
    by Data's desire to commemorate his friend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Permission granted. Make<br>
    whatever arrangements you find<br>
    appropriate.</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Romulans want a computer.<br>
    We cannot give them access to<br>
    Federation technology. It is an<br>
    unacceptable security risk.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about a computer from thirty<br>
    or forty years ago... one the<br>
    Romulans are already familiar<br>
    with?</p>
  <p> Worf ponders this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That would be satisfactory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Check with the Enterprise to see<br>
    what's available. But be sure<br>
    your security concerns are<br>

    No one can see me either.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't figure out what happened.<br>
    One minute we were transporting<br>

    We're dead, Geordi.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a moment to take that in. He looks at<br>
    Ro as if she's lost her mind. He gives a forced laugh.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Is that some kind of joke?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Our patterns were lost in a<br>

    on the console... then gets up to go check something<br>
    at the aft science stations. Ro takes the opportunity<br>
    to gently run her hand over the console as she<br>
    silently says goodbye to this life. She looks up<br>

  <p> Data passes the tricorder over Geordi without pausing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's interesting... you're<br>
    picking up chroniton readings in<br>
    here, but not from me.</p>
  <p> Data pauses and makes a few more adjustments to the<br>
    tricorder. Geordi cranes his neck around in order to<br>
    see the small tricorder screen. Data scans the room<br>
    again... finally stopping on one section of wall.<br>
    Data moves to that section of wall and Geordi follows.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's a field in this wall?<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Data picks up the anyon emitter and makes a few<br>
    adjustments. Geordi suddenly understands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (getting excited)<br>
    Data, I came through this wall.<br>
    I walked right through it when<br>
    I came in here...</p>
  <p> Data points the anyon emitter at the wall. A SOUND<br>
    comes out of the device as he plays it on the wall.<br>
    He shuts OFF the device after a moment and then checks<br>
    the tricorder again.</p>
  <p> GEORI<br>
    (over action)<br>
    When the phased matter in my body<br>
    passed through the wall, it<br>
    must've distrupted the wall's<br>
    molecular structure... producing<br>
    a chroniton field.</p>
  <p> Data moves to a new area of wall. Geordi stares at him<br>
    in frustration.</p>

  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data activates the device and sprays the wall. Geordi<br>
    watches for beat... then gets an idea. Geordi goes<br>
    to the pool table as Data SHUTS OFF the device and pulls<br>
    out his tricorder. As Data scans, Geordi walks THROUGH<br>
    the pool table. Data picks up the reading... is<br>
    puzzled... SPRAYS the pool table with the device.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, I'm right here... that's<br>
    me you're reading...</p>
  <p> Geordi continues to walk through the pool table...<br>
    each time, Data patiently reads the tricorder and<br>
    sprays the field -- but with increasing puzzlement.</p>

    He spoke of a plan to return to<br>

  <p> Ro glances down at the disruptor in Parem's hand.<br>
    Parem knows what she's thinking.</p>
  <p> PAREM<br>
    Yes, this disruptor works. I was<br>

    it's me!</p>
  <p> Data is definitely puzzled by the continued obstinance<br>
    of these fields. He makes another adjustment to the<br>
    anyon emitter and points it at the pool table. He<br>
    SPRAYS the pool table again, but this time the invisible<br>
    beam accidently HITS Geordi's arm. Geordi recoils as if<br>
    hit with a mild electric shock.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, watch where you point that<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p> He flexes his hand... it feels strange...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wait a minute, Data... you did<br>
    something to me...</p>
  <p> He reaches out experimentally and tries to push his<br>
    hand through the pool table again. There is resistance<br>
    this time... he can't move it through so easily<br>
    anymore.</p>

    No, no, no. Don't give up on<br>

    A MAN and a WOMAN are sitting at the table... the<br>
    remains of an intimate dinner still on the table before<br>
    them. He is feeding her oysters and there is a<br>
    sexually-charged tension between the two of them. She<br>
    eats the oyster and then washes it down with<br>
    champagne... he leans over and whispers something funny<br>
    into her ear... she laughs and runs a hand over his<br>
    cheek... then she picks up some food and feeds it to<br>
    him...</p>
  <p> Midway through the above action, Ro suddenly races<br>
    INTO the room... but Parem is gaining on her and he<br>
    comes much closer behind her this time. He FIRES his<br>

    advantage of Parem's momentary inattention to KNOCK<br>
    the disruptor out of his hand. Parem knocks her to<br>

    Look around you, Data. People<br>
    are sharing memories of Geordi<br>
    and Ro... talking, laughing...<br>
    I don't know what could be more<br>
    appropriate.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am glad you approve, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Brossmer to Commander Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Go ahead, Chief.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir, we've cleared the critical<br>
    areas of chronitons... but we've<br>
    detected a new field forming in<br>
    Ten Forward that is stronger than<br>
    any we've seen before. Should<br>
    I wait until the service is over<br>
    before beginning decontamination?</p>
  <p> Ro and Geordi exchange looks... this is it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. Anyonic emissions are<br>
    harmless. Please begin<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Ro moves a little away from Data and Troi,<br>
    positioning themselves to be seen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Here we go...</p>
  <p> The SOUND of the anyon effect is heard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/25/92 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>74C CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Ro REACT SLIGHTLY... as if hit with a MILD<br>
    electric shock. Geordi quickly moves to Worf, who is<br>
    calmly drinking at the bar.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf! Worf, can you see me?</p>
  <p> Worf continues to placidly drink and sample the food<br>
    at the bar. Geordi and Ro move away from him in<br>
    frustration.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We have to find a way to increase<br>
    the emission strength.</p>
  <p> They are now close enough to Picard and Beverly to<br>
    overhear the following:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    ... if she hadn't lost her rank<br>
    following the incident at Garon<br>
    Four, I think she would've made<br>
    lieutenant commander by now.</p>
  <p> N.D. ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> N.D. ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Incoming message from Garadius<br>
    Four, sir. The diplomatic<br>
    situation is deteriorating. They<br>
    want an update on our ETA.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/25/92 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>74C CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by, Ensign.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to Data as Geordi and Ro react.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    We've got to do something now,<br>
    before they go to warp.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    The disruptor... I can set it on<br>
    overload.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> As Ro sets the disruptor, Picard begins talking to<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me, Mister Data.<br>
    (Data turns)</p>
  <p> Ro finishes making her adjustments and presses a final<br>
    button. A LOUD WHINE comes from the weapon. Ro sets<br>
    it down.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Let's go!</p>
  <p> They go streaking for the farthest point in the room.<br>
    Picard's following dialog should take place over the<br>
    above action.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (over action)<br>
    I'd like to get under way as<br>
    soon as possible. The situation<br>
    on Garadius Four is becoming<br>
    serious.</p>

  <p>75B WIDEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The WHINE grows LOUDER. Then the disruptor EXPLODES<br>
    in a blinding FLASH. No one pays any attention. Only<br>
    Geordi and Ro are affected, and stumble against a far<br>
    wall as the blast reaches them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I see no reason to delay our<br>
    departure, Captain. The chroniton<br>
    fields have been cleared from all<br>
    critical areas.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> Ro and Geordi approach once more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Mister McDowell, set course for<br>
    Gardius Four and engage at---</p>
  <p> Brossmer suddenly interrupts with an urgent message.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Commander Data, chroniton field<br>
    strength in Ten Forward has just<br>
    increased by three thousand<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled by this)<br>
    Curious.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I believe it would be best if we<br>
    decontaminate this room before<br>
    getting underway, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Chief Brossmer, increase anyonic<br>
    emissions to six thousand<br>
    particles per second and<br>
    decontaminate the area.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/25/92 - ACT FIVE 63B.</p>
  <p>75B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Ro)<br>
    Hang on.</p>
  <p> The SOUND of the anyon beam is HEARD again. This time<br>
    Geordi and Ro feel like they're hit with a STRONGER<br>
    electric SHOCK. They wave their arms and try to get<br>
    someone's attention.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, we're here! Can you see<br>
    us?</p>
  <p>75C CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he reacts to something.</p>
  <p>75D GEORDI AND RO - PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MATERIALIZE for a flickering instant, almost<br>
    subliminally, arms waving. The SOUND stops. Note:<br>
    Only a few people in the room see this -- everyone else<br>
    continues to drink, laugh, be merry, etc.</p>
  <p>75E BACK TO PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Did you see that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Ro and Geordi react with joy...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come on, Data... put it together<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/25/92 - ACT FIVE 63C.</p>
  <p>75E CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It wasn't ghosts, Mister Data...<br>
    what did we see?</p>
  <p> Data's circuits are racing, trying to put together<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I may know what has<br>
    happened...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Please be right, Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (musing, half to<br>
    himself)<br>
    ... it would explain the mysterious<br>
    chroniton fields...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes, yes, yes...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... if they were cloaked in some<br>
    way...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying you think they're<br>
    still alive?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I am right, they are -- and<br>
    in this room. Their brief<br>
    appearance coincided with the<br>
    anyonic sweep. Perhaps the anyons<br>
    neutralize the cloaking effect.<br>

    Data to Chief Brossmer. Set the<br>
    anoynic beam to its highest level<br>
    and flood Ten Forward.</p>
  <p> BROSSMER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard and Data look a bit puzzled; Geordi and Ro brace<br>
    themselves.</p>

  <p> Conversation in the room comes to a halt as everyone<br>
    looks at the shapes MATERIALIZING before them. Finally<br>
    the shapes resolve themselves and Ro and Geordi APPEAR.<br>
    They stagger to their feet as a shocked hush fills the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Next Phase&quot; - REV. 3/20/92 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (urgent, to Data)<br>
    Data -- Can you see me?</p>
  <p> Data is probably the only one in the room capable of<br>
    answering that question at the moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (simply)<br>
    Of course.</p>

  <p> ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Who gave that order?</p>
  <p> Picard recovers from his shock before anyone else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    That was Commander Geordi La<br>
    Forge, Ensign. Please follow his<br>
    instructions.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Everyone is still staring at Geordi and Ro.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Looks like a great party. Mind<br>
    if we join you?</p>
  <p> That breaks the shocked silence, and everyone crowds<br>
    around Geordi and Ro, amazed and curious.</p>

  <p> The party is over, the place is a mess and there is<br>
    no one there -- except Geordi and Ro, sitting at a<br>
    table. It is heaped with food. Geordi is still eating<br>
    ravenously, but Ro is not showing much interest in the<br>
    food.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Could you pass the rolls?</p>
  <p> Ro passes a plate, but is clearly preoccupied.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You've been eating for an hour...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We didn't have anything to eat<br>
    for almost two days. I'm starved.</p>
  <p> Ro nods and smiles wanly.</p>

    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Nothing...</p>
  <p> She begins drawing little circles on the table with<br>
    a bread stick.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I was raised with Bajoran<br>
    beliefs... and I even followed<br>
    some of the practices, but...<br>
    I never really believed in life<br>
    after death. Then suddenly I was<br>
    dead and there was another life.<br>
    It made me feel like I'd been...<br>
    pretty arrogant to discount all<br>
    I'd been taught. Now... I don't<br>
    know what to believe...</p>
  <p> Geordi puts down his fork and considers her for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe we should develop our own<br>
    interphase device...<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    ... if it can teach Ro Laren<br>
    humility, it can do anything.</p>
  <p> She looks at him... there's a beat... and then they<br>
    both share a laugh.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You know... I think I am hungry<br>
    after all.</p>
  <p> He grins and passes her a plate of food and they dig<br>
