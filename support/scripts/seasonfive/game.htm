    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 OMITTED</p>
  <p>2 INT. RIKER'S ROOM - RISA - NIGHT</p>
  <p> A plush bedroom suite, with a picturesque view of<br>
    Risa through a large, open window. There are several<br>
    platters of exotic-looking hors d'oeuvres around the<br>
    room... not to mention an empty bottle of fine<br>
    champagne.</p>
  <p> RIKER is standing near a long screen/partition,<br>
    dressed in casual clothes (perhaps a robe), looking<br>
    flushed with excitement. He calls out in a playful<br>
    tone of voice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Etana...</p>
  <p> No response. He takes a step toward the screen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know you're back there...<br>
    don't make me come after you.</p>
  <p> A rustling NOISE from behind the screen. Then a<br>
    shadow, barely visible at a far end of the screen.<br>
    Riker edges toward the far end... quiet as a cat...<br>
    and lunges for it, simultaneously pulling back the<br>
    screen --</p>
  <p> A clothing rack heaped with robes falls onto Riker,<br>
    draping him with fabric. A WOMAN grabs Riker from<br>
    behind and gives him a playful squeeze -- then dangles<br>
    a Starfleet communicator in front of his face. Before<br>
    Riker can grab her, she bolts across the room, romping<br>
    gleefully.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: communicator)<br>
    Give me that...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He goes after her. The woman is alien, gorgeous, with<br>
    a full, flowing mane of hair. This is ETANA JOL.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    You don't need this.</p>
  <p> Riker edges toward her... backing her toward a wall.<br>
    The dynamic between them is playful, teasing, charged<br>
    with erotic tension.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... I... do...</p>
  <p> They match each other's movement, a game of cat and<br>
    mouse. Etana holds the communicator up to her mouth,<br>
    pretends to speak into it.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    (mocks Riker's voice)<br>
    Commander Riker to the<br>
    Enterprise. I've got a problem<br>
    down here on Risa!</p>
  <p> She laughs. Riker lunges for her. She dodges, but<br>
    Riker's too quick. He pins her against the wall next<br>
    to the window -- presses close against her. Etana<br>
    grips the communicator in her hand and raises her arm,<br>
    keeping it out of reach.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Give it to me.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Go get it.</p>
  <p> She tosses the communicator out the window. It falls<br>
    into the darkness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't believe you did that.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Believe it.</p>
  <p> She throws herself forward, catching Riker off<br>
    balance, sending both of them sprawling to the floor.<br>
    They flop onto a mound of oversized pillows -- Riker<br>
    on his back, Etana on top of him. They roll to the<br>
    side, engaged in a kiss. Then Etana breaks away and<br>
    looks into Riker's eyes...</p>
  <p> She sits up and begins to massage Riker's shoulders.<br>
    The exuberant pace of their play slows down a little.<br>
    Riker enjoys the shoulder rub. He sighs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Etana continues... leans down and kisses him on the<br>
    forehead. Riker smiles. She moves her focus to<br>
    Riker's temples, gently rubbing...</p>
  <p> ... and pulls something out of her robe -- a small<br>
    crescent-shaped DEVICE that resembles a skimmed-down<br>
    headset. Gradually, as a natural extension of the<br>
    massage, she slips the device around Riker's ear.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    What's this?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    It's a game. Everyone here's<br>
    playing it.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles, likes the idea. Etana hooks the game<br>
    around his ear to hold it in place -- while a thin<br>
    mechanical &quot;arm&quot; extends in front of his eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do I keep my eyes open, or<br>
    closed?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Open.</p>
  <p> Riker waits as Etana activates the game -- tiny lights<br>
    on its exterior come alive.</p>
  <p>3 CLOSE ON RIKER'S FACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two micro-thin LASERS emit from the arm extension and<br>
    scan Riker's face, the lights gliding across his<br>
    features. Quickly the lasers zero in on his eyes --<br>
    specifically, his pupils -- then vanish. This<br>
    establishes a connection between Riker and the game.</p>
  <p>4 RESUME</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to something only he can see.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What am I seeing?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    The playing field.</p>
  <p> Riker is captivated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/4/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 RIKER'S POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We see Riker's view of his surroundings (the room,<br>
    Etana), with a semi-translucent GAME OVERLAY<br>
    superimposed on the scene. The overlay is an optical<br>
    grid pattern, with a cone and a disc across it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now what?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    See the disc and the cone?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Concentrate... Make the disc go<br>
    into the cone...</p>
  <p> Riker concentrates. His mental effort causes the disc<br>
    to skitter about, but it misses the cone. The game is<br>
    simple but exciting.</p>
  <p> Riker laughs, enchanted with the game.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do I do this?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Relax... just let go. You'll do<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Etana continues to rub his shoulders. He concentrates --<br>
    sending out more bursts -- but they keep missing the<br>
    cone. Finally, the disc drops right into the cone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got it.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Riker's entire body tenses up. A moment,<br>
    then he relaxes and lets out a small gasp. Like he's<br>
    experienced a brief moment of internal pleasure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: sensation)<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Your reward. For clearing the<br>
    first level.</p>
  <p> Riker is amazed... and delighted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How far does this game go?</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    As far as you can take it. You<br>
    want to try for level two?</p>
  <p> Riker grins -- &quot;You bet.&quot; Four dots appear on the<br>
    playing field. Riker focuses his attention on the<br>
    game -- sending out the bursts. This time he wins<br>
    quickly -- all four dots are eliminated with just a<br>
    few bursts. As Riker lets out a gasp of even greater<br>
    pleasure...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>

  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45208.2.<br>
    Commander Riker has rejoined the<br>
    Enterprise from Risa. And we are<br>
    on our way to an uncharted area<br>
    called the Phoenix Cluster.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, DATA, WORF, and SUPERNUMERARIES at positions.<br>
    VARIOUS CREWMEMBERS are working at the science<br>
    stations. The bridge is alive with activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We are all anticipating this<br>
    historic first look at the<br>
    region.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS from the turbolift, looking fit and rested.<br>
    He heads for the command area, where Picard is working<br>
    his armrest controls. Riker sits down at his chair,<br>
    eager to resume his duties.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Things are getting busy around<br>
    here. Five more science teams<br>
    just beamed in from the Zhukov.<br>
    Quarters are filling up fast.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods; concerned)<br>
    And on top of everything, there's<br>
    been a change. We now have only<br>
    two weeks to complete the<br>
    exploration.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Two weeks... that's not enough<br>
    time to explore a region that<br>
    size. I thought we had five<br>
    weeks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Starfleet has added a diplomatic<br>
    mission to Oceanus Four.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker activates the information viewer next to his<br>
    chair and scans the mission orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will, I'm leaving it up to you to<br>
    make sure all science departments<br>
    have an equal chance to complete<br>
    their research.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It'll be quite a juggling act.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to lighten the tone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A bit of good news, as well.<br>
    We're to rendezvous with a<br>
    shuttlecraft carrying Wesley<br>
    Crusher. He's on vacation from<br>
    the Academy.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, pleasantly surprised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wesley... good. We'll need an<br>
    extra hand around here.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles -- it's clear they're both looking<br>
    forward to seeing Wesley again.</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> It's a busy day. GEORDI and various ENGINEERING NDS<br>
    are hard at work... including a striking young woman<br>
    named ROBIN LEFLER, who's at an opened panel,<br>
    organizing a pile of isolinear chips.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS and approaches Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi... how are you coming with<br>
    the survey preparations?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm up to my neck in observation<br>
    schedules right now.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes Riker to a console, shows him a rundown<br>
    of information.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our biggest hurdle is sensor<br>
    availability.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Especially since two new<br>
    exobiologists and three stellar<br>
    cartographers joined us from the<br>
    Zhukov.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fifteen science teams, only two<br>
    weeks, and one long-range array<br>
    don't make a great combination.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about the lateral sensors?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They're booked solid for<br>
    planetary observation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the gamma ray scanner?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're reprogramming it now...<br>
    (to Robin)<br>
    Lefler... will you join us,<br>
    please?</p>
  <p> Robin sets down her work and joins the two men.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know Robin Lefler.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Her performance around here has<br>
    been sensational. I've decided<br>
    to make her a mission specialist.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Robin)<br>
    Congratulations.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay, specialist -- what's our<br>
    sensor status?</p>
  <p> Robin takes a deep breath -- this is her first time<br>
    reporting to high-level officers -- but she's<br>
    confident.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    We're increasing the available<br>
    bandwidth... so more science<br>
    teams can use the sensors at<br>
    once. We figured out a way to do<br>
    it by multiplexing the array.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will it be ready by the time we<br>
    arrive?</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Yessir. You can count on it.</p>
  <p> Riker looks pleased.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Keep it up, Lefler.</p>
  <p> Robin smiles, nods, returns to her work. Geordi moves<br>
    to another console. Riker follows him...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi... I brought something<br>
    back from Risa. You've got to<br>
    try it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd love to. But I'm running a<br>
    full sensor recalibration in ten<br>
    minutes. Can it wait?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sure. I'll catch up with you<br>
    later.</p>
  <p> Geordi's already reabsorbed in his work. A beat, then<br>
    Riker EXITS...</p>
  <p>9 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi is sitting alone in a corner, contemplating a<br>
    large and luscious chocolate fudge sundae.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She carefully removes the cherry and sets it beside<br>
    the dish. Slowly, she spoons off first bite. Riker<br>
    walks up behind her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: sundae)<br>
    Chocolate ice cream. Chocolate<br>
    fudge. Chocolate chips. You're<br>
    not depressed, are you?</p>
  <p> Troi reacts, a little embarrassed about being caught<br>
    with the large dessert.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm fine, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: sundae)<br>
    Did you want to be alone with<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. You can join us.</p>
  <p> Riker sits down. Troi offers him the spoonful. He<br>
    declines.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't like fudge.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Really. I never met a chocolate<br>
    I didn't like.</p>
  <p> Troi takes the bite... and her expression turns<br>
    serious, like she's analyzing something in her mind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doesn't it taste good?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course it does. But it's not<br>
    just a matter of taste. It's the<br>
    whole experience.</p>
  <p> Riker is curious. Troi demonstrates, an expert on the<br>
    subject.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    First you spoon the fudge from<br>
    around the rim... leaving only<br>
    ice cream in the middle...<br>
    (eats a bite)<br>
    Then gently spoon the ice cream<br>
    around the sides, like you're<br>
    sculpting it...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/30/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    (another bite)<br>
    Relish every bite. Make every<br>
    one an event. And on the last<br>
    bite, close your eyes...</p>
  <p> She closes her eyes and eats a spoonful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I never knew it was a ritual.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Chocolate is a serious thing.</p>
  <p> Riker leans close to her, speaks in an intimate tone<br>
    of voice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know... I brought something<br>
    back from Risa. It's better than<br>
    chocolate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh... what is it?</p>
  <p> A beat. Riker's response is almost a tease.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just a game.</p>

  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN at the controls. WESLEY CRUSHER MATERIALIZES<br>
    on the transporter stage. He wears a Starfleet<br>
    Academy Cadet uniform, and carries a travel bag. He<br>
    looks a little more mature. At the sight of O'Brien,<br>
    he smiles and steps down off the stage.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Chief O'Brien!</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Welcome back, Wesley.</p>
  <p> They shake hands.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Congratulations on little Molly.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (proud)<br>
    Thanks. Wait till you see her --<br>
    she's the spitting image of her<br>
    dad.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles, then looks around the room, suddenly<br>
    aware that no one else is present.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    So... where is everyone? Is my<br>
    mom around?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The senior staff is holding a<br>
    meeting. You're supposed to go<br>
    to your mother's quarters.</p>
  <p> The statement catches Wesley offguard -- he was<br>
    expecting a warmer welcome.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh. Well, do you think it'd be<br>
    alright if I stopped by... just<br>
    to say hi?</p>
  <p> O'Brien thinks a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT TWO 13.</p>

    Chief O'Brien to bridge.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge here.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Wesley Crusher has arrived and<br>
    wants to know if he can stop by<br>
    the observation lounge...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    To say &quot;hi&quot;.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    That is acceptable.</p>
  <p> O'Brien looks to Wesley, who's somewhat disturbed by<br>
    the chilly reception he's receiving.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> O'Brien nods. Wesley EXITS...</p>
  <p>11 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> The room is dark. The doors slide open and Wesley<br>
    ENTERS. A beat, then the lights come on and several<br>
    VOICES call out in greeting -- &quot;Hello! Welcome home!&quot;</p>
  <p>12 REVEAL SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Troi, Worf, Geordi and BEVERLY<br>
    all in the room. A large cake sits on the table.</p>
  <p> Wesley is surprised.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (hugging Wesley)<br>
    Welcome home.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks, Mom.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Wesley a firm handshake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT TWO 14.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quomodo tua Latinitas est?<br>
    (How's your Latin?)</p>
  <p> Wesley thinks for a moment, then responds --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Praestat quam prius. (It's<br>
    better than before.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oppido bonum. (Very good.) Your<br>
    Latin has improved.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles. Troi comes over and gives Wesley a<br>
    kiss on the cheek.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're looking very handsome.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You do that cadet uniform<br>
    justice, Wesley.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bet you drive the girls wild.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks embarrassed. Worf, who's been busy<br>
    serving the cake, offers Wesley a piece. The cake<br>
    looks dark and heavy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: cake)<br>
    Tarvokian pound cake. I made it<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thanks, Worf.</p>
  <p> Wesley takes the plate and his arm falls slightly from<br>
    the weight of it -- the cake literally weighs a pound.<br>
    He takes a bite, reacts to the richness of the cake.<br>
    During the scene, cake is served all around, everyone<br>
    holding their little plates. People start to mingle,<br>
    branching off into small groups...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Wesley -- was our attempt to make<br>
    you uncomfortable effective?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You bet it was. For a second<br>
    there, I thought I was on the<br>
    wrong ship.</p>
  <p> Laughter all around -- the satisfaction of a practical<br>
    joke well-played.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you found the deception<br>
    pleasurable?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well... yeah. It's fun to be<br>
    surprised.</p>
  <p> Data looks intrigued by the idea.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Are you here to work or play,<br>
    Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know you're on vacation.<br>
    You'll probably want to sleep<br>
    late, and go to the holodeck.<br>
    But if you'd like to help out, we<br>
    could use an extra hand in<br>
    preparing for the Phoenix Cluster<br>
    survey.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks charged by the idea.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That'd be great, sir.</p>

  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    After you're settled, come down<br>
    to engineering. We'll get you<br>
    started.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> As the party continues...</p>
  <p>12A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> On Beverly and Troi, conversing at the far end of the<br>
    table. Beverly is looking at Troi with an intrigued<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What kind of game?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come by my quarters, and I'll<br>
    show it to you...</p>

  <p>12B INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Wesley ENTER the corridor and walk<br>
    together...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have you found the Academy<br>
    challenging, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    After the Enterprise, I thought<br>
    it would be a breeze... but<br>
    there's a lot more to learn<br>
    besides starship operations.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How was your first year?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Although I did extremely well<br>
    scholastically, my lack of Human<br>
    understanding often created<br>
    social obstacles.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Like what?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/3/91 - ACT TWO 16A.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I particularly recall a<br>
    phenomenon called practical<br>
    jokes, several of which I fell<br>
    victim to.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Tell me about it. My first week<br>
    there, a guy named Adam Martoni<br>
    reprogrammed the sonic shower to<br>
    cover me with mud. It took me a<br>
    while, but I got him back pretty<br>
    good...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I also found social gatherings<br>
    difficult. There was one event,<br>
    an Academy tradition, something<br>
    called the Sadie Hawkins Dance.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah... they still hold it every<br>
    year.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was a notably awkward<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Don't worry, Data... I can't<br>
    dance either.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Really? Your mother is quite an<br>
    expert. She recently taught me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah, I know. &quot;The Dancing<br>
    Doctor.&quot; She tried to teach me.<br>
    I just don't seem to have the<br>
    knack.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would be happy to give you<br>
    lessons while you are here on<br>
    vacation. I have created a<br>
    comprehensive seventeen part<br>
    course with some interesting<br>
    holographic dancing partners.<br>
    Several members of the crew have<br>
    become quite proficient...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just make sure we keep enough<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No problem. I'll compress the<br>

  <p> Wesley works the console. Geordi looks satisfied,<br>
    moves off to another part of engineering.</p>

  <p> Robin ENTERS, carrying some small equipment. As she<br>
    crosses the room, she notices Wesley...</p>

  <p> looking frustrated, stuck on some sort of problem.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to himself, re:<br>
    console)<br>
    Now why won't these register... ?</p>
  <p> ROBIN (O.S.)<br>
    You might try calibrating them<br>
    manually.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks up, sees Robin standing over him. He's<br>
    surprised by her presence -- and her beauty -- but<br>
    maintains his cool.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    The detectors. They tend to get<br>
    temperamental. Try calibrating<br>
    them by hand.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Are you kidding? It's gotta be<br>
    done by the computer.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    No, it doesn't. Here...</p>
  <p> Robin leans over and enters some commands into the<br>
    console. After a beat, she looks satisfied.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This subroutine will let you do<br>
    it from the panel...</p>
  <p> She demonstrates by rapidly tapping two buttons on<br>
    Wesley's panel. Wesley watches with interest.</p>

    Law Seventeen -- When all else<br>
    fails, do it yourself.</p>
  <p> Wesley thinks a beat -- &quot;What the hell?&quot; He starts<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's working...</p>
  <p> He turns to Robin, amazed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Sure.</p>
  <p> Robin turns to go...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm Wesley, by the way... Wesley<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> Robin turns to him.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (matter of factly)<br>
    I know. Just came back from the<br>
    Academy.</p>

  <p> They shake hands. There's an electrifying moment when<br>
    they touch -- an instant attraction between them. The<br>
    handshake goes on just for a little too long...</p>

    Hi.</p>

  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (re: console)<br>
    Your neutrinos are drifting.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What? Oh!</p>
  <p> Wesley rushes to the console to make some quick<br>
    adjustments. Robin can't suppress a laugh at the<br>
    sight. Wesley glances up at her, embarrassed... but<br>
    gives in to the humor of the moment. As they exchange<br>
    a smile...</p>
  <p>16A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Still a busy environment, with various supernumeraries<br>
    tending to their work. Data ENTERS and goes to<br>
    Geordi, who is at a science station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A conflict has started between<br>
    the planetary evolution team and<br>
    the stellar physicists. Both<br>
    wish to use the thermal imaging<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... tell them to flip a coin.<br>
    They've got to cooperate on this<br>

  <p> Wesley and Robin together in Geordi's office, plugging<br>
    isolinear chips into an opened control panel. They've<br>

  <p> ROBIN<br>
    My own personal laws. When I<br>
    learn something essential, I make<br>
    up a law about it. That way, I<br>
    never forget.</p>

  <p> Wesley's not sure he likes the sound of this.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>

    That was some prank you pulled on<br>
    Adam Martoni in the physics lab.<br>
    I just want to know how you got<br>

  <p> Wesley can hardly believe she actually knows about<br>

  <p> ROBIN<br>

    Come on, just one game. Try it<br>
    on for size...</p>
  <p> She moves close to Wesley, raises the game toward his<br>
    head, starts to hook it around his ear... Wesley<br>
    gently pulls away, uneasy about the advance. Beverly<br>
    backs off. This is getting awkward. Wesley doesn't<br>
    understand why Beverly's so pushy about the game. He<br>
    pulls a civilian shirt out of the closet.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    We could hook it up to a<br>

    Okay... I've loaded the<br>

  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Let's see what happens...</p>
  <p> Robin types in a command at the console. The game<br>
    sends out TWO TINY LASERS (the effects seen in the<br>

    looks like a psychotropic<br>
    reaction.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Are you saying you think the<br>
    game's addictive?</p>
  <p> Wesley throws her a dead serious look. He works the<br>

  <p> A beat as Wesley decides on the right approach...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There's a game going around...<br>
    something Commander Riker brought<br>
    back from Risa. A little device<br>
    that hooks around the ear...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I've seen it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I did some preliminary tests on<br>
    the game. What I found leads me<br>
    to believe it may have harmful<br>
    side effects. Specifically sir --<br>
    I think it's psychotropically<br>
    addictive.</p>
  <p> Picard considers the revelation. But has his doubts.</p>

    chair... reaches for something behind his desk... and<br>
    reveals the game. He puts on the headset, pulls the<br>
    arm extension in front of his eyes...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>38 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p>38A POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A view of Ten Forward, with the game overlay visible.<br>
    Hundreds of discs and cones crowd the playing grid...<br>
    large numbers of discs dropping into cones all at<br>
    once...</p>
  <p>38B REVEAL SCENE</p>
  <p> O'Brien is the one playing the game. Standing near<br>
    Robin's table, he half turns to Robin, absorbed in the<br>
    game.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Robin)<br>
    Have you tried this?</p>
  <p> Robin eyes the game, leery.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (lying)<br>
    I've tried it, thanks. It's<br>
    great.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN wanders away. Robin watches as he sits down<br>
    and continues to play...</p>
  <p> WESLEY (o.s.)<br>
    Robin...</p>
  <p> Robin jumps, mildly startled. Wesley sits down.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (low)<br>
    Where have you been? Everyone's<br>
    been after me to play.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Me too. I was stopped twice in<br>
    the corridor.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>38B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY (cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I spoke with Captain Picard.<br>
    He's going to look into it.</p>
  <p> They glance around Ten Forward -- almost everyone<br>
    there is playing.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    I hope he makes a shipwide<br>
    announcement or something...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is starting to give me the<br>
    creeps.</p>
  <p> A WOMAN stops at their table.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Did you forget your games?</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (to woman)<br>
    We left them in our quarters.</p>
  <p> The woman looks dubious.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Well then... you can use mine.</p>
  <p> The woman offers the game.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    No thanks...</p>
  <p> The woman sits down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>38B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (stern)<br>
    She said no thanks.</p>
  <p> The woman backs off, eyebrows raised, and walks away.<br>
    Wesley and Robin exchange a look -- this is getting<br>
    more bizarre by the second.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's something else bothering<br>
    me about all this -- if the game<br>
    is addictive... there's only one<br>
    person on the ship we can be sure<br>
    wouldn't be affected by it...</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Right. And he just happened to<br>
    get injured at the same time this<br>
    game was brought on board.</p>
  <p> A beat as they consider the implications.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I think we should take a look at<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> OFF their concern...</p>
  <p>39 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Robin is peering out from around a corner in sickbay,<br>
    trying to look inconspicuous. She's checking to see<br>
    what the nurse is up to.</p>
  <p>40 ROBIN'S POV</p>
  <p> of a NURSE standing in another part of sickbay -- he's<br>
    wearing the game on his head, completely absorbed in<br>
    playing it, oblivious to anything else.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT FOUR 38A.</p>
  <p>40A RESUME</p>
  <p> Robin watches a beat, then ducks back around the<br>
    corner to where Data is laid out on a bio-bed, his<br>
    head panel open, a diagnostic viewscreen nearby.<br>
    Wesley is in the middle of examining the android with<br>
    a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (low)<br>
    The nurse is still playing the<br>
    game.</p>
  <p> Wesley is confounded by Data's condition.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (re: Data)<br>
    I don't know what to make of<br>
    this. There's brain activity...<br>
    all his systems seem to be<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    How can that be? He's<br>
    unconscious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>40A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There might be a signal breach<br>
    somewhere... between his brain<br>
    and his body. Let's map his<br>
    nervous system... see if we can<br>
    isolate a weak link...</p>
  <p> Wesley presses a command into the tricorder... then<br>
    begins to move the wand carefully over Data's body.<br>
    Up his legs... down his arms...</p>
  <p> Robin watches with fascination, but is nervous about<br>
    being discovered. She listens for sounds and glances<br>
    anxiously over her shoulder. Wesley waves the wand<br>
    over Data's neck...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Still nothing...<br>
    (finds something)<br>
    Here.</p>
  <p> He stops the wand at a spot on Data's head.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The signal stops here. Below his<br>
    cognitive processor.<br>
    (reads tricorder)<br>
    There's some kind of damage...<br>
    almost undetectable...<br>
    (indicates viewscreen)<br>
    Turn on the viewer.</p>
  <p> Robin goes to the viewscreen and works the console.<br>
    Wesley makes a modification to the tricorder, then<br>
    holds the wand steady over Data's head.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (re: viewscreen)<br>
    Wesley, look.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/30/91 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>41 VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It shows a microscopic view of a complex network of<br>
    positronic FIBERS -- some of which are clearly and<br>
    cleanly cut.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It looks like some of his<br>
    positronic links have been<br>
    severed.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    The cuts are very precise... see<br>
    how clean the edges are?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Computer, increase magnification,<br>
    factor four.</p>
  <p> The image ENLARGES -- the fiber cuts are indeed razorneat.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Only two people on board know<br>
    enough about Data to have done<br>
    something like this. Commander<br>
    La Forge... and my mother.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Why would one of them do this to<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Maybe there's more going on here<br>
    than we thought. Someone could<br>
    be trying to use the game -- for<br>
    some purpose other than<br>
    pleasure...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/30/91 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    If that's the case... Data would<br>
    have been a threat to that<br>
    plan... but with him out of the<br>
    way, everybody else could become<br>
    addicted.</p>
  <p> They eye each other, worried as they realize the<br>
    possible scope of the situation.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And everybody has. Except us.</p>
  <p> And as they feel the weight of that burden...</p>
  <p>42 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Coming to a stop near the Phoenix Cluster.</p>
  <p>43 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf and Troi at their stations.<br>
    Supernumeraries as needed. Beverly and Geordi are<br>
    also present.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We've reached the designated<br>
    coordinates, Captain. There is<br>
    a ship bearing three-two-seven<br>
    mark one-five-two on an intercept<br>
    course.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Advise them of our status, Mister<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to his senior staff. Our crew has never<br>
    looked more capable -- there is nothing different or<br>
    unusual about their behavior.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go replicate what you need. See<br>
    that the devices are properly<br>
    distributed.</p>
  <p> Everyone nods in acknowledgment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; an<br>
    afterthought)<br>
    And don't forget Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> A nod from Beverly. The group heads for the<br>
    turbolift. Picard turns toward the viewscreen. OFF<br>
    his neutral expression...</p>
  <p>44 INT. BEVERLY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The doors open -- Beverly and Worf ENTER, each<br>
    carrying several of the games.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wesley?</p>
  <p> They venture further into the room.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wesley?</p>
  <p> Wesley calls out, his voice distant.</p>
  <p> WESLEY (o.s.)<br>
    In here, Mom.</p>
  <p> They look toward the adjoining guest room, then head<br>
    for the doors, quickly, with intent...</p>
  <p>45 INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Beverly and Worf ENTER, stop at what they see...</p>
  <p>46 INCLUDE WESLEY AND ROBIN</p>
  <p> sitting on the bed, both wearing the game on their<br>
    heads. They look engrossed in the game... letting out<br>
    tiny gasps of pleasure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly and Worf watch for a moment... then exchange a<br>
    satisfied look. They turn and EXIT.</p>
  <p> A few beats go by. Wesley and Robin gradually come<br>
    out of the charade -- they remove the game headsets,<br>
    looking alert as ever.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (re: games)<br>
    It worked.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Better keep the mock-ups with us.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We can't trust anyone now. Not<br>
    even the captain.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    I'm supposed to be on duty in<br>
    engineering. I've gotta get back<br>
    before Commander La Forge<br>
    suspects something.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    When you get there, start<br>
    accessing the codes for the<br>
    security tracking system.<br>
    There's something I want to<br>
    try...</p>
  <p> Wesley moves to a nearby desktop computer and starts<br>
    to work. Robin stands, mock-up game in hand.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Wesley. Don't forget Law Ninety-One...</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at her.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Always watch your back.</p>
  <p> Wesley nods, appreciative.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You too.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Robin exits. Wesley turns back to the computer -- and<br>
    begins to quickly work. OFF his look of<br>
    determination...</p>

  <p>49 ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An alien woman appears -- it's Etana, the same woman<br>
    from the Teaser. She studies the Enterprise crew.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise has been secured.<br>
    We await your further<br>

  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>50 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous action. Picard and the bridge crew still<br>
    looking at Etana on the viewscreen. In the<br>
    background, Geordi and Troi ENTER, each carrying<br>
    several of the games. They stop and watch the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> Etana sizes up our crew. The soft and sensual woman<br>
    we saw in the Teaser is different here -- her eyes<br>
    reveal a mean intelligence... her speech is<br>
    clipped... expression hard.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    The expansion will proceed as<br>
    follows...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker meets her gaze. There is no acknowledgement of<br>
    the intimacy they once shared. Our entire crew is<br>
    ready to support Etana in any way they can. In<br>
    essence, they have become agents of her will.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Pilot a shuttlecraft to these<br>
    coordinates...</p>
  <p> She punches the coordinates into a panel.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You will rendezvous with the<br>
    Starship Endeavor. Resume<br>
    distribution of the device aboard<br>
    that vessel.</p>
  <p> Riker nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Commander La Forge and Counselor<br>
    Troi... take a shuttle to<br>
    Starbase Sixty-seven. Distribute<br>
    the device to all starships<br>
    currently docked there.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Troi nod.</p>

  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We also have an opportunity to<br>
    introduce the game to Starfleet<br>
    Academy.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Excellent. See to it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Ktarians commend your<br>
    efforts, Picard. When the<br>
    expansion is complete... you and<br>
    your crew will be rewarded.</p>
  <p> As Etana eyes the remaining crew...</p>
  <p>50A INT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS</p>
  <p> Wesley on the move, mock-up game in hand. He passes<br>
    a crewperson, who glances at him. Wesley keeps a<br>
    straight face, not stopping for a second...</p>
  <p> Wesley rounds a corner and approaches a group of<br>
    crewpeople engaged in a hushed conversation. He<br>
    passes them quietly and with no eye contact, trying<br>
    not to arouse suspicion...</p>
  <p> He comes to turbolift doors and touches a button. A<br>
    tense beat, then the doors open...</p>
  <p>50B INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS. Two crewpeople are already in the<br>
    lift. Wesley stands between them, trying to appear<br>
    like nothing is out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to turbolift)<br>
    Deck thirty-six.</p>
  <p> The turbolift starts MOVING. A beat of silence.<br>
    Wesley stands cool and composed. But he can't help<br>
    but glimpse at the crewpeople to see what they're<br>
    doing...</p>
  <p> One of them is looking right at Wesley. Expression<br>
    neutral, eyes searching Wesley's face, he nods a<br>
    slight greeting. Wesley nods in return, then looks<br>
    straight ahead again...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FIVE 46A.</p>
  <p>50B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Both crewpeople start to scrutinize Wesley... they<br>
    look down at his mock-up game, as if to make sure he<br>
    has one. The tension in the room climbs a notch.<br>
    This is the longest turbolift ride of Wesley's life...</p>
  <p> Finally, the doors open and Wesley promptly EXITS.</p>
  <p>50C INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Wesley walks off, breathing a sigh of relief...</p>
  <p>51 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Robin is at a work station. Various N.D.s in<br>
    background. Wesley ENTERS, looking harried but<br>
    determined. He goes straight to a console and sits<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Robin)<br>
    I think we're gonna be okay.<br>
    I've just got one more thing to<br>
    do...</p>
  <p> Robin sits next to him at a parallel console. Wesley<br>
    is so involved in the work that he doesn't look up at<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Help me compile the forcefield<br>
    overrides...</p>
  <p> Robin watches as Wesley enters a few commands.<br>
    Information comes up on the console.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I created a site to site<br>
    transporter program. If things<br>
    get difficult, this'll keep us<br>
    one step ahead...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did you get a chance to access<br>
    the security tracking codes?</p>
  <p> A beat as Wesley works. Robin does not answer, and<br>
    makes no effort to help him -- rather, she just sits<br>
    there, watching him. Slowly, Wesley starts to realize<br>
    that she's not doing anything... and he looks up at<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Robin... ?</p>
  <p> She smiles... but the smile doesn't quite reach her<br>
    eyes. And in one terrifying instant, it's clear:<br>
    Robin is not herself. Her eyes shift ever-so-slightly<br>
    from Wesley's face to a region just behind him...</p>
  <p> Wesley turns. Riker and Worf are standing right<br>
    behind him. He leaps up, turns to Robin -- she's<br>
    holding out the game.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    It's your turn, Wesley. Play the<br>
    game.</p>
  <p> Panicked, Wesley makes a run for it. Riker and Worf<br>
    chase after him. Wesley races across the room...<br>
    past the pool table... and makes a sharp turn for the<br>
    nearest exit...</p>
  <p>52 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> Wesley MATERIALIZES. He leaps down off the stage and<br>
    races out the door...</p>
  <p>54 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Wesley EXITS the transporter room and stops -- tears<br>
    off his communicator, removes the front of it and<br>
    tampers with the inside. Tossing the communicator to<br>
    the floor, he takes off running down the corridor...</p>
  <p>55 INT. BRIDGE</p>

  <p>56 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley moving cautiously along. He stops at an<br>
    intersection between two corridors and kneels down.<br>
    He reaches into his pocket and reveals a TYPE-ONE<br>
    PHASER (a smaller version of the regular phasers) and<br>
    presses a command into it. He lays the phaser on the<br>
    arm rail, aiming it at the intersection.... then<br>
    activates it. The phaser sends out a series of weak,<br>
    sporadic BURSTS -- the tiny beams absorbed harmlessly<br>
    into the wall.</p>
  <p>57 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Aye sir.</p>
  <p>58 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (Same one as before.) Wesley is gone. The phaser is<br>
    still sending out the bursts when a FORCEFIELD appears<br>
    at the intersection. The bursts start hitting the<br>
    forcefield.</p>
  <p>59 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to the console.</p>

  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've got him, Captain -- section<br>
    twenty-five. It looks like he's<br>
    trying to break through the<br>
    forcefield with a phaser.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Security to deck six, section<br>
    twenty-five.</p>
  <p>60 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Wesley running along. He stops and peers around a<br>
    corner. TWO SECURITY GUARDS are running toward him<br>
    through the connecting corridor. Wesley ducks back<br>
    around the corner. Waits. Looks again and the coast<br>
    is clear. He makes a run into the corridor...</p>
  <p>61 OMITTED</p>
  <p>62 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two security guards we've just seen arrive at the<br>
    scene -- but Wesley is nowhere to be found. Just the<br>
    phaser lying on the arm rail, sending out its tiny<br>
    beams.</p>
  <p>63 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, and Robin at a console, trying to track<br>
    Wesley. N.D.s working in background.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where the hell is he?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am attempting to isolate him<br>
    with thermal sensors...</p>
  <p> Worf works the console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Narrow the scan field. Go deck<br>
    by deck if you have to...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unfortunately, he knows our<br>
    procedures... he will avoid<br>
    corridors and public areas...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A tense beat of working the controls. Then Worf<br>
    reacts to the console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am reading an unidentified heat<br>
    source on deck seven, section<br>
    twenty-three...<br>
    (points)<br>
    There...</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf exchange a knowing look. Then they<br>
    take off running...</p>
  <p>64 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Wesley is crawling horizontally along the narrow<br>
    passageway, deep in the bowels of the ship. Suddenly,<br>
    an access hatch opens behind him -- it's Worf. The<br>
    Klingon starts after him. It's a tense chase down the<br>
    crawlway until...</p>
  <p> Wesley makes it to another hatch -- the doors open and<br>
    Wesley jumps through the doorway into...</p>
  <p>64A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> in a part of the Jefferies Tube where Wesley can stand<br>
    up (as seen in &quot;Disaster&quot;). He immediately presses a<br>
    button next to the doors, and as they start to slide<br>
    shut --</p>
  <p> Worf's hand stops it from the other side. The doors<br>
    start to open, Worf's Klingon strength forcing them<br>
    apart. Wesley frantically keeps pushing the &quot;close&quot;<br>
    button. Worf reaches in with both hands, using all<br>
    his might and it's working, he's getting the doors to<br>
    open all the way. Wesley rushes across to another set<br>
    of doors. He hits the unlocking code into a panel...<br>
    the doors open and...</p>
  <p> Riker on the other side. Wesley leaps back, startled.<br>
    Riker quickly steps through the hatch toward Wesley.<br>
    Wesley wavers between Riker and Worf, panicked about<br>
    what to do next, but there is no escape. He's<br>
    trapped.</p>
  <p>65 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open and Riker and Worf ENTER,<br>
    Wesley in tow between them -- they've each got an arm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 8/27/91 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Wesley struggles against their iron grips, to no<br>
    avail.</p>
  <p> Wesley is dragged to the command area, where Picard<br>
    and Beverly step over to him. Wesley can hardly<br>
    believe his eyes. Here's the Enterprise crew, all<br>
    looking and speaking like their normal selves -- but<br>
    their actions utterly alien. It's a chilling<br>
    predicament -- and Wesley never stops resisting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You gave us quite a chase, Mister<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley is silent, glaring. Worf puts a little extra<br>
    squeeze on Wesley's arm. Wesley reacts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Doctor Crusher...</p>
  <p> Beverly walks over and hands Picard the game. Wesley<br>
    eyes it with utter dread. Picard moves it toward<br>
    Wesley's head. Wesley struggles like crazy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hold him steady.</p>
  <p> Worf steadies Wesley's head with a massive hand.<br>
    Beverly looks at Wesley with a soft expression, tries<br>
    to comfort him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's okay, Wesley. It doesn't<br>
    hurt. You'll like it. I promise<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Picard hooks the game securely around Wesley's ear.<br>
    He pulls the arm extension in front of Wesley's eyes.<br>
    Wesley shuts his eyes tight, refusing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a command)<br>
    His eyes.</p>
  <p> Riker reaches in and forces Wesley's eyes open.<br>
    Picard activates the game, which comes alive with tiny<br>
    lights.</p>
  <p>66 CLOSE ON WESLEY'S EYES (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The game sends out two thin LASERS -- and they make<br>
    contact with Wesley's pupils. Wesley tenses up. The<br>
    lasers vanish. Wesley's struggling starts to<br>
    subside...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>67 WESLEY'S POV - THE GAME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A view of the bridge -- with the familiar GAME OVERLAY<br>
    superimposed on top. The playing field has a cone and<br>
    a disc coasting across it. Picard and Beverly are<br>
    visible beyond the overlay, looking straight at us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The disc starts to skitter about, but it misses the<br>
    cone. Wesley's strength is sapping...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> The disc moves faster, closer to hitting the cone.<br>
    Then finally, the disc drops right into the cone.</p>
  <p> Wesley's body tenses up. Then he relaxes, letting out<br>
    a small gasp of pleasure. He slumps a little,<br>
    succumbing to the game. It looks hopeless.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's it, Wesley... just let<br>
    yourself go...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the bridge lights GO OUT. Darkness.<br>
    Confusion.</p>
  <p>68 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> on the turbolift doors opening. A tall FIGURE steps out<br>
    of the brightly-lit interior -- a dramatic silhouette<br>
    against the light. As the doors close, the figure<br>
    raises up an arm, aiming a device toward the room,<br>
    causing --</p>
  <p> A series of BRIGHT WHITE FLASHES OF LIGHT. The effect<br>
    is blinding and erratic, like a flashbulb going off in<br>
    the darkness. With each flash of light, we see faces,<br>
    reactions:</p>
  <p> -- FLASH! Picard and Beverly react, wide-eyed and<br>
    stunned, the light blinding them.</p>
  <p> -- FLASH! FLASH! Worf and Riker fall back, hands in<br>
    front of their eyes, the light causing them pain.</p>
  <p> -- FLASH! Troi and Geordi stumble back, dazzled by<br>
    the light.</p>
  <p> A beat of darkness, then...</p>
  <p> DATA (o.s.)<br>
    Computer, resume normal<br>
    illumination.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - 8/23/91 - ACT FIVE 53A.</p>
  <p>69 ANGLE - DATA</p>
  <p> As the bridge lights come BACK ON. Data is standing<br>
    in the turbolift doorway, holding a palm beacon that's<br>
    been modified to send out flashes of light.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He has the beacon trained and ready to fire again, if<br>
    necessary. But the bridge crew looks dazed, like<br>
    they're coming out of a deep sleep. Some are rubbing<br>
    their eyes... others simply regaining their balance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Mister Worf, you will find a<br>
    small alien ship off the<br>
    starboard bow. Secure it with a<br>
    tractor beam and raise our<br>
    shields.</p>
  <p> Worf is at first uncertain, looks to Picard. Picard<br>
    nods, okay. Worf works the console.</p>

    Are you all right, Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard considers, head still foggy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think so...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, we are being hailed by<br>
    the alien vessel.</p>

  <p>71A INTERCUT: VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Etana appears on the viewscreen, her outrage barely<br>
    contained.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Picard, explain yourself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Game&quot; - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>71A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The explanation is simple -- your<br>
    attempt to capture this ship has<br>
    failed.</p>
  <p> ETANA<br>
    Release us immediately. Or we<br>
    will open fire.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tactical analysis, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Their weapons capability is<br>
    substantially inferior to ours.<br>
    They are not a threat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Get her off the screen.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen returns to a starfield.</p>

    I can't believe what we were<br>
    about to do...</p>
  <p> A beat... Beverly moves to Wesley -- there's a<br>
    relieved look between them. Riker approaches Data,<br>
    surprised...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data... we deactivated you...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I managed to reconnect his<br>
    positronic matrix.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Wesley's subsequent diversions<br>
    gave me adequate time to modify<br>
    the palm beacon...<br>
    (re: beacon)<br>
    The optical burst patterns we<br>
    programmed were successful in<br>
    counteracting the addictive<br>
    effects of the game.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    And the rest of the crew?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have programmed the main<br>
    computer to transmit the same<br>
    optical pulse to all display<br>
    screens, work stations and<br>
    terminals throughout the ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That'll reach almost everyone.<br>
    Send out medical teams to treat<br>
    the rest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Beverly joins Data and they head for the turbolift.<br>
    Picard takes the command position, regaining his<br>
    composure, but still rattled by the whole experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll take the alien vessel to<br>

  <p> Wesley standing at the bed, dressed in Academy<br>

  <p> ROBIN<br>
    I never saw you wear these.<br>
    Afraid someone might see your<br>
    birthmark?</p>
  <p> He takes the shorts form her.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Who started that birthmark rumor,<br>
    anyway?</p>
  <p> She shrugs innocently; he pulls her close and they<br>
    kiss. A moment, and they part gently. It's clear<br>
    their relationship has matured over the past few days.</p>
  <p> ROBIN<br>
    Wish you didn't have to go.</p>
