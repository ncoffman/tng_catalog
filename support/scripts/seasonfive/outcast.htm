  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45614.6.<br>
    We have been contacted by an<br>
    androgynous race called the J'naii<br>
    to investigate the disappearance<br>
    of a shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, WORF, DATA, SUPERNUMERARIES, and several<br>
    J'naii, including SOREN and KRITE. The J'naii are a<br>
    genderless species; Soren and Krite, like the others,<br>
    possess no demonstrable sexual characteristics. All<br>
    the J'naii look remarkably alike: strikingly<br>
    attractive, with lithe, slim bodies and chiseled,<br>
    delicate features. Soren is near Riker; Krite at an<br>
    aft station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are approaching the designated<br>
    coordinates, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>2A ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It shows the starfield -- no sign of a shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Long-range scan, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data enters commands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors find no evidence of the<br>
    shuttle anywhere within the star<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    It couldn't have travelled outside<br>
    the system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, reconfigure for a<br>
    high-resolution sweep with a<br>
    radius of one million kilometers.<br>
    Look for possible debris.</p>
  <p> Data works controls once more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scan shows no debris within<br>
    that radius.</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    I don't understand it. A<br>
    shuttle doesn't simply vanish.</p>
  <p> Soren turns to Riker, frustrated.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    There has to be an explanation...</p>
  <p> But before Riker can answer--</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I am detecting an unusual<br>
    reading... It appears to be a<br>
    neutrino emission with no visible<br>
    source.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explanation?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have none. I recommend we<br>
    launch a probe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Soren peers intently at the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The probe is launched.</p>
  <p> A probe shoots off from the Enterprise and is clearly<br>
    visible on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The probe is transmitting<br>
    information within normal<br>
    parameters. Sensors do not show<br>
    evidence of any unusual phenomenon<br>
    --</p>
  <p> Suddenly the probe vanishes from the screen, and from<br>
    Data's instruments.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The probe is no longer<br>
    transmitting.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What happened? Where did it go?</p>

  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a blue-green planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. The<br>
    sudden disappearance of our probe<br>
    suggests that we may have found<br>
    the first instance of what is<br>
    called null space -- an anomaly<br>
    which until now had been only<br>
    theoretical. Commander Riker has<br>
    been working around the clock with<br>
    a team of J'naii specialists to<br>
    formalize this hypothesis.</p>
  <p>4 INT. J'NAII CIVIC CHAMBER - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Soren, Krite, NOOR (head of government), and<br>
    other J'naii leaders are gathered to discuss the<br>
    situation. The room is not huge -- just larger than<br>
    the observation lounge.</p>
  <p> Soren and Riker are standing near a monitor in the<br>
    wall, upon which an Okudagram illustrates the gases<br>
    and vapors that swirl into the formation of a star.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    During the creation of a star<br>
    system, when clouds of<br>
    interstellar dust and gas<br>
    coalesce... turbulent regions of<br>
    magnetic and gravitational fields<br>
    may develop.</p>
  <p> The monitor reflects this, showing dense fields of<br>
    disturbance.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    If certain conditions occur,<br>
    these fields can condense into<br>
    abnormal pockets of space.</p>
  <p> Soren turns and glances at Riker. He and Soren have<br>
    been working together on this project, and there's<br>
    already an easy familiarity between them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We think your system contains one<br>
    of these null pockets.</p>
  <p> Riker pushes controls and the monitor shows a star<br>
    system in which one section, or &quot;pocket&quot; is<br>
    significantly different from the space surrounding it.<br>
    Riker points to it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we're right, this pocket would<br>
    absorb electromagnetic energy from<br>
    anything that entered it...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Like a shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Or a probe. Making them<br>
    powerless.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    But outside the pocket, all energy<br>
    is bent around it -- making it<br>
    naturally cloaked. That's why<br>
    we can't see it, and sensors don't<br>
    read it.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Is the shuttle still there?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We think so. The ship probably<br>
    couldn't sustain its power...<br>
    but other than that it wouldn't<br>
    be damaged.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Since our shuttles carry<br>
    plestorene-based backup systems,<br>
    we think life support would<br>
    sustain for as long as ten days.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Then perhaps our crew has<br>
    survived...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can send one of our shuttles<br>
    into the null space -- but its<br>
    energy output would be absorbed<br>
    as well. Our chief engineer is<br>
    working on a way to maintain the<br>
    power reserves long enough to<br>
    rescue your crew.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Commander... we're grateful for<br>
    your help.<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Whatever resources we can provide<br>
    are yours.</p>
  <p> Noor heads for the door, followed by the others.<br>
    Riker turns to Soren.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I've been thinking... when the<br>
    time comes, I'd like to pilot the<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p> Riker is a little surprised at this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a Starfleet craft...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I can't ask you to put yourself<br>
    in danger to rescue our crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can't pilot a shuttle you're<br>
    not familiar with.</p>
  <p> Soren hesitates, realizing the truth of what he's<br>
    saying... but not wanting to give up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I happen to be a good pilot...</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I happen to be a good pilot, too.<br>
    I also know my way around<br>
    Starfleet shuttles. So... what<br>
    if we team up?</p>
  <p> Soren considers, looks at him, smiles.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    When can we go over your shuttle<br>
    flight operations?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right now.</p>
  <p> And he gestures Soren out of the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 INT. SHUTTLE BAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Soren walk around the shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a short-range craft... with<br>
    two twelve-hundred fifty<br>
    millicochrane warp engines...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Looks like microfusion<br>
    thrusters...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Armament?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Usually none. But it's been<br>
    fitted with two type-four phaser<br>
    emitters... we'll use them to<br>
    chart the null space.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Chart it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander La Forge wants to get<br>
    an idea of how big this pocket<br>
    is. He thinks the rate of energy<br>
    absorption will be linked to its<br>
    size.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm not sure how we go about<br>
    mapping something we can't see...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's where the emitters come<br>
    in. We'll shoot a series of<br>
    photon pulses into the pocket and<br>
    chart the points where they<br>
    disappear. We should be able to<br>
    plot a fairly complete outline<br>
    that way.</p>
  <p> Soren gives him a look and smiles, nodding. She turns<br>
    to ENTER the shuttle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Let's take a look at the controls.</p>
  <p> Soren enters the shuttlecraft, followed by Riker.</p>
  <p>5A INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> They sit at the controls.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe later we can try a flight<br>
    simulation, but first let's do<br>
    a systems review.<br>
    (taps controls)<br>
    I'll walk you through it...</p>
  <p> Soren gives him a quick look, puts hands on the<br>
    controls.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5B CLOSE ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The monitor on the panel jumps to life, scrolling<br>
    through a systems review.</p>
  <p>5C BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Propulsion system... transfer<br>
    conduits... where's the schematic<br>
    of the reactor assembly? Oh,<br>
    there it is... engine nacelles...</p>
  <p> She looks over at Riker, who is watching her go through<br>
    the review at top speed.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    There's nothing here that's<br>
    unfamiliar.</p>
  <p> She continues manipulating the console like a pro.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Navigational deflector...<br>
    redundant graviton polarity source<br>
    generators...</p>
  <p> Riker is watching in admiration.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're handling those controls<br>
    like you grew up in a shuttle...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I did. My parents were pilots.<br>
    I started flying with them before<br>
    I could walk. And as soon as I<br>
    was old enough, I entered flight<br>
    school. Krite was my instructor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He had a good student.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>5C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Soren looks at him, coolly amused.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    &quot;He?&quot; Commander, there are no<br>
    &quot;he's&quot; or &quot;she's&quot; in a species<br>
    without gender.</p>
  <p> Riker grins, throws up his hands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay. For two days I've been<br>
    trying to construct sentences<br>
    without personal pronouns. I give<br>
    up... what should I say? &quot;It?&quot;<br>
    To us, that's almost rude.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We use a pronoun which is neutral.<br>
    But it doesn't really have a<br>
    translation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (good-naturedly)<br>
    Then I'll just have to muddle<br>
    through... so be tolerant if a<br>
    stray &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; slips by,<br>
    okay?</p>
  <p> Soren smiles at him and they work for a beat more.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Well, if that's the systems<br>
    review, I don't see any problems<br>
    here. What's next?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles in admiration for this quick study.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lunch.</p>
  <p> Soren looks at him. Smiles.</p>
  <p>6<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    7</p>
  <p>8 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker at a table with Soren. In the background, beyond<br>
    them, is a couple in intimate conversation, heads<br>
    close. We will see them later. A waiter has just set<br>
    bowls of soup on Riker's table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Soren peers down at it, puzzled.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Split pea soup. My father's<br>
    recipe. I had it programmed into<br>
    the replicators.</p>
  <p> Soren takes a spoonful, touches her tongue to it.<br>
    (NOTE: From this point on, for the sake of<br>
    convenience, feminine pronouns will be used in<br>
    reference to Soren.) She tastes it, is not displeased,<br>
    takes a little more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Unusual... but I think I like<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's very healthy. Helps keep<br>
    you warm on a cold Alaskan night.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We prefer to stay warm by sleeping<br>
    with a friend.</p>
  <p> The statement is startling in its casualness. Riker<br>
    looks at her, taken aback.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (explaining)<br>
    Not to mate... just to sleep<br>
    together. For warmth.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds better than pea soup.</p>
  <p> Soren gives him a direct, penetrating look.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We are puzzling to you, aren't<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A little. It's hard to grasp the<br>
    idea of having no gender...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    It's just as hard for us to<br>
    understand the strange division<br>
    you have in your species... males<br>
    and females.</p>
  <p> Riker can't help but smile. Soren's gaze drifts to<br>
    the couple in the corner, who are being openly<br>
    affectionate with each other.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You... are male.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, not certain where this is leading.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Tell me... about males. What is<br>
    it that makes you different from<br>
    females?</p>
  <p> A tall order. Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Snips and snails and puppy dog's<br>
    tails...</p>
  <p> She stares at him, dumbfounded.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You have a dog's tail?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    That's an old nursery rhyme.<br>
    Girls are made of sugar and spice.<br>
    Boys are made of snips and<br>
    snails...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    That makes it sound better to be<br>
    female.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's an old fashioned way of<br>
    looking at the sexes. Not to say<br>
    that there aren't real<br>
    differences. Physically, men tend<br>
    to be bigger... stronger in the<br>
    upper body. We have different<br>
    sexual organs. Men don't bear<br>
    young...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What about... feelings? Emotional<br>
    attitudes? Are they different?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... most people think so.<br>
    But that's the kind of question<br>
    that might take an hour or two<br>
    to answer.</p>
  <p> She smiles and glances again at the affectionate<br>
    couple.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me ask you...<br>
    (struggling a bit)<br>
    What's it like... on a planet where<br>
    the people have no gender?</p>
  <p> She gives him a curious look.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm afraid I don't understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... who leads when you dance?<br>
    If you dance...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We do... and... whoever's taller<br>
    leads.</p>
  <p> She gives him a direct look, and he can't tell whether<br>
    she's kidding or not. He keeps it in a playful mode.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Without the &quot;battle of the<br>
    sexes&quot;... you probably don't<br>
    have as many arguments...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE 14A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> She regards him with amusement.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Just because we don't have gender<br>
    doesn't mean we don't have<br>
    conflict. We're very strong-<br>
    minded... we love a good fight.</p>
  <p> He eyes her, taken by her wit and her forthrightness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds like there aren't that<br>
    many differences between your<br>
    species and mine...</p>
  <p> She smiles, looking directly at him.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Maybe not.</p>
  <p> Soren hesitates only briefly before the next question,<br>
    which she asks casually.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What kind of woman do you find<br>
    attractive?</p>
  <p> Riker gives her a slight look, wondering where this<br>
    questioning is coming from.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I like a woman who's intelligent<br>
    and sure of herself... somebody<br>
    I can talk to and get something<br>
    back.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But the most important thing of<br>
    all -- she has to laugh at my<br>
    jokes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Soren does.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    And is that the kind of woman all<br>
    human males prefer?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all. Some men like quiet,<br>
    demure women... others prefer a<br>
    lot of energy... some respond only<br>
    to physical attractiveness...<br>
    others couldn't care less. There<br>
    aren't any rules.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him. Her eyes flicker over to the<br>
    couple, who exchange a brief kiss.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You make it sound very complex.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Believe me -- it is.</p>
  <p> Soren looks into his eyes. A subtle but unmistakable<br>
    change comes over her... the look is seductive. Her<br>
    voice takes on a sensuous tone.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Perhaps it is that complexity...<br>
    which makes differences in the<br>
    sexes... so interesting.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him, leaning forward slightly, waiting<br>
    for a response. Riker is taken aback. He stares at<br>
    her, not sure how to respond. He is rescued from the<br>
    dilemma by the arrival of Krite, who approaches the<br>
    table from behind Soren.</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    Good evening, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good evening.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Please take my place, Krite. I<br>
    have to be going.</p>
  <p> Riker looks up at her; she has undergone another<br>
    transformation. Gone is the seductiveness, the<br>
    alluring voice, the pliant body language. She is erect<br>
    and formal -- a typical J'naii.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE 15A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Thank you for going over the<br>
    flight protocols, Commander. It's<br>
    been very helpful.</p>
  <p> And she walks away, Riker looking after her, puzzled.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLE AND ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the shuttle moves away from the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45616.3.<br>
    Commander Riker and the J'naii<br>
    pilot have set out on a mission<br>
    to chart the null space pocket.<br>
    If they are successful, we can<br>
    then proceed with a rescue<br>
    attempt.</p>
  <p>11 INT. SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Soren.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I've illuminated the delta-four<br>
    grid map. We can start there and<br>
    then expand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stand by forward phaser array...</p>
  <p> Riker hits controls, and he and Soren begin their<br>
    collaborative charting effort.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A thin stream shoots from the shuttle but quickly runs<br>
    into an &quot;invisible wall&quot; -- the stream disappearing<br>
    into the null space.</p>
  <p>13 INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> as Soren measures.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    The pulse vanished at delta<br>
    four-point-two by point three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Firing second burst...</p>

  <p>13AA ANGLE - MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which shows a gradually lengthening curved line -- the<br>
    outline of the null space pocket.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's working. I think we'll be<br>
    able to give Commander La Forge<br>
    the information he needs.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Delta four-point-five by point<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm initiating computer task<br>
    hand-off...</p>
  <p>13AB RIKER AND SOREN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as they settle into an easy rhythm, a give-and-take<br>
    that becomes unspoken as they anticipate and respond<br>
    to each other's moves. Presently, Soren glances over<br>
    at him.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Commander... tell me about your<br>
    sexual organs.</p>
  <p> Riker gives her a startled look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ahhh...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Is that an uncomfortable subject<br>
    for Humans?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... but it doesn't tend to be<br>
    a topic of casual<br>
    conversation...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm interested in your mating<br>
    practices... what is involved<br>
    when there are two sexes.</p>
  <p> Riker takes refuge in a moment of distraction from<br>
    their mapping project.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Correcting course... zero-two-one<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>13AB CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The graph is gradually taking fuller shape, delineating<br>
    the outline of the null pocket. Soren looks at him...<br>
    he looks over at her, sees her watching, waiting for<br>
    his response.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Mating.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right. Well, it's pretty simple.<br>
    The men inseminate the women and<br>
    the women carry the babies.</p>
  <p> Soren absorbs this.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Our fetuses are incubated in<br>
    fibrous husks which both parents<br>
    inseminate. From what we know<br>
    of other species, our method is<br>
    less risky and less painful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    And less enjoyable...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (hearing him)<br>
    Less enjoyable?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (trying to explain)<br>
    For Humans... the sexual act<br>
    brings a closeness... an<br>
    intimacy... it's a very<br>
    pleasurable experience...<br>
    (beat: on the other<br>
    hand)<br>
    Inseminating a husk...</p>
  <p> Soren laughs at this.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    That's just the last step. Mating<br>
    is a long ritual for us... full<br>
    of variety and invention... I<br>
    assure you -- it's extremely<br>
    pleasurable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 18A.</p>
  <p>13AB CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker turns his attention to the controls once more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm picking up a neutrino<br>
    emission... from within the null<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    That may be coming from our<br>
    shuttle. I'll note these<br>
    coordinates.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>13AB CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> They work for a moment in silence, then --</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I wonder...</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    If a Human and a J'naii would be<br>
    sexually compatible...</p>
  <p> A provocative question. Riker doesn't know where it's<br>
    coming from.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Of course, it would never be<br>
    permitted.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    The idea of gender... it's<br>
    offensive to my people. You see,<br>
    long ago we had two sexes, as<br>
    you do. But we evolved... into<br>
    a higher form.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't mean to sound insulting...<br>
    but on my planet we've been taught<br>
    that gender is...<br>
    (struggling for the<br>
    least offensive word)<br>
    ...primitive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (good naturedly)<br>
    Primitive.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Less evolved...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe so. But sometimes there's<br>
    a lot to be said for an experience<br>
    that's... primitive.</p>
  <p> She gives him a look... then turns to her controls.</p>

    Adjusting course... zero-two-nine<br>
    mark zero.</p>
  <p>13A EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it turns slightly to port, the port engine nacelle<br>
    suddenly disappears, the re-appears. The shuttle<br>
    starts to go into a spin.</p>
  <p>13B INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> where things are suddenly going crazy. The shuttle<br>
    rolls wildly as Soren and Riker try to regain control.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The port engine is down...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Reducing power in the starboard<br>
    nacelle...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not enough... I have to<br>
    activate the maneuvering thrusters<br>
    to correct the spin...</p>
  <p> He keys controls.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Thrusters aren't responding...</p>
  <p> She gets out of her seat and moves toward a wall panel.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'll try to reroute the firing<br>
    sequence...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Inertial dampers are failing...<br>
    hang on!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT TWO 19B.</p>
  <p>13B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker fights to correct the spin. But a wild roll<br>
    flips Soren and topples her onto the deck.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise to shuttle... do you<br>
    read me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Affirmative... we've lost an<br>
    engine...</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    We'll try to get a tractor beam<br>
    on you...</p>
  <p> Riker is being pinned back in his seat by the G forces.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with difficulty)<br>
    The sooner the better...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>13B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> And the shuttle gradually stabilizes. As it comes<br>
    under control...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enterprise, we have an injury.<br>
    Transport Soren directly to<br>
    sickbay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Right away, Commander.</p>
  <p> And on Riker's concern --</p>

  <p>15A EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise at rest.</p>
  <p>16 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly ministers to Soren, who is sitting on a<br>
    bio-bed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's just a mild concussion...<br>
    You're going to be fine.<br>
    (using tricorder)<br>
    This will reduce the inflammation.</p>
  <p> She works for a beat, then --</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Doctor... you are female.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her curiously.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Forgive me... I don't mean to be<br>
    rude... but I'm curious. What<br>
    is it like?</p>
  <p> A question Beverly's rarely had to consider.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 20A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... it's... just the way I<br>
    am. I've never thought about what<br>
    it's like.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What is it that makes you female?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Very specific biological factors.<br>
    Females carry two X chromosomes,<br>
    males carry an X and a Y. Hormone<br>
    levels are distinctly different;<br>
    males produce primarily<br>
    testosterone, while women produce<br>
    estrogen. Our sexual organs are<br>
    very different -- females' are<br>
    geared to bearing and nursing the<br>
    young.</p>
  <p> Soren takes this in for a moment.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I've noticed... that you tend to<br>
    have longer hair... you arrange<br>
    it more elaborately... and you<br>
    apply color to your bodies.</p>
  <p> Beverly is bemused by this objective assessment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Color... ?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You put color on your mouths...<br>
    your eyes... your cheeks... even<br>
    your fingernails. The men don't.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's true...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Why do you decorate yourselves<br>
    like that?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a long-time custom... we're<br>
    used to it...<br>
    (beat -- with a smile)<br>
    ... but I think the real reason<br>
    -- is to attract men.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mmmm-hmmmm...</p>
  <p> Soren ponders this a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO 21A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Then... it's up to women to<br>
    attract the men?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh, believe me, men want to be<br>
    attractive, too -- but they go<br>
    about it differently.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    No color...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No color. They'd rather<br>
    pretend they're not doing<br>
    anything to attract a woman...<br>
    even when it's the most important<br>
    thing on their minds.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    It's very confusing.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are women considered superior?<br>
    Or are men?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Neither. In the past, women were<br>
    often considered weak and<br>
    inferior. But that hasn't been<br>
    true for a long time.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Do you... enjoy being a woman?</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks, decides, smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. As a matter of fact, I enjoy<br>
    it a lot.</p>
  <p> Soren smiles at her, and at this point Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will... your co-pilot is fine.<br>
    The injury was minor.</p>
  <p> Riker's smile toward Soren is relieved.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm glad to hear it.</p>
  <p> Riker approaches her, and during the next, Beverly<br>
    picks up on the attitude... subtle but unmistakeable...<br>
    that Soren is very attracted to Riker.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I'm afraid you're not rid of me<br>
    yet, Commander. I'll be able to<br>
    complete the mission.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you should hear my new<br>
    regulation: no more gymnastics<br>
    in the shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> She smiles. He looks at her, a more serious tone<br>
    in his voice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm glad you're all right...</p>
  <p> She hears the concern in his voice, flushes slightly,<br>
    looks down. She seems unaccountably nervous, and<br>
    Beverly takes note.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What happened... why did the<br>
    shuttle go into a spin?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Apparently, the port engine nacelle<br>
    nicked one of the protrusions from<br>
    the null pocket, and shut down.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Are we still on schedule for the<br>
    rescue attempt?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That depends on how you're doing.</p>
  <p> She slips off the bed.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm fine. We should check out<br>
    the port engine --</p>
  <p> Riker puts his hands on her shoulders to restrain her.<br>
    She stops instantly, as though the touch has<br>
    electrified her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whoa... let's get the doctor's<br>
    opinion first...</p>
  <p> He takes his hands off her shoulders and she takes<br>
    a breath, turns to Beverly.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Doctor... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't see a problem. But if<br>
    you have any symptoms... headache,<br>
    dizziness -- come back.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You have my word.</p>
  <p> They EXIT, and Beverly looks after them, wondering if<br>
    she saw something -- something personal -- happening<br>
    between them.</p>
  <p>17 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A poker game in session -- Data, Worf, Troi, Beverly.<br>
    Troi is shuffling.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All right... this round, the game<br>
    is -- Federation Day.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts with distaste.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The Federation was founded in<br>
    Twenty-one-sixty-one. So twos,<br>
    sixes, and aces are wild.</p>
  <p> Worf looks almost queasy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is a woman's game.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (unbothered)<br>
    Oh? Why is that?</p>
  <p> She proceeds to deal.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    All those wild cards... they<br>
    support a weak hand. A man's game<br>
    has no wild cards.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let me get this straight. Are<br>
    you saying it's a woman's game<br>
    because -- because women are weak<br>
    and need more help?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (why else?)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with a sigh)<br>
    And just this afternoon I was<br>
    insisting to one of the J'naii<br>
    that those attitudes were nothing<br>

    Why, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They just do.</p>
  <p> She gives him a penetrating look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are all alike. No males.<br>
    No females.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure we're just as strange<br>
    to them.</p>
  <p> Worf gives her an incredulous look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, one of them seems to be<br>
    overcoming the differences... at<br>
    least with regard to one of us...</p>
  <p> They stare at her, uncomprehending.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you saying, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I could be wrong... but I get the<br>
    definite impression that Soren...<br>
    is attracted to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> They all take this in. Worf is certain in his<br>
    pronouncement.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A human and a J'naii?<br>
    Impossible.</p>

    Good question. Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf grunts and buries his nose in his cards.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    With all the wild cards, it is<br>
    difficult to know exactly what<br>

  <p>18A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The portable transporter array<br>
    is in. Once we get into null<br>
    space, we'll have to initialize<br>
    it before we transport the J'naii<br>
    crew to this shuttle. But there<br>
    should still be enough power left<br>
    to beam all of us back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Is the buffer field generator<br>
    installed?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not yet. Geordi figures it'll<br>
    be ready to go at oh-eight-hundred<br>
    hours tomorrow.<br>
    (to Soren)<br>
    We should adjust the engine<br>
    balance before that. Can you<br>
    access the starboard thrust<br>
    manifold?</p>
  <p> She squeezes her self next to Riker, sitting on the<br>
    floor with her back to the wall. They are pressed<br>
    close. She now accesses the thrust manifold.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    There...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay, calibrate it to arc at<br>
    six-point-three while I optimize<br>
    the plasma flow.</p>
  <p> They work together for a beat. Riker is concentrating<br>
    intensely on his work. Soren sneaks a glance over at<br>
    him. Makes a decision. Takes a breath.</p>

    Commander...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mmmmm?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'd like... to tell you something.<br>
    Something that's not easy to say.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (still involved in work)<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I... find you attractive.</p>
  <p> Riker stops his work, turns to look at her.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm taking a terrible risk,<br>
    telling you that. It means...<br>
    revealing something to you...<br>
    Something that, if it were known<br>
    on my planet, would be very<br>
    dangerous for me.</p>
  <p> He stares at her, not knowing what she means.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>18A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> As Soren reveals her story, she is at first halting,<br>
    uncertain, and timorous.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Occasionally, among my people,<br>
    a few are born who are --<br>
    different. Who are throwbacks<br>
    to the era when we all had gender.<br>
    Some are born with strong<br>
    inclinations toward maleness...<br>
    and some have urges to be female.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am one of the latter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have to admit... I got the<br>
    feeling you were different.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I was hoping you would. But in<br>
    front of Krite and the others,<br>
    I must be careful not to reveal<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    On our world these feelings are<br>
    forbidden. Those who are<br>
    discovered are shamed and<br>
    ridiculed. Only by undergoing<br>
    psychotectic therapy and having<br>
    all elements of gender eliminated<br>
    can they become accepted into<br>
    society again.</p>
  <p> Riker is dismayed by her story.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Those of us who have these<br>
    urges... live secret, guarded<br>
    lives.<br>

  <p> SOREN (cont'd)<br>
    We seek each other out... always<br>
    hiding, always terrified of being<br>
    discovered...</p>
  <p> Riker is a bit overwhelmed by all this. His mind<br>
    struggles to accommodate the bizarre story she is<br>
    telling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long have you known you were<br>
    like this?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I've known I was different all<br>
    my life. But I didn't understand<br>
    how or why until I was older.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And when you realized... what<br>
    then?</p>
  <p> Soren pauses a moment, searching to provide a context<br>
    for the answer.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I remember when I was very<br>
    young... before I understood what<br>
    I was... there was a rumor in<br>
    my school that one of the students<br>
    preferred a gender... in that<br>
    case, male. The children started<br>
    making fun of him... every day,<br>
    they got more cruel... They could<br>
    tell he was afraid... and that<br>
    seemed to encourage them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He appeared in class one morning,<br>
    bleeding... his clothes ripped.<br>
    He said he'd fallen down.</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, trying to regain composure in the<br>
    face of this ugly memory.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Of course the school authorities<br>
    heard about it... They took him<br>
    away and gave him psychotectic<br>
    treatments.<br>

    (beat)<br>
    When he came back... he stood in<br>
    front of the whole school and told<br>
    us how happy he was now that he<br>
    had been cured.</p>
  <p> There is a long silence.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    After that... I knew how dangerous<br>
    it was to be different. And as<br>
    I got older, and realized what<br>
    I was, I was terrified.<br>
    (a breath)<br>
    I've lived with that fear ever<br>
    since.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you have... relationships...<br>
    with others?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Yes -- with those who have<br>
    discovered they are male.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at her, mind reeling. She lifts a hand<br>
    and touches his face, gently.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I've had to live a life of<br>
    pretense and lies. With you...<br>
    I can be honest.</p>
  <p> He starts to speak, but she covers his lips with her<br>
    fingers.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Don't say anything. Just... think<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> They look into each other's eyes for a moment more,<br>
    then Soren wriggles out and moves out of the shuttle.<br>
    Riker stares after her, a myriad thoughts and emotions<br>
    overwhelming him.</p>

  <p>19 INT. SHUTTLE BAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Soren are preparing for the mission launch.<br>
    They are strangely silent, not meeting the other's eye.<br>
    Geordi emerges from the shuttle, where he's made a<br>
    flight check.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, Commander, everything checks<br>
    out. The energy buffer is<br>
    installed and functioning. I<br>
    estimate it should reduce the<br>
    power drain to your systems by<br>
    about forty percent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any guess how long we'll have?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let just say... you don't want<br>
    to waste any time once you get<br>
    in there.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks from Riker to Soren.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Soren)<br>
    You'll have to give him continuous<br>
    readouts on energy consumption.<br>
    I can't even predict if the drain<br>
    will be at a constant rate.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> She casts a glance at Riker, who isn't looking at her.<br>
    Geordi looks from one to the other.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then... that's it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Now Riker and Soren exchange glances. He gestures her<br>
    into the shuttle. She nods and ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll monitor you as far as I can,<br>
    Commander. But once you get into<br>
    that pocket -- you're on your own.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Since we don't know the condition<br>
    of the shuttle crew, I'll beam<br>
    us all directly to sickbay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll notify Doctor Crusher to be<br>

  <p> Riker ENTERS the shuttle, closes the doors. Geordi<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The null space must be affecting<br>
    the annular confinement beam...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We used ten megajoules with that<br>
    attempt. We're down to<br>
    thirty-four percent of reserves.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can give it one more try. More<br>
    than that and we won't have enough<br>
    power to get ourselves out of<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Grimly, he keys controls again. The EFFECT shimmers<br>
    in, fades, reappears, pulses -- and, finally, holds,<br>
    as the two unconscious J'naii MATERIALIZE on the rear<br>
    deck of the shuttle. Soren immediately gets to her<br>
    feet and goes to them, inspects them.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    They need medical attention<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> Riker rises and joins the huddle of figures.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay. Stand by to transport to<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> He turns to a panel on the wall and enters coordinates.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Here we go...</p>
  <p> The EFFECT shimmers in again, DEMATERIALIZING the group<br>
    of four. There is an instant of clear screen, as<br>
    though they've made it -- but then they SHIMMER back<br>
    into view, then pulse a few more times, as though the<br>
    transporter is giving its all. But finally, the group<br>
    MATERIALIZES onto the rear deck of the shuttle, intact<br>

    woods)<br>
    Perhaps you would like to inspect<br>
    some of them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, I would. I've always been<br>
    interested in exobotany.</p>
  <p> She rises, maintaining the formal posture.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Please. Let me take you on a<br>
    tour.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Thank you. It's very kind of you.</p>
  <p> They move off toward the woods. Camera pans back<br>
    toward the civic chamber. Standing in the darkness,<br>
    watching them, is Krite.</p>
  <p>30 EXT. PLANET - INTO THE WOODS</p>
  <p> Riker and Soren walk along a path. She points out<br>
    various trees and shrubs.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    One of my favorites is this<br>
    menellen tree. The leaves first<br>
    turn pure white, and then blue<br>
    when the weather gets cold...</p>
  <p> They move on, deeper into the woods.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    This is called a falla bush...<br>
    it produces a fragrant flower on<br>
    only one day of the year...</p>
  <p> She moves on... but Riker reaches out and takes her<br>
    arm, turns her back to him. They stand like that for<br>
    an instant, staring at each other, shrouded in the<br>
    cover of the woods, moonlight catching and reflecting<br>
    in Soren's eyes. She parts her lips... moves toward<br>
    him without even realizing she's doing it... and then<br>
    they are locked in one another's arms, kissing deeply,<br>
    as though it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 45620.4.<br>
    We remain in orbit of J'naii,<br>
    charting the null pocket. We hope<br>
    that a detailed map of the anomaly<br>
    will prevent the loss of other<br>
    ships.</p>
  <p>32 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi sits on her couch, inspecting the contents of a<br>
    box which rests on the floor. There are several<br>
    artifacts spread out on a coffee table -- small<br>
    figures, a doll, pictures, little books, etc. Troi<br>
    holds a larger book on her lap and is leafing through<br>
    the pages. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker ENTERS. She looks up, smiles<br>
    at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Will.</p>
  <p> He comes to her, sits nearby, where he can see what<br>
    she's looking at.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's all this?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wonderful things... my mother sent<br>
    me a box that belonged to one of<br>
    my father's ancestors. It had<br>
    been stored on Earth years ago<br>
    and just recently turned up.</p>
  <p> Riker picks up one of the pictures.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know who these people are?</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    No. A few of the pictures are<br>
    marked with names... but most of<br>
    them aren't. I look at all these<br>
    faces... and wonder who they<br>
    are... if they might be related<br>
    to me...</p>
  <p> Riker picks up a small, worn, stuffed animal and turns<br>
    it in his hands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (playful)<br>
    This one looks like you...</p>
  <p> She smiles at him... there's a long beat between them.<br>
    Then--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna... I've got something on my<br>
    mind... and I had to see you...</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Has something happened?</p>
  <p> He looks up at her, nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've met someone... someone who's<br>
    becoming important to me...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Soren...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> There is a moment as the two friends gaze at each<br>
    other, the look speaking of trust and affection that<br>
    is deep-seated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're my friend... so it seemed<br>
    like...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm not sure. It just seemed<br>
    right to tell you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm glad you did.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing will change between us,<br>
    will it?</p>
  <p> She smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course it will. All<br>
    relationships are constantly<br>
    changing.</p>
  <p> She reaches out and touches his cheek.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But we will always be friends.<br>
    Maybe even better friends.<br>
    You're part of my life, and I'm<br>
    part of yours. That much will<br>
    always be true.</p>
  <p> He leans forward and they kiss, sweetly and tenderly.</p>

  <p>33 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Riker and Soren work with Geordi; Krite and another<br>
    J'naii are in the background, monitoring a console.<br>
    Riker and Soren are in their formal mode.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Turns out the null pocket is even<br>
    more irregular than we expected,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe its configuration is<br>
    shifting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think so... the<br>
    measurements you took are holding.<br>
    It just has more projections than<br>
    we thought. It's going to take<br>
    longer than we planned to get it<br>
    mapped.</p>
  <p> No response from Riker or Soren, with whom the delay is<br>
    just fine.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm headed for the shuttle bay.<br>
    We're fitting another shuttle to<br>
    help in the survey.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and EXITS. Riker and Soren do not look<br>
    at each other.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (casually)<br>
    Have you made plans for dinner<br>
    this evening?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I have some paperwork to do...<br>
    I thought I'd start on it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd like to discuss some of our<br>
    suggestions for regulating travel<br>
    around the null space. Maybe we<br>
    could have an early dinner... so<br>
    you could still get your work done<br>
    afterwards.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'd like that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nineteen hundred hours?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    That would be fine.</p>
  <p> An innocuous enough exchange... they keep on working.</p>

  <p>34A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still in orbit.</p>
  <p>35 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker walks the corridor toward Soren's quarters, finds<br>
    the right one, presses the panel. The door opens to<br>
    reveal Krite. Riker is surprised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hello. I'm here to see Soren...</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We had an appointment.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    To discuss plans for regulating<br>
    the --</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    I don't think so, Commander.</p>

    Excuse me?</p>

    We know what you're doing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (worried now)<br>
    Where's Soren?</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    And we're going to make sure it<br>
    doesn't happen again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Answer me -- where is Soren?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> A little smile from Krite.</p>
  <p> KRITE<br>
    Gone. In custody. And there's<br>
    nothing you can do about it.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at him, mind racing, trying to figure what<br>
    to do. He makes a decision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The hell there isn't.</p>
  <p> And he turns and strides down the corridor.</p>
  <p>36 INT. PLANET CIVIC CHAMBER</p>
  <p> Soren sits before a panel of &quot;judges,&quot; including Noor.<br>
    A gallery of citizens fills the room.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    You are aware of the charges<br>
    against you?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Do you intend to dispute them?</p>
  <p> Soren does not answer.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Well? What is your response?</p>
  <p> Suddenly the doors to the chamber slam open and Riker<br>
    ENTERS, striding toward the judges' table amid the<br>
    hubbub of the startled onlookers. He marches right<br>
    toward Noor. Soren stares at him, astonished.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you in charge here?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Commander Riker -- these<br>
    proceedings are closed to anyone<br>
    but --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I just opened them.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Sir, this is a private matter.<br>
    We are grateful for your recent<br>
    help, but that gives you no right<br>
    to interfere with our personal<br>
    concerns --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I want you to know what really<br>
    happened. It's all my fault.<br>
    I was attracted to Soren. I<br>
    pursued... I insisted. I didn't<br>
    understand your ways until Soren<br>
    told me. And rejected me.<br>
    Nothing happened between us.</p>
  <p> He pauses, looking from one to the other for an<br>
    indication of their response.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I ask your forgiveness. I<br>
    behaved... inappropriately.</p>
  <p> Noor takes this in. Ponders it. Turns to Soren.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Is this true?</p>
  <p> Soren hesitates... looks at Riker. Then she rises,<br>
    moves toward Noor.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Soren --</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I am tired of lies.</p>
  <p> She turns to Noor, head held high.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I am female. I was born that way.<br>
    I have had those feelings...<br>
    those longings... all my life.</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, desperately hoping to communicate<br>
    to her countrymen.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    It is not unnatural. I am not<br>
    sick because I feel this way.<br>
    I do not need to be helped, and<br>
    I do not need to be cured. What<br>
    I do need -- what all of those<br>
    like me need -- is your<br>
    understanding and your compassion.</p>
  <p> She walks along the line of her accusers.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    We do not injure you in any way.<br>
    And yet we are scorned, and<br>
    attacked. And all because we are<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> A hush has fallen over the room as everyone listens<br>
    to her impassioned speech.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What we do is no different from<br>
    what you do. We talk and laugh...<br>
    we complain about work and we<br>
    wonder about growing old... we<br>
    talk about our families, and we<br>
    worry about the future...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We cry with each other when things<br>
    seem hopeless.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All the loving things that you<br>
    do with each other... that's what<br>
    we do. And for that, we are<br>
    called misfits, and deviants...<br>
    and criminals.</p>
  <p> She looks around at her countrymen, head high,<br>
    unafraid, angry.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    What right do you have to punish<br>
    us? What right do you have to<br>
    change us? What makes you think<br>
    you can dictate how people love<br>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>37 INT. CIVIC CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous action. Soren has just make her<br>
    declaration. Riker stares at her, knowing she has<br>
    fully incriminated herself. Noor is regarding Soren<br>
    with impersonal objectivity.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    I congratulate you, Soren. Your<br>
    decision to admit your perversion<br>
    makes it much more likely that<br>
    we can help you.</p>
  <p> He lifts his hand to gesture toward guards.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, wait... you don't have to do<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> Noor turns to him, mildly irritated.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me take her away. She can<br>
    come with me, we'll give her<br>
    asylum on the Enterprise. You'll<br>
    never have to see her again.</p>
  <p> Noor hesitates, as though considering the suggestion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That would solve the problem,<br>
    wouldn't it? You'd be rid of<br>
    her... she couldn't influence<br>
    anyone else...</p>
  <p> Noor smiles gently at Riker, as though at a small child<br>
    who just doesn't get it.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Commander, after Soren's diatribe,<br>
    you must think we are a cruel,<br>
    repressive people. Nothing could<br>
    be further from the truth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm just trying to find a solution<br>
    that would satisfy everyone --</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    In fact, we are a remarkably free<br>
    and open society. Our people have<br>
    rights and liberties which give<br>
    them a great deal of<br>
    self-determination. We are, by<br>
    all measurements, an enlightened<br>
    race.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then how is it... that Soren has<br>
    no choice about her sexual<br>
    orientation?</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    We are concerned about our<br>
    citizens. We take our obligations<br>
    to them seriously. Soren is<br>
    sick... and sick people need to<br>
    get well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did it ever occur to you she<br>
    might prefer to stay the way she<br>
    is?</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    You don't understand. We have<br>
    a very high success rate in<br>
    treating deviants like this. And<br>
    without exception -- they have<br>
    become happier people after their<br>
    treatment. And grateful... that<br>
    we care enough to cure them.<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    She is --</p>
  <p> But Noor turns away from Riker and gestures to a nearby<br>
    functionary, who moves to Soren and takes her arm.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    Take her to quarters. Treatment<br>
    will begin tomorrow.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't do this --</p>
  <p> Riker moves toward her, but several of the J'naii step<br>
    between him and Soren, and a crowd envelops her,<br>
    whirling her away from him. The last he sees of her<br>
    is her head, twisting back to look for him, her eyes<br>
    wide and frightened, like a rabbit's as the eagle<br>
    swoops down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Soren --</p>
  <p> Riker starts to plow through the group around him, but<br>
    Noor steps directly in front of him and fastens him<br>
    with a stern glance.</p>
  <p> NOOR<br>
    No more, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker sees Soren disappear through a far door, knows<br>
    it's futile to go after her now. Glaring at Noor --</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I could talk to Noor. Perhaps<br>
    there's a way to work this out<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    Sir, their minds are set. They<br>

  <p> Picard takes this in, considers it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I'm not sure there's much<br>
    we can do.</p>
  <p> Riker looks up at him. He speaks quietly, but with<br>
    resolve.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There has to be.</p>
  <p> He struggles to frame this in a way that Picard can<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My relationship with Soren isn't<br>

    The door CHIMES again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who is it?</p>
  <p> WORF'S VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Riker conceals the small pack of equipment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Worf ENTERS, carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, I have the plan for<br>
    deploying warning buoys around<br>
    the null space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine. Just leave it, I'll look<br>
    at it later.</p>
  <p> Riker has to work to control his impatience -- a fact<br>
    which Worf notices.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> But Worf doesn't turn to go. Riker stares at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you. You're dismissed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander... I am aware of what<br>
    transpired on the planet's<br>
    surface...</p>
  <p> Wary, Riker doesn't respond.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you by any chance considering<br>
    an... unannounced visit?</p>
  <p> Again, Riker is silent, but this gives Worf the answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will go with you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (starting to protest)<br>
    Lieutenant --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... you are my commanding<br>
    officer... and if you order me<br>
    to stay on board, I will obey.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I ask you not to give that<br>
    order. A warrior does not let<br>
    a friend face danger alone.</p>
  <p> Touched by Worf's steadfast loyalty, Riker nods.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I suggest we change clothing<br>
    first.</p>
  <p>41 EXT. J'NAII PLANET - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The courtyard/garden. Riker, now dressed in N.D. dark<br>
    clothing, is positioned in the woods, watching toward<br>
    the civic center. The building is lit, and there is<br>
    activity inside. Worf, also in dark clothing, comes up<br>
    to him through the trees.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The meeting is ending. I<br>
    think they will bring her out of<br>
    the building soon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay. They'll probably come<br>
    down that path... we can take<br>
    cover there --<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    -- behind those rocks.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She'll be under guard... no<br>
    telling how many...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will handle the guards. You<br>
    take her to cover.</p>
  <p> Riker notices something in the building.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something's happening...</p>
  <p> He lifts the binoculars, peers through them.</p>
  <p>41AA<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    41AB</p>
  <p>41AC CIVIC CENTER - HIS POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Through a futuristic grid, an opening to the civic<br>
    chamber shows the J'naii moving about in the room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're leaving.</p>
  <p>41A ANGLE - ON WORF AND RIKER</p>
  <p> as they emerge from the shadow of the trees. They<br>
    creep across the courtyard, moving from shadow to<br>
    shadow, toward the civic chamber. Several J'naii<br>
    EXIT into the courtyard. Riker and Worf take cover.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>41B ON THE J'NAII</p>
  <p> Two J'naii walk by their position... neither one is<br>
    Soren.</p>
  <p>41C RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> glance at each other. Riker points toward the doors<br>
    -- opening once more.</p>
  <p>41D THREE J'NAII</p>
  <p> EXIT and walk off in another direction.</p>
  <p>41E RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> exchange another frustrated glance. Then Worf nods<br>
    toward the doors, seeing another group.</p>
  <p>42 ANGLE - HALLWAY LEADING TO CIVIC CHAMBER</p>
  <p> as Soren and two guards EXIT the structure, heading<br>
    down the path toward the courtyard.</p>
  <p>42A ANGLE - RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> exchange a look and crouch down. As the trio<br>
    approaches, Riker and Worf step out in front of them.<br>
    The guards react, surprised. Riker smiles at them,<br>
    ingenuously.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could you excuse us? I have to<br>
    talk to her...</p>
  <p> But the guards go into attack mode, throwing punches<br>
    toward Riker. He blocks the blows and then Worf steps<br>
    in and engages the two of them. Riker takes Soren's<br>
    arm and pulls her toward the woods.</p>
  <p>43 ON RIKER AND SOREN</p>
  <p> hurrying into the woods.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Wait...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't worry... we'll be out of<br>
    here in a minute...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He is intent on getting to their prearranged meeting<br>
    place. They are pushing through bushes, shrubs, etc.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Will, please...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're almost there...</p>
  <p> Finally they move into a clearing, where they are<br>
    sheltered by trees and bushes, but moonlight<br>
    illuminates the clearing. Riker stops, turns to her.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    You can't do this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I won't let them hurt you. You'll<br>
    be safe on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> She turns away from him, silent. Puzzled, he takes<br>
    a step toward her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Soren...</p>
  <p> She turns back, looking at him with curious detachment.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm so sorry... it's my fault you<br>
    got involved in all this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's going to be all right...<br>
    everything's going to be fine...</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    No, it's not.</p>
  <p> He stares at her, not comprehending her strange<br>
    attitude.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What are you talking about?</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    It was all a mistake. I should<br>
    have realized it from the<br>
    beginning...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    That I was sick. I had these<br>
    terrible urges... that's why I<br>
    reached out to you... but it was<br>
    wrong. I see that now.</p>
  <p> And now he understands. She's already been treated.<br>
    He is too late.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    (a little shake of her<br>
    head)<br>
    I don't understand how I could<br>
    have done... what I did.</p>
  <p> He grasps for anything...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher<br>
    could treat you... bring you<br>
    back... to the way you were<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> She smiles sadly at him, truly sorry for his pain, but<br>
    disconnected from it.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    Why would I want that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Soren... I love you.</p>
  <p> She looks at him, not even vague regret in her eyes...<br>
    as though looking at someone she knows she once loved,<br>
    but can't remember why.</p>
  <p> SOREN<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> And she turns and melts into the darkness. Riker<br>
    stares after her.</p>
  <p>44 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>45 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Data, and N.D. personnel. Picard is forward,<br>
    talking to Data and the Conn Officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long to the Phelan system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At warp six, fifty-three hours,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outcast&quot; - 1/2/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open and close, pulling Picard's<br>
    look. Riker EXITS the turbolift and starts down the<br>
    ramp.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander... ?</p>
  <p> Riker is impassive, his face revealing nothing, but<br>
    his voice is tight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> They hold a look for a moment. Riker sits.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet has just sent a message<br>
    asking us to proceed to the Phelan<br>
    system to negotiate a trade<br>
    agreement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wasn't sure when to tell them<br>
    we'd be underway.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is our business with the J'naii<br>
    finished?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Finished, sir.</p>
  <p> There is another beat, and then Picard turns to the<br>
    Conn Officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Ensign, take us out<br>
    of orbit, set a course for the<br>
    Phelan system. Warp six.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> OFF Riker's reaction...</p>
  <p>46 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> jumps into warp speed and away.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
