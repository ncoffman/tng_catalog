    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45333.3.<br>
    The Enterprise is on its way to<br>
    Penthara Four where a type C<br>
    asteroid has struck an unpopulated<br>
    continent.</p>
  <p>2 INT. GEORDI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> NUMEROUS ENGINEERING CREW are busily working with<br>
    GEORDI and DATA.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The resulting dust cloud could<br>
    very well create a phenomenon not<br>
    unlike the nuclear winters of<br>
    twenty-first-century Earth.<br>
    Commander La Forge has begun work<br>
    on a plan that would counteract<br>
    the devastation.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks over as RIKER ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm afraid the numbers coming in<br>
    are already indicating climatic<br>
    changes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What kind of drop can we expect?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If the Pentharan spheral forecasts<br>
    are correct, ten to twelve degrees<br>
    Celsius within the first ten days.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If it continues like that, their<br>
    entire ecosystem will be shot<br>
    to hell.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And I doubt they're prepared to<br>
    cope with the kind of cold that's<br>
    coming.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keys combadge)<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Would you join me on the bridge,<br>
    please.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (to guys)<br>
    Let me know if those forecast<br>
    numbers change.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data acknowledge as Riker EXITS.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, WORF, AN ENSIGN at theconn, and SUPERNUMERARIES<br>
    at various stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you certain, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There was a space/time<br>
    distortion, sir. And there is<br>
    something back there. We passed<br>
    within three hundred kilometers<br>
    of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A bit close for coincidence.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would a delay of an hour affect<br>
    your plans?</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>4 INT. GEORDI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not unless another asteroid<br>
    decides to pay a call on Penthara,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The odds of that occurring,<br>
    Captain, are extremely unlikely,<br>
    given the time frame.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> as Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Mister Data.<br>
    (to Ensign)<br>
    Prepare to come about, Ensign.<br>
    Let's take a look at Mister Worf's<br>
    distortion.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf's what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Lieutenant's sensors detected<br>
    a temporal distortion, Number One,<br>
    almost directly on our current<br>
    course. There seems to be a small<br>
    object back there that wasn't<br>
    there a few moments ago.</p>
  <p> On Riker and Picard's mutual curiosity...</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> comes out of warp and makes a sweeping turn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The object is fifty kilometers<br>
    ahead, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Full stop, Ensign.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> A view of a tiny multifaceted spacecraft appears.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dimensions, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Approximately five meters in<br>
    length, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lifesigns?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No signs of any kind, sir.<br>
    Sensors are not penetrating its<br>
    hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try hailing it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (pushes a series<br>
    of buttons)<br>
    That's odd.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's odd?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We've received a response, sir,<br>
    but...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (get on with it)<br>
    Yes, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They want you to... &quot;Move over,&quot;<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (looks at Riker and then<br>
    back at Worf)<br>
    Reply that the Enterprise isn't<br>
    going anywhere, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not the Enterprise, Captain. You.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and walks toward Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you trying to...</p>
  <p> Suddenly there's a bright flash where Picard had been<br>
    standing. RASMUSSEN, a kindly-looking human male in<br>
    his late forties, APPEARS. He is wearing a drab,<br>
    nondescript jump suit and a baggy &quot;lab&quot; jacket. He<br>
    carries a small valise.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Excuse me, Captain, but you were<br>
    standing right where I needed to<br>
    be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Rasmussen's the name, sir.<br>
    Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.<br>
    (looking around in<br>
    amazement)<br>
    Ah... this is wonderful.<br>
    Actually, quite a bit larger than<br>
    I thought.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Where I come from, every historian<br>
    knows the bridge of old 1701-D.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And where exactly is it you come<br>
    from?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Why Earth... late twenty-sixth<br>
    century Earth, to be exact. You<br>
    see, I've traveled back nearly<br>
    three hundred years just to find<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Off their reactions we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)</p>
  <p>8 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard sits behind his desk while Rasmussen paces,<br>
    checking things out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly what kind of historian<br>
    are you?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (as he continues to<br>
    pace, picking things<br>
    up, turning them over)<br>
    My focus is on the twenty-second <br>
    through the twenty-fourth centuries,<br>
    early interstellar history.<br>
    (picking up Picard's<br>
    Shakespeare volume)<br>
    You know, it was always believed<br>
    this was on your desk, not here...<br>
    Fascinating.<br>
    (he turns to Picard,<br>
    good naturedly)<br>
    Now don't move it on my account.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can't expect me to believe<br>
    that the layout of my ready room<br>
    is of interest to future<br>
    historians...</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    No less so than your legendary<br>
    modesty, Captain. I wish I could<br>
    describe to you what a thrill it<br>
    is to be here...<br>
    (he stops at the<br>
    painting over Picard's<br>
    couch)<br>
    This is the original, isn't it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You flatter me Professor, but I<br>
    can't help but wonder what could<br>
    possibly have caused you to select<br>
    me as the subject of your study.<br>
    Even in this decade, there are<br>
    far wiser and more experienced<br>
    Humans both in and out of<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I'd love to tell you, Picard.<br>
    I really would. But try and<br>
    imagine what a young Caesar might<br>
    have done differently if someone<br>
    had given him a hint of what lay<br>
    ahead. Or, if Lincoln had been<br>
    coerced into changing his theater<br>
    plans. I truly wish I could be<br>
    more specific on why you were<br>
    selected, but I'm afraid the<br>
    exchange of information will have<br>
    to flow in one direction only.</p>
  <p> As Rasmussen talks, he walks to the door and paces out<br>
    the distance to the window.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    ...four... five... six... seven<br>
    meters. HA! I was right!</p>
  <p> Off Picard's look...</p>
  <p>9 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, BEVERLY, TROI, Data and Geordi.<br>
    Rasmussen is sitting beside Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why now?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right. If you came back to study<br>
    us, to study the captain, why did<br>
    you pick today? Why not a year<br>
    ago... or a year from now?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Oh, I picked the right day<br>
    alright. Just wait, you'll see.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN (cont'd)<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Do you always sit there, on that<br>
    side of the table?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Usually. Why?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (shakes his head and<br>
    smiles)<br>
    It's not important.</p>
  <p> Worf is starting to dislike this man.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tell me, Professor, at what point<br>
    does time travel become a tool<br>
    for historians?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Now, now, Commander. You know<br>
    better than that. I've studied<br>
    a great deal about your century.<br>
    Including the fact that you're<br>
    all quite aware of the dangers<br>
    of anyone altering the past. And<br>
    that's exactly what I'd be doing<br>
    if I were to divulge information<br>
    like that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Telurian plague!</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Telurian plague... was it cured?<br>
    I mean, has it been cured by your<br>
    century? There can't be any harm<br>
    in asking that.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen turns to Picard for help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I realize it will be difficult,<br>
    but we must all keep our questions<br>
    regarding the future to ourselves.<br>
    Professor...</p>
  <p> Rasmussen stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/26/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I'll be preparing questionnaires<br>
    for each of you. Please complete<br>
    them at your convenience. If<br>
    you're concerned about a possible<br>
    breach of security, I'm sure your<br>
    captain can make a<br>
    determination... And, thank you<br>
    in advance for curbing your<br>
    curiosity.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    If I hand my assignment in on<br>
    time, do I get a little glimpse<br>
    into next week's poker game?</p>
  <p> Rasmussen laughs good heartedly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, please show the<br>
    Professor to his quarters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (standing)<br>
    This way, sir.</p>
  <p> Data leads Rasmussen to the door and they EXIT.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What did he mean he picked the<br>
    right day?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know everything I do, Will.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's hard to tell. But he is<br>
    holding something back.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Of course he is. Think of all<br>
    the things he could tell us...<br>
    all the things he'd like to tell<br>
    us...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/26/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    That might be it, I don't know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How can we be sure he's not an<br>
    imposter? God knows we've run<br>
    into enough of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is Human. Our medical scans<br>
    have proved that. Haven't they,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's Human, alright.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And there was a temporal<br>
    distortion back there, correct<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (begrudgingly)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And no one can deny that ship of<br>
    his is unlike anything we've ever<br>
    seen before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The hull is composed of some kind<br>
    of plasticized tritanium mesh.<br>
    Nothing we have on record... at<br>
    least not 'til the present.</p>
  <p> Worf grumbles skeptically.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate your caution, Mister<br>
    Worf. I share it. Have his<br>
    vessel brought into a shuttlebay.<br>
    Place it under guard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I realize this isn't going to<br>
    be an easy visit for some of you.<br>

  <p>9 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Nevertheless, I've reviewed the<br>
    Professor's credentials, and<br>
    they're in order. So, I'd like<br>
    you all to extend him every<br>
    courtesy.</p>

    Including questionnaires.<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> As all stand to leave, we CUT TO...</p>
  <p>10 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Rasmussen and Data. The lift is in motion. Rasmussen<br>
    is inspecting Data like a car enthusiast would a<br>
    vintage Ferrari.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    This is really a thrill, Data.<br>
    Like running across a Redstone<br>
    missile or a Guttenberg bible.<br>
    To think... the Model T of<br>
    androids.</p>
  <p> The lift stops and the doors open. Rasmussen and Data<br>
    EXIT into the corridor.</p>
  <p>11 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Rasmussen and Data head for Rasmussen's quarters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you're referring to the first<br>
    production model automobile of<br>
    the twentieth century, perhaps the<br>
    subsequent Model A might be a more<br>
    apt analogy since I am Noonian<br>
    Soong's revised prototype.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen continues to check Data out as they reach his<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I stand corrected.</p>
  <p> The door opens and they go in...</p>
  <p>12 INT. RASMUSSEN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Rasmussen looks around, disappointed.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there a problem, sir?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I suppose it will have to do, for<br>
    now. I'll get you a list of<br>
    things I'll be needing. You're<br>
    dismissed.</p>
  <p> Data starts to leave. Rasmussen walks to the sink and<br>
    begins to wash his hands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (almost shy)<br>
    Would I be correct, Professor,<br>
    in assuming that you know whether<br>
    or not I am still... alive in<br>
    the twenty-sixth century?</p>
  <p> Rasmussen ignores Data. He finishes washing and holds<br>
    out his hand, treating Data like a men's room<br>
    attendant. After a beat, Data catches on and hands him<br>
    a towel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing his line<br>
    of questioning)<br>
    Since you seemed to know so much<br>
    about Captain Picard and the<br>
    ship... I assumed that you<br>
    would...</p>
  <p> Rasmussen sits at his desk.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (patronizing)<br>
    It would be best if you kept your<br>
    assumptions to yourself, wouldn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I am sorry, sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS and Rasmussen looks after him, again<br>
    fascinated. He sits back, and smiles. Whatever his<br>
    plans, they are clearly going just as he'd hoped.</p>

  <p> Meteorologist HAL MOSELEY's large cluttered office has<br>
    been temporarily transformed into a crisis center.<br>
    NUMEROUS N.D. SCIENTISTS move from one set of monitors<br>
    to another. Picard and Geordi are beside Moseley.<br>
    The snow can be seen through windows. Picard points<br>
    to a map on a monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've located three underground<br>
    pockets of carbon dioxide...<br>
    here, here and here. Our drilling<br>
    phasers can release enough of the<br>
    gas to form an envelope which<br>
    would temporarily hold in the heat<br>
    from the sun.</p>

  <p> MOSELEY<br>
    (laughing at the irony)<br>
    We spend years, decades trying<br>
    to avoid anything that would lead<br>
    to a greenhouse effect and here<br>
    we are about to create one on<br>
    purpose.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Less than twenty percent of your<br>
    normal sunlight is getting through<br>
    that dust, Doctor. If we can hold<br>
    enough heat in with the CO2, it<br>
    should give the planet time to<br>
    mend itself.</p>
  <p> A worried FEMALE SCIENTIST approaches.</p>

    What now?</p>

    New Seattle is reporting a cloud<br>
    depth of twelve kilometers. Two<br>

  <p> Moseley turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> MOSELEY<br>
    We better get started before<br>
    there's nothing left to mend.</p>
  <p> Off their reactions...</p>
  <p>17 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Rasmussen ENTERS holding a small pile of rectangular<br>
    chips and looks around gleefully. He sees Riker,<br>
    Worf, and Beverly at a table and heads over to join<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Look who's here.</p>

    (with enthusiasm, she's<br>
    quite taken with<br>
    Rasmussen)<br>
    Professor, please come join us.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen goes to sit next to Worf, but thinks better<br>
    of it and sits near Beverly.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I hope I'm not intruding.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not at all. You're probably the<br>
    topic of conversation at every<br>
    table in the room.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen shuffles through the chips, finds the three<br>
    appropriate ones, and distributes them to those<br>
    present.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    As I promised, here are your<br>
    assignments. I'm sure they'll<br>
    be painless. Please try to<br>
    complete them by tomorrow.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (peeved)<br>
    Tomorrow!</p>
  <p> Riker makes eye contact with Worf. Tells him to cool<br>
    it. However, he feels almost as put-upon as his<br>
    tactical officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No problem, Professor.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen looks from face to face, fascinated.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    You're all very calm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Do we have reason not to be?</p>

  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    History always records where<br>
    people were, what they were doing,<br>
    when important events took place.<br>
    But it rarely remembers their<br>
    activities -- say, a week before...<br>
    or a day... or even an hour.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you suggesting an important<br>
    event is imminent?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I didn't say that, did I?<br>
    Please... go on doing what you<br>
    were doing, pretend I'm not here.</p>
  <p> They are all a bit uncomfortable, unable to &quot;go on<br>
    doing what they were doing.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (after a long beat)<br>
    How come there's no record of<br>
    other future historians traveling<br>
    back to witness &quot;important<br>
    events?&quot;</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    We're obviously very careful.<br>
    Matter of fact, a colleague and<br>
    I recently paid a call on a<br>
    twenty-second century vessel.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (fascinated)<br>
    They hadn't even perfected<br>
    quarantine fields by then. You<br>
    must have seen surgical masks and<br>
    gloves.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Isn't it fascinating how everyone<br>
    has different interests when it<br>
    comes to history... different<br>
    perspectives on progress.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen opens a small finger ring, looks inside,<br>
    smiles, and closes it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mind if I ask what that is?</p>

  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Just checking the time... No<br>
    problem.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (getting a bit<br>
    frustrated)<br>
    Is something supposed to be<br>
    happening here?</p>
  <p> Rasmussen waves his hand, dismissing the question.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    No, no, nothing.<br>
    (changing the subject)<br>
    What about you, Commander? What<br>
    do you see as the most important<br>
    example of progress over the<br>
    last two hundred years?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (pauses)<br>
    I suppose the warp coil. Before<br>
    we had warp drive, Humans were<br>
    confined to a single sector of<br>
    the galaxy.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Spoken like the consummate<br>
    explorer.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen looks around the room, as if he were waiting<br>
    for something to happen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's going on? You waiting for<br>
    someone?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Phasers!</p>
  <p> Riker and Rasmussen turn to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where?!</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There were no phasers in the 22nd<br>
    century.</p>

  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Ah, you see Doctor? Our Klingon<br>
    friend is a perfect example of<br>
    what I was trying to tell you.<br>
    He views history through the eyes<br>
    of a hunter, a warrior. His<br>
    passion lies in the perfection<br>
    of the tools of violence. How<br>
    delightfully primitive.</p>

  <p> He hands a chip to the engineer, who nods and EXITS as<br>
    Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Ah, Data. Good.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What have you learned about the<br>
    tectonic stability around the<br>
    drilling sites?</p>
  <p> Rasmussen ENTERS, unnoticed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Couldn't be better. Our scans<br>
    were all clear and Moseley says<br>
    there hasn't been so much as a<br>
    quiver in over a century.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Ah, just the two I'm looking for.<br>
    I've brought the forms I'd like<br>
    you to complete.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen hands Geordi and Data a chip each.</p>

    Is that as fast as he can go?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not fast enough for you,<br>

  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    There's very little known about<br>
    Data's efficiency... almost<br>
    nothing about his part in this<br>

    conjecture.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>31 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is running an instrument along A MALE PATIENT's<br>
    injured leg. At another station A BOY is being treated<br>
    by an N.D. NURSE. Troi stands with Beverly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's after more than a history<br>
    lesson. I can tell you that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is it? What are you getting<br>
    from him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know. But it's like he's<br>
    trying to confuse us... misdirect<br>
    us somehow.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Well that certainly was exciting,<br>
    wasn't it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Professor. Is everything alright?<br>
    Are you well?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Couldn't be better, thank you.<br>
    I just thought we might chat about<br>
    your questionnaire.<br>
    (to the prone patient)<br>
    Buck up, crewman, you're a credit<br>
    to that uniform.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've got some things to take care<br>
    of.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    No, please Counselor. I would<br>
    very much appreciate your<br>
    remaining.</p>
  <p> Troi remains. She obviously doesn't like this guy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Doctor, in response to my sixth<br>
    question, you spoke of a neural<br>
    stimulator. May I see one?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't see why not.<br>
    (she finishes her<br>
    treatment)<br>
    Give me a minute.</p>
  <p> Beverly EXITS. Rasmussen and Troi walk slowly away<br>
    from the male patient.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    You don't like me very much, do<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't dislike you, Professor.</p>
  <p> They pass the nurse and child.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (to child)<br>
    Keep your eyes wide, soldier.<br>
    You'll be telling your<br>
    grandchildren how you were there<br>
    at Penthara Four.<br>
    (back to Troi)<br>
    But you don't trust me. You<br>
    should, you know.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Should I?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    &quot;Picard's empath won't trust you.&quot;<br>
    That's what they all said.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Picard's empath?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    We're not that unalike, you and<br>
    I. You possess a sense that is<br>
    foreign to the others. My<br>
    knowledge of the future is<br>
    similar. You know, some of my<br>
    best friends are empaths... they<br>
    trust me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why would you care whether I trust<br>
    you or not?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    We're birds of a feather...<br>
    colleagues. We could learn a lot<br>
    from each other.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're right... I don't trust you.</p>
  <p> Beverly returns carrying a neural stimulator.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (to Troi; a syrupy<br>
    smile)<br>
    I knew you'd say that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (returning the smile)<br>
    I'm sure you did.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (handing the neural<br>
    simulator to Rasmussen)<br>
    Well, it's nice to see you two<br>
    are finally getting along.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (holding back her<br>
    sarcasm)<br>
    I really must be going.</p>
  <p> As Troi EXITS, Beverly turns back to Rasmussen with a<br>
    warm smile. He returns the smile but seems a bit shy.<br>
    There's an awkward beat which ends when a NURSE hands<br>
    Beverly a PADD. Beverly punches something in and hands<br>
    it back to the nurse.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why don't you try a Berylite scan?<br>
    I'd be interested to see where<br>
    his micro-levels are.</p>
  <p> The nurse nods and EXITS. Beverly turns back to<br>
    Rasmussen.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So... what else can I show you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    You're a very curious woman.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    No, no. I don't mean curious like<br>
    that. I mean you're curious...<br>
    curious about things. About<br>
    Berylite levels... about the<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> They begin to walk back toward Beverly's office.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Curiosity is why most of us are<br>
    out here, professor.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I understand. But you're<br>
    different. More... vibrant.<br>
    More...</p>
  <p> Rasmussen is fishing for a word.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    More vibrant. That's nice, I like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> They enter the vestibule outside Beverly's office.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    You know, whenever I... travel<br>
    back, I meet very interesting<br>
    people... men and women. But<br>
    never anyone who gave me thoughts<br>
    about not going home.</p>
  <p> Beverly is genuinely flattered, a bit turned-on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're not supposed to be<br>
    influencing the past, remember?<br>
    And I'm beginning to feel a<br>
    little... influenced. Anyway,<br>
    I'm old enough to be your great,<br>
    great, great, great, grandmother!</p>
  <p> Rasmussen smiles warmly...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, the Ensign and other<br>
    supernumeraries at their stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of questions did he have<br>
    for you, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All he wanted to know about was<br>
    previous starships. What I<br>
    thought was innovative on the<br>
    last Enterprise or the one before<br>
    that. He said he wanted to see<br>
    how well we &quot;grasped the<br>
    fundamentals.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    His queries to me primarily<br>
    focused on Doctor Soong's...</p>
  <p> An ALARM is heard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am detecting a massive<br>
    earthquake on the surface.</p>
  <p> Another ALARM is heard. Riker moves to an aft station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Two earthquakes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Location?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Both epicenters are beneath the<br>
    two southernmost drill sites,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is La Forge still down there?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Find him.</p>
  <p> Worf starts pushing buttons on his panel. Another<br>
    alarm is heard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've also got some volcanic<br>
    activity... pretty severe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p>33 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the screen changes from a wider view of the planet<br>
    to a closer view, we see huge volcanic plumes rising<br>
    through the dense dust clouds.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here, Captain. Moseley<br>
    and I are on our way back to his<br>
    lab.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you alright?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're okay, but those were pretty<br>
    big, sir. If this was Earth, I'd<br>
    say around an eight or an eight<br>
    five on the Richter Scale. We're<br>
    starting to see some volcanic<br>
    plumes, Captain.</p>
  <p> More alarms are heard.</p>
  <p>34 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two more eruptions, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is most likely that we<br>
    overestimated the geologic<br>
    stability around the CO2 pockets.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're in the lab, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard motions to Worf to put Geordi on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p>35 ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and we see the interior of the lab. Everyone is busy<br>
    dealing with the emergency.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MOSELEY<br>
    We're fairly well quake-proofed<br>
    down here, Picard. It's the<br>
    volcanic dust I'm worried about.</p>
  <p> Another jolt hits the lab.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Moseley)<br>
    What about the dust?</p>
  <p> Another jolt hits the lab.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The ash the volcanos are throwing<br>
    into the atmosphere is going to<br>
    compound the existing problem.<br>
    In a matter of days, there'll be<br>
    no sunlight getting through those<br>
    clouds.</p>
  <p> MOSELEY<br>
    And no amount of CO2 is going to<br>
    help us then.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, look at this.</p>
  <p> Picard walks quickly to the aft station. Riker points<br>
    to one of two maps on a monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These are the coordinates of the<br>
    eruptions, and these...</p>
  <p> Riker points to the other map.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... are the phaser drilling sites.</p>
  <p> Riker presses a button and the two drawings overlap.<br>
    The points are nearly identical. Picard looks up at<br>
    Riker. Both men are aware of what has happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The mantle is collapsing where<br>
    the pressure was released.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, Doctor Moseley and I have<br>
    a couple of ideas, but they're<br>
    going to take some time to sort<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sort them out, Commander.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The view of the lab is replaced by the shrouded planet<br>
    with multiple volcanic plumes now visible. Lightning<br>
    can be seen at the cloud tops.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looking at the screen)<br>
    We came here to help these people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And look what we've done.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction we:</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>36 EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>37 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Rasmussen walks by some crewmen and cheerfully nods.<br>
    He goes to Data's door, rings the bell. The door opens<br>
    and a bizarre cacophony of sounds almost overpowers<br>
    him.</p>
  <p>38 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is busy at his console.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    What in God's name is that?!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    Music, Professor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/26/91 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    Music?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    Yes, sir. Mozart's &quot;Jupiter<br>
    symphony in G minor&quot;; Bach's &quot;Third<br>
    Brandenberg Concerto&quot;; Beethoven's<br>
    &quot;Symphony Number Nine, Second<br>
    Movement 'Molto Vivace'&quot;; and &quot;La<br>
    Donna e Mobile&quot;, from Verdi's<br>
    &quot;Rigoletto&quot;.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    Could you thin it out a bit?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, eliminate Program One.</p>
  <p> One of the four compositions is silenced. Rasmussen<br>
    shakes his head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, eliminate Program Two.</p>
  <p> Another program stops. Rasmussen shakes his head<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, eliminate Program Three.</p>
  <p> Only one is still playing. Rasmussen uses his finger<br>
    to suggest Data turn it down.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer, half volume.</p>
  <p> The sound gets quieter and Rasmussen nods approval.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    How the hell can you listen to<br>
    four pieces of music at the same<br>
    time?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually, I am capable of<br>
    distinguishing over one hundred<br>
    fifty simultaneous compositions.<br>

  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    But in order to analyze the<br>
    aesthetics, I try to limit myself<br>
    to ten or less.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Only four today?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am assisting Commander La Forge<br>
    in the analysis of an extremely<br>
    complex calculation. It demands<br>
    a great deal of my concentration.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I came to thank you for answering<br>
    my questions, though I probably<br>
    should have asked you to limit<br>
    yourself to fifty thousand words.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You did ask me to be thorough.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I realize it's hard to believe,<br>
    Data, but very few records of<br>
    Doctor Soong's work survived to<br>
    the twenty-sixth century. It<br>
    would be invaluable to myself and<br>
    other historians if you could<br>
    provide us with some schematics.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainly, as soon as my work here<br>
    is completed.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Just as long as it's before<br>
    oh-nine-hundred tomorrow. That's<br>
    when I'll be... heading back.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Commander Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander La Forge is hailing you<br>
    from the surface, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Patch it through, please.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Geordi appears on Data's MONITOR. As soon as Data<br>
    turns, Rasmussen takes a tricorder from the desk and,<br>
    almost inadvertantly, pockets it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Have you rerun the phase reversal<br>
    figures, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There were no errors, Geordi.<br>
    The variance must be no more than<br>
    point zero six terawatts.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't see any other choice.<br>
    We'll keep running the numbers<br>
    down here. You better inform the<br>
    captain... of the good news and<br>
    the bad news. La Forge out.</p>
  <p> The monitor goes to black.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Which do you suppose he's going<br>
    to want to hear first?</p>
  <p> Off Data's reaction we CUT TO:</p>
  <p>39 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> We open on CU of Picard. Data is there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The good news.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The motion of the dust has created<br>
    a great deal of electrostatic<br>
    energy in the upper atmosphere.<br>
    With a modified phaser blast, we<br>
    could create a shock-front that<br>
    would encircle the planet and<br>
    ionize the particles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That would be like striking a<br>
    spark in a room filled with gas.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    With one exception, sir. The<br>
    particles would be converted<br>
    into a high-energy plasma which<br>
    our shields could absorb and<br>
    redirect harmlessly into space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Turn the Enterprise into a<br>
    lightning rod.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Precisely, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what about the bad news, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If our phaser discharge is off<br>
    by as little as point-zero-six<br>
    terawatts, it would cause a<br>
    cascading exothermal inversion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meaning?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We would completely burn off the<br>
    planet's atmosphere.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>

    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    While Doctor Moseley takes La<br>
    Forge's plan to the leaders of<br>
    the colony, I find myself weighing<br>
    the potential consequences of a<br>
    more philosophical issue.</p>
  <p>42 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is staring out the window deep in thought. The<br>
    door chimes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (not turning)<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen ENTERS. Picard continues to stare out the<br>
    window.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would imagine you know why I've<br>
    asked you here.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I have a fairly good idea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm faced with a dilemma. There's<br>
    a planet beneath us that is slowly<br>
    turning to ice. If we don't do<br>
    something about it, I'm told that<br>
    within weeks, thousands, perhaps<br>
    tens of thousands, will die.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    That would be a shame.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turning to Rasmussen)<br>
    Yes, it would. It would be quite<br>
    a shame.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    So what's your dilemma?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge has a possible<br>
    solution. The margin of error<br>
    is extremely critical, but if it's<br>
    successful, there's no more<br>
    threat.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    And if it's not successful?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every living thing on the planet<br>
    will perish.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    So... do nothing and thousands<br>
    will die. Do something and<br>
    millions could die. Tough choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (speaking hypothetically<br>
    -- he's not asking)<br>
    Not if you were to help me.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    You're not suggesting I tell you<br>
    the outcome of your efforts?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, I'm not. Everything Starfleet<br>
    stands for, everything I've ever<br>
    believed in, tells me I can't<br>
    ask you that.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    But at the same time, there are<br>
    twenty million lives down there,<br>
    and you know what happened to<br>
    them... what will happen to them.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    So, it seems you have another<br>
    dilemma. One that questions your<br>
    convictions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have never been afraid to<br>
    reevaluate my convictions,<br>
    Professor. Right now, I have<br>
    twenty million reasons to do so.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    And why did you ask to see me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your presence potentially gives<br>
    me access to a kind of information<br>
    that was never available to me<br>
    before. An additional tool, a<br>
    new weapon in my armory... you,<br>
    Professor. If I'm going to<br>
    reexamine my beliefs, I must<br>
    take advantage of every possible<br>
    asset. It would be irresponsible<br>
    of me not to have you here.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    However you come to terms with<br>
    your beliefs, Captain, I must<br>
    tell you I'm quite comfortable <br>
    with mine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can you be? How can you be<br>
    &quot;comfortable&quot; watching people die?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (patronizing)<br>
    Let me put it this way. If I were<br>
    to tell you that none of those<br>
    people died, you'd easily conclude<br>
    that you tried your &quot;solution&quot;<br>
    and it succeeded. So, you'd<br>
    confidently try again. No harm<br>
    in that. But what if I were to<br>
    tell you they all died? What<br>
    then? Obviously, you'd decide not<br>
    to make the same mistake twice.<br>
    Now, what if one of those...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I know, Professor, &quot;What if one<br>
    of those lives I save down there<br>
    is a child who grows up to be the<br>
    next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh?&quot;<br>

  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    First year philosophy students<br>
    have been asked that question ever<br>
    since the earliest wormholes were<br>
    discovered. But this is not a<br>
    class in temporal logic... It's<br>
    not hypothetical, it's real.<br>
    Can't you see that?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I see it all too well. But you<br>
    must see that if I were to<br>
    influence you, everything in this<br>
    sector, in this quadrant of the<br>
    galaxy could change. History, my<br>
    history, would unfold in a way<br>
    other than it already has. Now<br>
    what possible incentive could<br>
    anyone offer me to allow that to<br>
    happen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have two choices. Either way,<br>
    one version or another of history<br>
    will wend its way forward. The<br>
    history you know or another one.<br>
    Who's to say which is better?<br>
    All I know here, today, is that<br>
    one way, millions of lives could<br>
    be saved. Isn't that incentive<br>
    enough?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Everyone dies, Captain. It's just<br>
    a question of when. All of those<br>
    people down there died years<br>
    before I was born. All of you<br>
    up here, as well. So you see,<br>
    I can't get quite as worked up<br>
    as you over the fate of some<br>
    colonists who, for me, have been<br>
    dead a long time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have a Prime Directive,<br>
    Professor, which tells us we have<br>
    no right to interfere with the<br>
    natural evolution of alien worlds.<br>

    But even though I am sworn to<br>
    uphold it, I have disregarded that<br>
    directive on more than one<br>
    occasion... When I knew it was<br>
    the right thing to do. If you<br>
    are holding true to some<br>
    &quot;temporal&quot; equivalent of that<br>
    directive, isn't there a<br>
    possibility that this is an<br>
    occasion for you to make an<br>
    exception, to help me choose...<br>
    because it's the right thing to<br>
    do?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Are we just talking about a<br>
    choice? It sounds to me like<br>
    you're trying to manipulate the<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every choice we make allows us<br>
    to manipulate the future. Do I<br>
    ask Marie or Suzanne to the spring<br>
    dance? Do I take my holiday on<br>
    Tahiti or on Risa? A man's life,<br>
    his future, hinges on each of a<br>
    thousand choices. Living is<br>
    making choices.<br>

    Now you ask me to believe that<br>
    if I make a choice other than the<br>
    one found in your history books,<br>
    it could irreparably alter your<br>
    past! Well, perhaps I don't give<br>
    a damn about your past, Professor<br>
    Rasmussen. Because your past is<br>
    my future and as far as I'm<br>
    concerned, it hasn't been written<br>
    yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, the electrostatic<br>
    conditions are about as good as<br>
    they're going to get. If we're<br>
    going to try this, now's the time.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Rasmussen. A beat.</p>
  <p> For a brief instant Rasmussen's guard drops. His<br>
    cockiness now has a trace of remorse.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Please don't ask me, Captain.<br>
    I can't help you. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> After a long stare, Picard almost seems to smile. He<br>
    turns and EXITS. Rasmussen innocently returns the<br>
    smile and follows Picard onto the bridge. On his way<br>
    out, Rasmussen takes a small pile of isolinear chips<br>
    from a table. They disappear into his pocket.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite the contrary, Professor.<br>
    You've been quite helpful.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    How's that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By your refusing to assist me,<br>
    I'm left with the same choice I<br>
    began with; to try or not to<br>
    try... to run the risk or to play<br>
    it safe. But your arguments have<br>
    reminded me how precious the right<br>
    to choose can be... that right<br>
    or wrong, the choice is mine.<br>

    Doctor Moseley's computers can<br>

  <p>53 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (NOTE: The following sequence of opticals will take<br>
    only ten-twelve seconds.) A thin orange beam fires<br>
    parallel to the others.</p>
  <p>54 EXT. SPACE - PENTHARA IV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The phaser beam hits the spot where the other beams<br>
    meet the cloud tops. A beat.</p>
  <p> An enormous EXPLOSION far below us. The orange glow<br>
    spreads in all directions and quickly begins to envelop<br>
    the clouded atmosphere.</p>
  <p> A few seconds later, as soon as the fiery orange<br>
    curtain has encapsulated the planet, a series of<br>
    glowing blue &quot;fingers&quot; spread from the far side toward<br>
    the point where the phaser originally hit. The blue<br>
    explosions are replacing the orange ones.</p>
  <p> As the final streak of blue &quot;glow&quot; replaces the last<br>
    visible area of orange, a pillar of blue light forms<br>
    and streaks toward the Enterprise.</p>

  <p> The blue light, which continues to envelop the planet<br>
    below, is still being drawn to the Enterprise in the<br>
    form of a thin beam, enveloping the ship, as well.</p>
  <p> The glowing ship rotates 180 degrees and an even<br>
    brighter blue beam appears from the deflector dish.<br>
    As it discharges out into space we see the glow on the<br>
    planet begin to dissipate as if it were being sucked<br>
    up through the beam reaching toward the ship, and then<br>
    off into deep space.</p>
  <p> It's over in seconds. The pillar of light from the<br>
    planet vanishes as the last of the energy is deflected<br>
    through the dish.</p>

  <p> The vessel's interior, similar to its exterior, is<br>
    truly futuristic, with multifaceted panels containing<br>
    minimal blinkies. As Data ENTERS, he immediately<br>
    notices two large collector trays.</p>
  <p> Normally slid into a rack, the trays are exposed and<br>
    filled with objects stolen from the Enterprise: two<br>
    tricorders, a neural stimulator, a hypospray and<br>
    bioscanner, one of Geordi's visors, PADDS, a small desk<br>
    top viewer, a Klingon knife, piles of isolinear chips<br>
    and other computer chips, palm beacons, even bar<br>
    glasses and silverware from Ten Forward, and various<br>
    other whatsits from here and there. Data examines the<br>
    loot and turns to Rasmussen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe any of these<br>
    items belong to you, Professor.</p>

  <p> Data stands very still.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you plan to put these objects<br>
    into a museum?</p>

    my time, and he had the misfortune<br>
    of meeting me... His clothes<br>
    fit quite well, don't you think?<br>
    (gesturing to the pod)<br>
    Took me weeks to figure out how<br>
    to work this thing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are not an historian?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    More of an inventor. Up till a<br>
    few weeks ago, a dismally<br>
    unsuccessful one.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What are your intentions, now?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Well, thanks to your captain, it<br>
    seems my intentions have changed<br>
    slightly.</p>
  <p> He points to the trays.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was quite content with the<br>
    notion of returning with those<br>
    trinkets. I'd &quot;invent&quot; about one<br>
    a year. But now, look what<br>
    fortune has graced me with...<br>
    (pointing toward Data)<br>
    You will take a little longer to<br>
    figure out than a tricorder, but<br>
    it should be well worth the<br>
    effort.</p>
  <p> He checks his ring.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If the auto-timer is programmed<br>
    the way I think it is...<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN (cont'd)<br>
    in about two minutes we'll be on<br>
    our way back to a place called<br>
    New Jersey... I'm afraid you<br>
    won't be awake for the ride.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen aims the phaser at Data and tries to fire,<br>
    but it only makes a lame noise. Panicked, he readjusts<br>
    and fires again... nothing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assume your hand print will open<br>
    the door whether you are conscious<br>
    or not.</p>
  <p> Off Rasmussen's look, we CUT TO:</p>
  <p>67 INT. SHUTTLEBAY - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Riker, Worf, and an N.D. Security<br>
    guard, as before. The vessel door opens and Rasmussen<br>
    exits, closely followed by Data, who now carries the<br>
    phaser.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (disgusted)<br>
    That weapon was working yesterday.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard, handing him<br>
    the phaser)<br>
    You were correct to suspect him,<br>
    sir. But he is from the past,<br>
    not the future.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to what Data says and turns to Rasmussen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (mimicking Rasmussen<br>
    in Act Four)<br>
    Trying to make my history unfold<br>
    in a way other than it already<br>
    has, Professor?</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    This was all a misunderstanding,<br>
    Picard. Just let me back in there<br>
    and we'll forget the whole thing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (still mimicking)<br>
    Now what possible incentive could<br>
    anyone offer me to allow that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I believe you will find all the<br>
    missing items in the vessel, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker nods to Worf who acknowledges and heads into the<br>
    vessel. Rasmussen turns to Beverly with a desperate,<br>
    pleading look.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Doctor...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (ice)<br>
    A very nice performance.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (a touch of remorse)<br>
    Not all of it. Some of it was<br>
    real.</p>
  <p> Beverly's cold stare tells him he's wasting his time.<br>
    He checks his ring and turns toward Picard, panicky.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He claims to be a twenty-second<br>
    century inventor, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (it's all coming into<br>
    focus)<br>
    Well, it's too bad you weren't<br>
    a bit more inventive. If fewer<br>
    things had disappeared, we might<br>
    not have suspected you. As it<br>
    was, our only stumbling block was<br>
    your vessel. Our sensors couldn't<br>
    penetrate it.</p>
  <p> Worf climbs out of the pod carrying the two trays.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But as soon as the door opened,<br>
    our computer was able to detect<br>
    and deactivate everything you'd<br>
    stolen...<br>
    (holding up the phaser)<br>
    ... including this.</p>
  <p> Picard drops it onto the top tray as Worf passes him.<br>
    Worf hands the trays to the N.D. security guard.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    I'd love to hear more, Picard,<br>
    but I really must get back in that<br>
    pod.</p>
  <p> Rasmussen heads for the vessel, but is stopped by Worf.<br>
    Picard looks to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take him to a detention cell,<br>
    Mister Worf. And notify Starfleet<br>
    that we'll be dropping him off<br>
    at Starbase Two-one-four.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    (panicking, struggling)<br>
    You can't do this... I've got<br>
    to get back... I don't belong<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> The tiny ship suddenly GLOWS, SHIMMERS, and DISAPPEARS.<br>
    Rasmussen can't believe it.</p>
  <p> RASMUSSEN<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> Worf walks him toward the exit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure there are more than a<br>
    few legitimate historians at<br>
    Starfleet who will be quite eager<br>
    to meet a Human from your era.</p>
  <p> Worf and Rasmussen reach the exit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Oh, and Professor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; - 9/20/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Rasmussen stops and turns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Welcome to the twenty-fourth<br>
    century.</p>
  <p> Worf and Rasmussen EXIT. Off reactions, we CUT TO:</p>
  <p>68 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit of Penthara IV.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
