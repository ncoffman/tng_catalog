  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit of Earth.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45959.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has been recalled<br>
    to sector zero zero one on a<br>
    priority mission.</p>
  <p>2 EXT. 24TH CENTURY SAN FRANCISCO - DAY - ESTABLISHING</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All we've been told is that<br>
    evidence has been discovered<br>
    indicating the presence of<br>
    extraterrestrials on Earth...<br>
    five centuries ago.</p>
  <p>3 INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN</p>
  <p> PICARD and DATA move down a tunnel illuminated by<br>
    mining lights... a SCIENTIST, male, late forties,<br>
    leads the way...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    Work crews were down here<br>
    installing seismic regulators when<br>
    they found some remarkable<br>
    artifacts...</p>
  <p> He pulls back a tarp to reveal a collection of<br>
    artifacts from the late 1800s... perhaps a broken pair<br>
    of bifocals, a pocket watch, a pistol, a canteen,<br>
    bullets and bullet case...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And it's been determined that they<br>
    date back to the late nineteenth<br>
    century... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/09/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (studying them)<br>
    The biofocal vision aide is<br>
    typical of the era... the weapon<br>
    is a forty-five caliber single<br>
    action cavalry pistol invented<br>
    by Colt Firearms in 1873.</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Look inside the watch.</p>
  <p> Data examines the watch and opens it... time has<br>
    stopped long ago... the face is cracked and broken...<br>
    there is an engraving: &quot;To S.L.C., with love. 30<br>
    November, 1889.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What makes you think<br>
    extraterrestrials are related to<br>
    this discovery...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    The crew was having a problem with<br>
    the regulators... something in<br>
    the cavern was interfering with<br>
    the phase conditioners... it<br>
    turned out to be the cavern<br>
    itself... do you have a tricorder,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> Data takes out his tricorder and takes readings, reacts<br>
    curiously...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The composition of the exposed<br>
    rockface has been altered by<br>
    exposure to triolic waves...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    Which you're not going to find<br>
    on Earth... in either the<br>
    nineteenth or twenty-fourth<br>
    century...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Triolic waves?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/09/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The byproduct of an energy<br>
    source employed by very few<br>
    species because of its deleterious<br>
    effects on living tissue...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    We've confirmed that no one has<br>
    been in or out of this cavern in<br>
    centuries... so we're left with<br>
    a five-hundred-year-old mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm curious, Doctor. There are<br>
    far greater experts on Earth who<br>
    could investigate your mystery.<br>
    Why bring the Enterprise all the<br>
    way home?</p>
  <p> The scientist gives them a quick, grim glance ...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    As we continued our excavation,<br>
    we found one other thing I haven't<br>
    shown you yet...</p>
  <p> He leads them across the chamber...</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    We've tried to leave everything<br>
    as we found it...</p>
  <p> He pulls back another tarp to reveal something we don't<br>
    immediately see...</p>
  <p>4 PICARD</p>
  <p> reacts, stunned.</p>
  <p>5 DATA</p>
  <p> reacts, very curious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 THE SCIENTIST</p>
  <p> studies their reactions and as he looks back down we<br>
    follow his gaze to see Data's head broken at the<br>
    neck... dusty, old and dead...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/16/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Still in orbit of Earth...</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45960.2.<br>
    We have transported the materials<br>
    discovered in the cavern back to<br>
    the ship for analysis. I wish I<br>
    could be as dispassionate about<br>
    the implications as my second<br>
    officer...</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Close on Data's head at a work station... it is open,<br>
    circuitry exposed, Data examines it with a 24th-century<br>
    microscopic device... Picard and RIKER look over his<br>
    shoulder, waiting for some conclusion...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interesting... there has been a<br>
    twelve percent decomposition of<br>
    the bitanium in the neural pathway<br>
    links... it suggests the alloys<br>
    are vulnerable to...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yessir... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How can you look inside that...<br>
    and analyze the decomposition...<br>
    without... without...</p>
  <p> Riker struggles for the right word for a beat...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Emotion, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... without, I don't know...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/13/92 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am simply trying to make an<br>
    objective assessment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it... yours, Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am quite certain that it is,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could it be Lore?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My brother's positronic brain had<br>
    a type L phase-discriminating<br>
    amplifier... mine is type R.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: the head)<br>
    Type R?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (acknowledging)<br>
    Yessir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you determine how long it has<br>
    been in the cavern?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (glances at Riker)<br>
    As I was going to say, the<br>
    decomposition strongly indicates<br>
    that life was terminated<br>
    approximately five hundred years<br>
    ago. That would be consistent<br>
    with the other artifacts recovered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your head is not an artifact.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In relative terms, perhaps not.<br>
    Nevertheless, it seems clear that<br>
    my life is to end in the late<br>
    nineteenth century.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not if we can help it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (curious)<br>
    There is nothing anyone can do<br>
    to prevent it, sir.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    At some future date, I will be<br>
    transported back to nineteenth<br>
    century Earth... where I will die.<br>
    It has occurred. It will occur.</p>
  <p> The ease with which he speaks it is unnerving.<br>
    GEORDI, who has been working in another part of<br>
    engineering, moves to them...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't tell you exactly who the<br>
    aliens were... but I have found<br>
    out a few things...</p>
  <p> He sits at a computer station... calls up something<br>
    on the monitor...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The triolicized rock face tells<br>
    us we're probably dealing with<br>
    a species with microcentrum cell<br>
    membranes. Triolic waves<br>
    wouldn't harm them. Also might<br>
    mean they're shape shifters of<br>
    some kind...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So they could have appeared as<br>
    Humans on Earth...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I don't think it's anyone we've<br>
    run into before... nothing we<br>
    found matches up with any known<br>
    lifeform...</p>
  <p> He switches programs...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What does match up... is a<br>
    cellular fossil that might have<br>
    just come along for the ride...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cellular fossil... ?</p>
  <p>9 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> He calls up a blow-up of a one cell fossil...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A microscopic ciliated<br>
    lifeform... not that different<br>
    from a thousand other single cell<br>
    lifeforms that you'd find on any<br>
    planet surface... except this<br>
    particular one is<br>
    L-B-one-zero-four-four-five...<br>
    and L-B-one-zero-four-four-five<br>
    is only known to exist on one<br>
    planet... Devidia Two in the<br>
    Marrab sector...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, lay in a course...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir...</p>
  <p> He EXITS... there's a moment when Picard exchanges a<br>
    glance with Data, like there's something he might like<br>
    to say, but then he follows Riker out... on Data's<br>
    expression...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Going to warp.</p>
  <p>11 INT. TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi sit at the bar... a beat in silence...<br>
    Geordi is obviously shaken by the events, is<br>
    depressed...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So?</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no reference point by which<br>
    your question can be answered.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So... do you feel like talking<br>
    about it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you referring to the<br>
    foreknowledge of my death?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no particular desire to<br>
    discuss the matter.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you feel like talking about<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data... it's gotta bother you<br>
    a little...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    On the contrary, I find it<br>
    rather... comforting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Comforting...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have often wondered about my<br>
    own mortality as I have seen<br>
    others age around me... Until now,<br>
    it has been theoretically possible<br>
    that I would live an unlimited<br>
    period of time. And although<br>
    some might find this attractive,<br>
    to me it only reinforces the fact<br>
    that I am... artificial.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I never realized... how tough all<br>
    this must be for you...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Tough&quot;?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Knowing that you would outlive<br>
    all your friends.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (blind to sentiment)<br>
    I expected to make new friends.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    True.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And then outlive them as well.</p>
  <p> A poignant beat. Geordi nods, beginning to understand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now that you know you might not...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... it provides a sense of<br>
    completion to my future. In a<br>
    way, I am not so different from<br>
    anyone else. I can now look<br>
    forward to death.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I never thought of it that way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One might even conclude that it<br>
    brings me one step closer to being<br>
    Human. I am mortal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/20/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Picard to bridge officers...<br>
    we're approaching the Devidia<br>
    system... report to your<br>
    stations...</p>
  <p> Data rises to leave...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    See you later... let's get<br>
    together for a game of chess or<br>
    something, okay?</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head, acknowledges, EXITS. Geordi looks<br>
    down at his drink, shakes his head and grins...</p>
  <p> GUINAN (o.c.)<br>
    Looked like quite an intense<br>
    discussion.</p>
  <p> He looks up</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE</p>
  <p> to see GUINAN arriving...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... talking about life, death,<br>
    the future...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Somebody getting married?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Naw. Somebody's gonna die.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Die?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They found Data's head a mile<br>
    below San Francisco... been down<br>
    there for five centuries...</p>
  <p> A solemn expression passes across her face... she's<br>
    disconcerted by the announcement...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's why the Enterprise was sent<br>
    back to Earth... I didn't<br>
    realize...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/20/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, something, isn't it?</p>
  <p> She looks at him with a unusually concerned<br>
    expression... she knew this was coming... she's been<br>
    waiting for it...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He seems fine about it... better<br>
    than I am...<br>
    (stands)<br>
    I better get to engineering...</p>
  <p> She acknowledges... and he EXITS... and stay on her<br>
    for a long beat... and push into her as she says to<br>
    herself...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Full circle.</p>
  <p> And we may not know what it means yet... but the way<br>
    she says it... with fatalist tones... we realize she<br>
    has knowledge about this that she has not shared with<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p>12A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker is at a turbolift as Troi arrives... an<br>
    acknowledgment and then...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I heard about Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's having an unusually traumatic<br>
    effect on everyone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If you don't want to talk about<br>
    it, it's okay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm fine. I'm just...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/20/92 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p>12A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ...angry.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No not angry.<br>

  <p>53 RESUME AND INCLUDE A BEGGAR</p>
  <p> in his sixties, unsteady on his feet, who has just<br>
    stepped up to Data.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That is unfortunate.</p>
  <p> BEGGAR<br>
    Most unfortunate. I require large<br>
    quantites of whiskey as a<br>
    linament.</p>
  <p> The man gives a dry cough and slumps for a moment<br>
    against Data... he takes a deep ragged breath to<br>
    collect himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry but I have no whiskey<br>
    to give you.</p>
  <p> BEGGAR<br>
    I'll take a dime.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry. But I have no form<br>
    of legal tender.</p>
  <p> The beggar considers Data for a moment.</p>
  <p> BEGGER<br>
    We're both in the same boat, eh?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is my corner. Go find your<br>
    own.</p>
  <p> A beat. Data takes advantage of the moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would be happy to do so.<br>
    However, I am presently in need<br>
    of information.</p>
  <p> BEGGAR<br>
    (grudginly)<br>
    The stockbrokers are cheap as hell<br>
    -- don't even ask 'em. Best<br>
    handout is a young man with his<br>
    lady. You give him a chance to<br>
    impress her by bein' generous.<br>
    But stay clear of the sailors --<br>
    likely as not, you'll get a fist<br>
    across the jaw for your trouble.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you for the advice, but I<br>
    am trying to find two individuals<br>
    with a snake.</p>

  <p> BEGGAR<br>
    (scowls, pointing)<br>
    A snake? You're an odd fellow,<br>
    aren't you? Best not be too<br>
    particular about who you're<br>
    requesting funds from --</p>
  <p> The Beggar starts to cough violently --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You require medical attention.<br>
    I will find a doctor --</p>
  <p> BEGGAR<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's too late for that...</p>
  <p> The Beggar struggles off after another passerby --</p>
  <p> BEGGAR<br>

  <p> -- leaving Data alone.</p>
  <p> Data drops the newspaper where he found it, glances<br>
    around the street...</p>
  <p>54 ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE</p>
  <p> A BELLBOY is loading a suitcase into a HORSEDRAWN<br>
    CARRIAGE as the suitcase owner stands by. The man<br>
    hands some coins to the Bellboy, then gets into the<br>
    carriage. The Bellboy closes the door after him, and<br>
    the carriage is driven off.</p>
  <p>54A INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> heading over toward him, as the Bellboy steps over to<br>
    two MEN who are standing at a doorway nearby. The<br>
    Bellboy hands the coins over to one of them.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Put it on Gentleman Jim. K.O.<br>
    in the fifth.</p>
  <p> The man nods. The Bellboy heads for the Hotel entrance<br>
    -- Data is waiting for him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I require temporary lodging.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy reacts to Data's clothes and appearance.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (indicates Data's<br>
    clothes)<br>
    Looks like the missus booted you<br>
    out in the middle of the night.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment -- the light goes on in his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand the source of your<br>
    misperception.<br>
    (indicating clothes)<br>
    But this is not sleepware. And<br>
    I have no... missus.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy is staring at him doubtfully.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/13/92 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>54A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A beat -- Data grabs at a cover story.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am a Frenchman.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy shrugs.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Everybody's from somewhere. That<br>
    doesn't matter at this hotel.<br>
    It's six bits a day or four<br>
    dollars a week.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no money.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Now that matters...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am capable of performing a<br>
    significant range of tasks -- both<br>
    mental and physical. Perhaps your<br>
    hotel could offer me... a job.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Well, I don't know. We got a maid<br>
    we're pretty happy with. The<br>
    cook's decent. The dishwasher's<br>
    drunk all day but at least he<br>
    shows up on time. And then<br>
    there's me -- I do everything<br>
    else.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, an N.D. MAN steps out of the hotel behind<br>
    them, putting his hat on, looking down in the dumps<br>
    as he steps past them.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (to man)<br>
    Lady Luck not with ya, tonight,<br>
    Mister Lane?</p>
  <p> The man shoots him a hard look, then sullenly continues<br>
    offscreen. A beat until he's gone, and the Bellboy<br>
    laughs to Data.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hasn't filled a straight in five<br>
    weeks.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Poker?</p>
  <p> OFF Data's face...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>54B INT. POKER ROOM - DAY - ON THE DOOR</p>
  <p> A KNOCK. No response. A beat and the door opens,<br>
    revealing Data, who steps inside. He looks up, sees<br>
    what he came for.</p>
  <p>55 ON A POKER TABLE</p>
  <p> where the tension is palpable. No one has even glanced<br>
    in Data's direction.</p>
  <p> Four MEN are at the poker table: A sophisticated NEW<br>
    ORLEANS GAMBLER in Southern gentleman clothes,<br>
    including a BLACK VEST. A burly, mean-looking SEAMAN<br>
    in appropriate costume. An AMERICAN INDIAN wearing<br>
    urban, nontribal clothing, including a BOWLER HAT. A<br>
    slightly chubby, local BUSINESSMAN.</p>
  <p> The Gambler and the American Indian appear to be the<br>
    big winners, with considerable piles of currency and<br>
    silver dollars in front of each.</p>
  <p> They are at the end of a hand. Frustrated, the<br>
    Businessman tosses down his cards, folding. The<br>
    Gambler carefully puts his cards down as well.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    Fold.</p>
  <p> The Seaman is in a staring match with the American<br>
    Indian, both still holding their hands. The Seaman<br>
    studies his impassive opponent -- the American Indian<br>
    is unreadable.</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>
    Go to Blazes!</p>
  <p> He angrily tosses down his hand, folding. The American<br>
    Indian silently collects the money in the pot, as the<br>
    Gambler laughs.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    A poker face carved in marble.</p>
  <p> The Seaman puts a meaty hand on the Indian's downturned<br>
    cards, intending to turn them over.</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>
    What'd ya have?</p>
  <p> The Indian immediately lays his own hand on the cards<br>
    -- stopping the Seaman from revealing them. There is a<br>
    silent, tense beat of impending violence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT THREE 28A.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    (to Seaman)<br>
    Mind you, sir. It's a gentleman's<br>
    prerogative to divulge a bluff.<br>
    (re: Indian)<br>
    Our friend wishes to remain<br>
    cryptic. I believe it proper to<br>
    respect that wish...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The Gambler is all smiles and conciliatory -- but<br>
    there's a threat behind it that the physically more<br>
    imposing seaman can't ignore.</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>
    (taking his hand off<br>
    cards)<br>
    The devil take you all...</p>
  <p> He crosses his arms together, steaming. The Gambler<br>
    gathers all the cards together and begins to shuffle<br>
    as the Seaman glances up in surprise at an unseen<br>
    interloper.</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>
    (continuing; toward<br>
    offscreen)<br>
    What in hell do you want?</p>
  <p>56 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> standing nearby, having waited patiently for the hand<br>
    to end.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would like to join your game.</p>
  <p> Everyone gives him the once-over, a little taken aback<br>
    by his appearance. The Indian alone is completely<br>
    unruffled. He takes one look, and with a<br>
    sophisticated, dry as dust delivery (NO cliche'd<br>
    &quot;Injun-speak&quot;) makes a joke off Data's skin tone.</p>
  <p> AMERICAN INDIAN<br>
    Pale... face.</p>
  <p> The other players all laugh uproariously at the pun.<br>
    The laughter dies down, the Seaman makes an unfriendly<br>
    scowl toward Data.</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>
    (re: Data's appearance)<br>
    Don't like Easterners, personally.</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head, now more secure in his role as<br>
    foreign visitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (confident)<br>
    I am a Frenchman.</p>
  <p> The Gambler perks up at this, not quite believing it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/09/92 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    Ah. Mes parents sont originaires<br>
    de Bourgogne. Je suis ne a la<br>
    New Orleans.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to this unexpected response, taken<br>
    momentarily for a loss. A beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (perfect accent)<br>
    Alors nous sommes presque freres.<br>
    Je suis heureux de vous connaitre.</p>
  <p> The Gambler laughs, surprised at the answer, then<br>
    indicates an empty chair.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    Please, sir.</p>
  <p> Data sits down as the Gambler exchanges glances with<br>
    his cohorts -- &quot;we've got a live one here.&quot; The<br>
    Gambler finishes up a shuffle, placing the deck in<br>
    front of the android.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The game is poker. The deal is<br>
    yours. The ante is four bits.</p>
  <p> Data confidently removes his COMMUNICATOR and places it<br>
    in the center of the table.</p>
  <p> Everyone eyes the shining device.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    Family heirloom?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In a manner of speaking. It is<br>
    a crystalline composite of<br>
    silicon, beryllium...</p>
  <p> The Seaman picks it up and BITES INTO IT.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Carbon-seventy, and --</p>
  <p> SEAMAN<br>

    Gold.</p>
  <p> The Seaman puts it back down.</p>
  <p> GAMBLER<br>
    I'll give you three bucks for it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I accept.</p>
  <p> The Gambler takes the communicator and pushes a few<br>
    of his winnings over to Data.</p>
  <p> Data cuts the deck, picks up the two halves and<br>
    shuffles them with an expert hand.</p>
  <p> OFF the other players' reactions to the perfect snap of<br>
    the cards...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/13/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>57 INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM</p>
  <p> A modest hotel room, with a single bed, a desk, and a<br>
    window. The door UNLOCKS AND OPENS. The Bellboy<br>
    ENTERS, holding out an arm as if to present the room --<br>
    and Data STEPS INSIDE.</p>
  <p> The android is now wearing the American Indian's BOWLER<br>
    HAT and the Gambler's BLACK VEST. He has obviously<br>
    cleaned up big at the card game.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Did you see the looks on their<br>
    faces? I did everything I could<br>
    not to laugh.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To whom are you referring?</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (what else)<br>
    Frederick La Rouque and Joe<br>
    Falling Hawk. Those two are card<br>
    sharks. Oh sure, they play it<br>
    easy at first so they don't scare<br>
    off the marks, but give 'em enough<br>
    time and they'll bleed a man dry<br>
    -- especially an out-of-towner.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What was the source of your<br>
    jocular reaction?</p>
  <p> The kid looks blank.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What was it you found humorous?</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Don't you see? They had you<br>
    pegged for a sap.<br>
    (indicates Data's<br>
    appearance)<br>
    Those clothes you got on, the way<br>
    you talk -- it's like you were<br>
    born yesterday. You sure had them<br>
    fooled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was not my intention to<br>
    deceive.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy looks at Data's innocent face. The Bellboy<br>
    can't decide whether Data's telling the truth or not.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/13/92 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The kid shrugs.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Have it your way.<br>
    (indicates the room)<br>
    This is the place. Breakfast is<br>
    from six to eight. Checkout's<br>
    at noon when you're ready to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy stands there waiting -- the classic tip<br>
    situation, but Data doesn't get it. The Bellboy holds<br>
    out his hand. Data shakes it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It has been a pleasure.</p>
  <p> Data lets go of his hand and steps toward the window<br>
    to glance outside.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy CLEARS HIS THROAT. Data turns.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It would be advisable to monitor<br>
    that cough. I have read that<br>
    there is currently an epidemic<br>
    of cholera in San Francisco...</p>
  <p> The young man is impatient. Annoyed at having to go<br>
    through this to get a tip.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Never felt better.</p>
  <p> Data still doesn't get it. The Bellboy again sticks<br>
    out his hand, palm raised. Data stares at it,<br>
    considers the situation -- finally understands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course. The gratuity.</p>
  <p> The bellboy gives him an impatient grin of<br>
    acknowledgement. Data pulls out a big wad of CASH from<br>
    his waistband -- the poker winnings -- and peels off<br>
    a dollar bill, handing it to the Bellboy.</p>

  <p> A beat as the kid stares dumbstruck at Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are welcome.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy steps into the doorway, then turns back to<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    If there's anything you need --<br>
    it can get lonely in San<br>
    Francisco. You might want some<br>
    company. I can introduce you to<br>
    Lillian.</p>
  <p> Data considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no need for companionship.<br>
    However, I do require some...<br>
    supplies.</p>
  <p> Data steps over to the desk and picks up a PEN, dipping<br>
    it into an INKPOT and writing onto a piece of PAPER.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Anything you need, I can get it<br>
    for you wholesale... I can get<br>
    it for you less than wholesale<br>
    if you don't ask me where it came<br>
    from...</p>
  <p> Data hands him the piece of paper. The Bellboy stares<br>
    at it, a bit puzzled by what he sees.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    What do you need all this stuff<br>
    for?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am an inventor...</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    No kidding... well this is gonna<br>
    take a while. I'll hafta go clear<br>
    cross town.<br>

    extreme state, he seems to feel the darkness intrude<br>
    upon his heart... His eyes struggle open.</p>
  <p>60 A COUPLE</p>
  <p> are standing in front of him. Both the man and woman<br>
    are tall, handsome, elegantly dressed, aristocratic.<br>
    But their faces are cold and expressionless -- like<br>
    demons. The man holds a CANE with an elaborately<br>
    carved SNAKE'S HEAD. The woman carries a VALISE,<br>
    almost like a doctor's bag. They stare at the beggar,<br>

    the Valise, aiming it at the dying man.</p>
  <p> The Valise GLOWS with a weird lighting effect, and<br>
    extends a FIELD out toward the man's body, enveloping<br>
    him for a moment, then withdrawing back into the<br>
    Valise, which stops glowing.</p>

    emotional repercussions among my<br>
    crew, I must move this mission<br>
    forward.</p>
  <p>63 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi, Worf, BEVERLY. Cutting<br>
    into the middle of a rare argument between Riker and<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not willing to accept that<br>
    he's dead and leave it at that...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data cannot be our<br>
    priority...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's more important than Data?</p>
  <p> Troi understands best at the table what Picard is<br>
    saying, says it with the compassion... understanding<br>
    the pain the people at the table are feeling...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Look at what we have so far...<br>
    evidence that these aliens have<br>
    been travelling back in time to<br>
    Earth...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What if they're trying to<br>
    undermine our history for some<br>
    reason... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Some kind of guerilla war...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/09/92 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We have to operate on the<br>
    assumption that there is a<br>
    threat... if not to us then to<br>
    19th-century Earth. Our first<br>
    order of business is to determine<br>
    what that threat may be.<br>
    (turns to Geordi)<br>
    In order to do that, Mister La<br>
    Forge, we must find a way to<br>
    communicate with these<br>
    life-forms...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's not going to be easy to<br>
    reproduce what Data did. We can<br>
    create a contained subspace<br>
    field... but we'd need an<br>
    extraordinarily sensitive phase<br>
    discriminator to get that point<br>
    zero-zero-four variance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you build one?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It won't be as good as Data's...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will it be good enough?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know. I can try... it's<br>
    going to take a while...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't want anyone else going<br>
    in alone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I should be able to create a<br>
    subspace field large enough to<br>
    encompass everyone. Adjusting<br>
    the phase inside the field will<br>
    be the hard part.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He rises, signalling the end to the meeting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's one thing we have to<br>
    assume, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Riker...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That wherever he is, Data's doing<br>
    the same thing we are... trying<br>
    to get to the bottom of this...<br>
    he may know a lot more about<br>
    what's going on than we do. It<br>
    might be in the best interests<br>
    of this mission to find him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps in the course of our<br>
    investigation we will. I hope<br>
    so.</p>
  <p> As the others exit, Worf stands back with Riker for<br>
    a beat...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (sotto, to Riker)<br>
    If we do find Commander Data, it<br>
    may be our fate to die with him...<br>
    in the past. If our remains are<br>
    in that cavern... they would have<br>
    turned to dust long ago.</p>
  <p> He exchanges a look with Riker...</p>
  <p>64 INT. TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> After hours. The lighting is a little dimmer than<br>
    normal. Two crewmembers at a far table are the only<br>
    customers present.</p>
  <p> Guinan is behind the bar, working diligently over a<br>
    dozen pieces of variously sized and shaped GLASSWARE,<br>
    containing liquids or solid crystals of many hues.</p>
  <p> She's carefully pouring from a tiny vial into a LARGE<br>
    GLASS, the tension and concentration evident on her<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> PICARD (o.s.)<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I'm afraid to interrupt.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/06/92 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>65 INCLUDE PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stepping up to the bar as Guinan continues to pour<br>
    without answering him until she's emptied the tiny<br>
    vial. She relaxes and glances up.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Captain. You didn't have to come<br>
    to me. I would've been happy to<br>
    go to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: glassware)<br>
    And let me miss all this? I<br>
    haven't seen such a complex<br>
    operation since the Academy lab<br>
    final in exochemistry.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's a Tzartak aperitif. Very,<br>
    very touchy.</p>
  <p> She picks up a small beaker and carefully pours.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The trick is to change the<br>
    evaporation point of the main<br>
    ingredient. You want the<br>
    temperature where the liquid goes<br>
    to vapor to be half a degree below<br>
    the body temperature of your<br>
    customer.</p>
  <p> She adds a few tiny crystals to the glass.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That way, the moment the liquid<br>
    touches the tongue, it evaporates.<br>
    The flavor is carried entirely<br>
    by the vapor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She adds a few drops of liquid to the glass.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it's a highly delicate affair.<br>
    A few molecules off and the vapor<br>
    point crashes. Poof. It's gone.<br>
    All of it.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard studies her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What did you want to see me about?</p>
  <p> A beat as Guinan studies her glassware.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I hear you're sending an away team<br>
    down to the surface.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Are you going along?</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to the question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is rather unusual... for you<br>
    to be curious about an away<br>
    mission...</p>
  <p> Guinan shrugs, starts slowly adding, drop by drop,<br>
    another liquid to the glass.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Maybe it's an unusual away<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guinan, if you have something to<br>
    tell me, I'm listening.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Guinan stops pouring. She stares straight at him, is<br>
    more direct than we've ever seen her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Starfleet captains usually don't<br>
    accompany away teams...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (agrees)<br>
    That's general policy...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    This time you have to...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You just... do.</p>
  <p> He studies her a long beat... he needs more than that<br>
    and she knows it.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You remember when we first met?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Don't be so sure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I mean... if you don't go on this<br>
    mission...</p>
  <p> She drops a single tiny crystal into the glass. A<br>
    beat, then the liquid in the glass suddenly and<br>
    furiously BOILS away in less than one second.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    ... we didn't.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's reaction.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT FOUR 40A-41. </p>
  <p>67 INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> Data is at his desk, using a high-tech device he has<br>
    built out of 19th-century materials. He is working<br>
    on the exposed PHASER HOUSING. Data is now completely<br>
    dressed in 19th-century clothing -- days have passed<br>
    since we last saw him.</p>
  <p> SOUND: A heavy, low, muffled THUMP offscreen.</p>
  <p> Data glances up toward the door. A beat and he turns<br>
    back to the work at hand.</p>
  <p> Another THUMP. This time closer. Data continues to<br>
    work. Another beat, another THUMP.</p>
  <p> Data finally sets down the instrument and moves toward<br>
    the door.</p>
  <p> The loudest THUMP yet, right outside. Data opens the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p>68 OMITTED</p>
  <p>69 INCLUDE THE BELLBOY</p>
  <p> at the doorstep. Tucked in his back pocket is a<br>
    rolled-up NEWSPAPER and at his feet is a HUGE ANVIL.<br>
    The young man has obviously just moved it up the stairs<br>
    to Data's room. He appears exhausted.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Sorry it took so long, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An apology is not required.</p>
  <p> Data casually reaches down with one hand -- AND PICKS<br>
    UP THE ANVIL as though it weighed an ounce. He starts<br>
    toward the center of the room -- there's a noise of<br>
    astonishment from the Bellboy.</p>
  <p> Data STOPS, knowing he's just made a huge mistake.<br>
    The android quickly sets down the anvil, as if dropping<br>
    it. He clutches his arm as though strained.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    You alright?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I appear to have overexerted<br>
    myself...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/09/92 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    I'll say.</p>
  <p> A beat as the kid glances up at the light bouncing<br>
    around the room. There's a glint of curiosity and<br>
    lightness in his eyes that we've never seen before.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    You got it working.</p>
  <p> Data pulls out a dollar for tip money and hands it to<br>
    the Bellboy, but the young man IGNORES it, continuing<br>
    to stare fascinated at the light bouncing around the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Whatever it is.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: money)<br>
    This is for your trouble.</p>
  <p> The Bellboy accepts it, but distractedly, as if more<br>
    interested in what Data's created.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    What are you gonna do with the<br>
    anvil?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I require a low intensity,<br>
    magnetic field core. The<br>
    iron mass of the anvil will<br>
    provide that.</p>
  <p> The kid nods without comprehension.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    What's it gonna be when it's<br>
    finished?</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head as he tries to form a reply...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do you think it is... &quot;gonna<br>
    be&quot;... ?</p>

  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    If I were to guess... maybe a new<br>
    kind of motor for one of those<br>
    horseless carriages...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is a good guess.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    No kiddin'. Damn. You really<br>
    think there's money in those<br>
    things?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Isn't that what makes America<br>
    great?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To what are you referring?</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Man rides into town in his<br>
    pajamas... wins a grub stake at<br>
    a poker table and turns it into<br>
    a horseless carriage and makes<br>
    a million bucks. That's America.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (concerned at the<br>
    conclusion)<br>
    Perhaps I have given you an<br>
    erroneous impression...</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Some day my ship's gonna come<br>
    in...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have a ship?</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Oh sure... and it's fulla gold...<br>
    I'm just biding my time til it<br>
    gets here... raising a stake any<br>
    way I can... I've been a newsie,<br>
    cut fish at a cannery, I've even<br>
    been an oyster pirate...</p>

  <p>69 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is a considerable spectrum<br>
    of occupations.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Can't stay in one place too<br>
    long... I'm always looking for<br>
    the angle, you know... say, maybe<br>
    you and I could go into business<br>
    selling your horseless<br>
    carriage... you invent 'em, I<br>
    sell 'em... I can sell anybody<br>
    anything, whattaya say?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe your plan is a bit<br>
    premature.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Keep it in mind though. Well,<br>
    I better get back...</p>
  <p> He starts to leave and the young man suddenly remembers<br>
    the newspaper in his back pocket.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    I forgot! I got you something<br>
    at the bakery on Third.</p>
  <p> He sets the paper down on the desk by Data, unrolling<br>
    it to reveal the pastry inside.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Jack.</p>
  <p> Data starts to pick out some coins to pay him back, but<br>
    the young man brushes it off.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    It's on me... partner.</p>
  <p> And EXITS. Data reaches over to make an adjustment on<br>
    the phaser housing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> The newsprint and pastry are slightly in his way, so he<br>
    picks up the edges of the paper and starts to slide it<br>
    aside -- WHEN SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE. DATA STOPS<br>
    DEAD, STARING AT THE NEWSPAPER.</p>
  <p>70 CLOSE ON THE PAPER</p>
  <p> A caption reads: &quot;Literary Reception Announced.&quot; Above<br>
    the words is the hostess' face. IT'S GUINAN. And it's<br>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>72 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO VICTORIAN HOME - DAY</p>
  <p> To establish.</p>
  <p>73 INT. BALLROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> An elegant reception. About two dozen well-dressed<br>
    19th-century society people are chatting in small<br>
    groups. A single narrow TABLE holds drinks and<br>
    canapes.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS (o.s.)<br>
    The eminent scientist, Alfred<br>
    Russell Wallace, has revived the<br>
    theory that Earth is at the center<br>
    of the stellar universe.</p>
  <p>74 ON THE GENTLEMAN</p>
  <p> who from the white hair and suit, bushy eyebrows, large<br>
    Cuban cigar, and soft Southern drawl is unmistakably<br>
    SAMUEL CLEMENS, a.k.a. MARK TWAIN. There are a couple<br>
    of people at the side, listening, but from this angle,<br>
    we don't see to whom he is primarily directing his<br>
    comments.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (continuing))<br>
    This distinguished natural<br>
    philosopher has reaffirmed our<br>
    planet as the only habitable globe<br>
    in the Heavens. A world<br>
    constructed, furthermore, for the<br>
    sole benefit of man.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He's gotten a lot of folks excited<br>
    about the notion.</p>
  <p>75 INCLUDE GUINAN</p>
  <p> dressed in 19th-century costume, but with a couple of<br>
    exotic touches (as though she were royalty from a<br>
    far-flung island).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Mister Clemens, why do I suspect<br>
    you're not one of them?</p>
  <p> Her comment generates easy SMILES from Clemens and the<br>
    others. Clemens is witty, charming -- but deeply<br>
    cynical.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Your suspicions, Madam Guinan,<br>
    are undoubtedly based upon your<br>
    keen observational skills. Now<br>
    if you'll permit me, I'll continue<br>
    my character assassination<br>
    unimpeded.</p>
  <p> Everyone laughs.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Please do.</p>
  <p> Clemens takes a big puff on his cigar.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    According to our best geologic<br>
    estimate, the earth is<br>
    approximately one hundred million<br>
    years of age. Perhaps it is less,<br>
    perhaps more.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Perhaps a great deal more.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Indeed. But regardless, it is<br>
    ancient in the extreme. Now,<br>
    geology also tells us that Man<br>
    himself has existed for but a<br>
    microscopic fraction of those<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> Clemens blows a big puff of cigar smoke into the air.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Curious, isn't it, that the world<br>
    got by for such a great long while<br>
    with no Humans around to take up<br>
    space?<br>

  <p>75 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> CLEMENS (cont'd)<br>
    I suppose Mister Wallace and his<br>
    supporters would say the world<br>
    needed all that time to prepare<br>
    everything for our illustrious<br>
    arrival.</p>
  <p> Clemens reaches out and casually takes an OYSTER canape<br>
    off the plate of a GENTLEMAN standing near. He appears<br>
    to study it carefully...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (re: the canape)<br>
    The oyster alone probably required<br>
    fifteen million years to come out<br>
    just right...</p>
  <p> Everyone laughs as he pops the canape into his mouth.<br>
    A beat and Guinan gives him a sly smile.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    And if the Earth isn't alone...<br>
    If there are millions of<br>
    inhabited planets in the<br>
    Heavens...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Quite my point. Man becomes a<br>
    trivial creation, does he not?<br>
    Lost in the vastness of the cosmic<br>
    prairie, adrift on the deep ocean<br>
    of time. A single one among<br>
    countless others.</p>
  <p> Clemens appears pleased with himself. Guinan casually<br>
    shrugs.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Then again, someone might say a<br>
    diamond is still a diamond -- even<br>
    if it is one among millions. It<br>
    still shines as brightly.</p>
  <p> Touch&#142;. A beat as Clemens studies her for a moment,<br>
    then smiles.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Indeed, someone might say that,<br>
    Dear Lady. If someone thought<br>
    the Human race were akin to a<br>
    precious jewel.</p>
  <p> Clemens puffs the cigar and lets out the smoke.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But this increasingly hypothetical<br>
    someone would not be me.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles.</p>
  <p>76 ON THE ENTRYWAY - FAR ACROSS THE ROOM</p>
  <p> where Data has just ENTERED, wearing the fine clothes<br>
    of a 19th-century gentleman. He pauses, scanning the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN (o.s.)<br>
    Good afternoon, sir.</p>
  <p> Include the DOORMAN, a large man appropriately dressed,<br>
    holding a GUESTLIST. The man eyes Data, reacting<br>
    momentarily to his skin color, but then taking it in<br>
    stride.</p>
  <p> Data shoots his cuffs, as if confident in his new role.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good afternoon. I would like to<br>
    speak to Guinan.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    (re: guestlist)<br>
    And you are... ?</p>
  <p> Data's confidence suddenly flags as he realizes there's<br>
    a list.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> The man checks the list.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    Mister Data... Could it be under<br>
    another name?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know...</p>
  <p> The Doorman is hesitant about possibly offending a<br>
    misplaced invitee.</p>

  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    I... can't seem to find you on<br>
    our guest list, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am a personal friend.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    Madam Guinan has discovered many<br>
    personal friends since the<br>
    newspaper announcement. But if<br>
    you're not on the guest list,<br>
    there's nothing I can do.</p>
  <p> Data will not be denied, begins to move inside...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is urgent that I see her...</p>
  <p> The Doorman tries to block his way...</p>
  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    -- Sir, if you don't leave this<br>
    house immediately, I will send<br>
    for the police.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is an excellent idea. I will<br>
    wait for them inside.</p>
  <p> Data STRIDES STRAIGHT into the party. The Doorman<br>
    grabs onto him, but is dragged along like a rag doll by<br>
    Data's android strength.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>77 ON GUINAN AND COMPANY</p>
  <p> still enjoying the conversation.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN (o.s.)<br>
    Sir! Please!</p>
  <p> Guinan and Clemens and the others turn toward the<br>
    noise.</p>
  <p>78 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> as he approaches them, dragging the Doorman behind him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Guinan, I must speak with you<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Data stops in front of her. She reacts... looks at him<br>
    without an ounce of recognition.</p>
  <p> DOORMAN<br>
    (out of breath)<br>
    Forgive me, madam... He's stronger<br>
    than he looks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Guinan)<br>
    I am sorry about the disruption,<br>
    but he did not believe me when<br>
    I told him we were friends.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    &quot;We?&quot; Meaning you and me? Have<br>
    we met, Mister...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Guinan looks completely blank. Data reacts -- SHE<br>
    DOESN'T KNOW HIM.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. We... were on a ship<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles, trying to socially defuse the situation,<br>
    as well as find out who this strange man is. Clemens<br>
    is keenly observant.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I've certainly done my share of<br>
    travelling. What ship?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FIVE 51-52. </p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Is that a clipper ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a starship.</p>
  <p> Guinan REACTS -- suddenly she knows she's dealing with<br>
    an alien like herself. But she also is acutely aware<br>
    of the need to maintain appearances.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    A starship? What registry would<br>
    that be?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Mister Data. Of course.<br>
    (to Clemens)<br>
    Excuse us, but we have so much<br>
    to catch up on...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Guinan quickly hurries Data OFFSCREEN. Clemens is left<br>
    with his hand in the air. He reaches up for his cigar<br>
    and takes a long puff, staring in the direction the<br>
    pair disappeared, a look of intrigued suspicion on his<br>
    face...</p>

  <p>81 ON DATA AND GUINAN</p>
  <p> as Guinan pulls him past the partygoers and around<br>
    a door.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Let me guess. My father sent you.<br>
    Well, you tell him I've still got<br>
    a lot more listening to do --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- I was not sent by your father.</p>
  <p> A beat; Data realizes that she doesn't know who he is,<br>
    but decides he has no choice.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Circumstances demand that I take<br>
    you into my confidence. I require<br>
    your assistance.</p>
  <p> A pause, then Data spills the beans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am from the future.</p>
  <p> Guinan reacts with surprise.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Is this some kind of a joke?</p>
  <p> She stares at his guileless face.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No, you don't look like the joking<br>
    type.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. I am from the<br>
    twenty-fourth century, where you<br>
    and I serve together on the same<br>
    starship.</p>
  <p> Guinan lets this sink in for a moment. Accepts it, for<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Why do you need my help?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our ship encountered a species<br>
    who appear to be threatening 19th-<br>
    century Earth. I investigated,<br>
    and was inadvertently pulled into<br>
    their temporal vortex.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I saw your photograph in the<br>
    newspaper, I assumed you had<br>
    joined me from the future. I know<br>
    your species is long-lived --<br>
    but I did not realize you had<br>
    visited Earth so long ago.</p>
  <p> Data suddenly NOTICES SOMETHING behind Guinan --</p>
  <p>81A A TENDRIL OF SMOKE</p>
  <p> wafting up from behind the door. Data and Guinan look<br>
    from the smoke to each other.</p>
  <p>82 FOLLOW DATA AND GUINAN</p>
  <p> as they step around the corner...</p>
  <p>83 INCLUDE CLEMENS</p>
  <p> inches away from them, the big cigar firmly in hand.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Eavesdropping is by no means a<br>
    proper activity for a gentleman.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Nonetheless, the deed is done...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>83 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OFF the look between Data and Guinan -- he's heard<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p>84 EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit above the planet.</p>
  <p>85 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Geordi, Worf and Beverly... all<br>
    participate in the preparation of the field... there is<br>
    a variety of technical gear with them... one three-foot-<br>
    high generator with controls and readouts, three<br>
    two-foot-high relay stations akin to a small satellite<br>
    receiver... Geordi wields a tricorder pinpointing the<br>
    perimeter...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Here...</p>
  <p> Worf sets down a generator expertly... aims it at<br>
    Crusher and Riker about twenty yards away...</p>
  <p>86 BEVERLY AND RIKER</p>
  <p> are doing roughly the same exercise... Beverly with<br>
    the tricorder...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The triolic waves end... right...<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> Riker sets up a relay station, aligns it with Worf...</p>
  <p>87 GEORDI</p>
  <p> has moved to join Troi against the rockface... who has<br>
    already set up another relay... Geordi checks it with<br>
    his tricorder...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's fine, Counselor...</p>
  <p> As he moves to meet Worf against a parallel section<br>
    of rockface who is setting up the last relay station...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>88 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard MATERIALIZES... the away team reacts...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How soon will you be ready?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we are, Captain...</p>
  <p> Geordi goes to the generator and hits a panel, an<br>
    optical flash passes between the generator and the<br>
    three relays and disappears... the area is not a<br>
    perfect square...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The subspace field is established.</p>
  <p> He looks at Riker for further instructions... Riker is<br>
    beginning to worry about the captain's unexpected<br>
    arrival... if it means he wants to be here for this, he<br>
    has a big problem with that...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd feel more comfortable if you'd<br>
    monitor us from the ship, captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have reason to believe my<br>
    presence on this mission is<br>
    imperative.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Imperative?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Worf, you will report to<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... as security officer, my<br>
    place is by your side.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The security of the Enterprise<br>
    is of paramount importance,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Yes, sir.<br>

    Worf to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER OFFICER COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (not pleased)<br>
    Beam me up.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER OFFICER COM VOICE<br>
    Stand by.</p>
  <p> Worf DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> Riker accepts the inevitable. Geordi is holding a<br>
    modified tricorder...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (for Picard's benefit)<br>
    I've modified this tricorder to<br>
    interface with the subspace<br>
    generator... It should allow me<br>
    to control the phase<br>
    discrimination... assuming it's<br>
    going to work at all...<br>
    (off Picard's nod)<br>
    I'll need everyone within the<br>
    field...</p>
  <p> Everyone passes between the relays... another optical<br>
    flash as they pass through the invisible line...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Adjusting for synchronic<br>
    distortion... point-zero-zero-one...</p>
  <p> And with each count, there is a continuous lighting<br>
    change... slowly being bathed in a blue light...</p>

  <p> And as the blue hue increases, now figures begin to<br>
    APPEAR...</p>
  <p>89 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a group of ALIENS in reclining positions on the ground,<br>
    arranged loosely in a circle... each of them is<br>
    silver-gray, a vaguely humanoid shape with very round<br>
    heads, no facial features to speak of... except a<br>
    blowhole where the forehead might ordinarily be... in<br>
    their center, built into the ground, is a TRANSLUCENT<br>
    HOLDING CHAMBER, glowing and flashing from within (like<br>
    a light ball spinning inside). On the side of the<br>
    chamber is a techno-organic, nipplelike projection.<br>
    Periodically, the chamber DISPENSES an energy segment<br>
    from its lower recesses... and as it emerges one of<br>
    the aliens on a rotating basis sucks it into his<br>
    blowhole...</p>
  <p>90 THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reacts... a beat as the aliens continue to ignore<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why can we see them when they<br>
    can't see us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The phase displacement might not<br>
    bring us far enough into their<br>
    perceptual range.</p>
  <p>91 PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves up close to look at one... it ignores him...<br>
    keeps sucking energy...</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    A life-form... ?</p>
  <p>92 TROI AND RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> move to the translucent chamber... the lights continue<br>
    to flash from within... moving around, darting... and<br>
    again, once in awhile, one is dispensed out the bottom<br>
    and disappears into an alien blowhole... Troi is<br>
    getting strong feelings now... she is overwhelmed with<br>
    the power of the emotions she feels... and she can't<br>
    help raising one hand to the chamber and gently<br>
    touching it...</p>
  <p> A tear rolls down her cheek...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. There is no life here...<br>
    what I have sensed is only an<br>
    imprint, an echo from the last<br>
    moment of life... Human life...<br>
    they all died in terror...</p>
  <p> There is a sonic boom... a bright light and they react,<br>
    turn to see...</p>
  <p>93 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two more aliens arriving through a hole of swirling<br>
    white light... one carries a canister... the other<br>
    a glowing, snakelike object... the noise is<br>
    deafening...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - REV. 4/07/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>94 THE AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> surrounded by the swirling wind, now bathed in the<br>
    combination of blue and white light. (They are far<br>
    enough away to avoid being sucked in like Data was.)<br>
    They react to the sight of the newcomer aliens...</p>
  <p>95 THE ALIENS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> move to the transparent chamber. One of them<br>
    attaches the canister to the nipplelike projection<br>
    on the chamber's side... new segments enter the tube<br>
    from the canister... and the chamber gets brighter...</p>
  <p>96 THE AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> watches in horror... over the din --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My God... they're delivering more<br>
    of them... for the others to...<br>
    ingest...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reacts with surprise<br>
    to something she sees)<br>
    Will, look at what he's<br>

  <p> as it twists in the alien's hands... and opens a mouth<br>
    revealing itself to be something akin to a snake...<br>
    and it struggles to escape but the alien grips it<br>
    harder...</p>
  <p>98 THE OTHER ALIEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> removes the canister from the holding tank and they<br>
    move back to the white light and are drawn in...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow&quot; - 4/06/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>99 RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> looks to Picard... who exchanges a look with the others<br>
    and with a nod, the captain leads the way to the<br>
    anomaly... as they move closer with grim determination<br>
    on their faces, they enter into the force... and<br>
    disappear into the white light... which twists itself<br>
    up and disappears... and without a freeze frame... we<br>
