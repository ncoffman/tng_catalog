  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45400.3.<br>
    Two days ago, Starbase<br>
    Five-one-four lost contact with<br>
    the research vessel Vico, which<br>
    was sent to explore the interior<br>
    of a Black Cluster. We are<br>
    en route to investigate.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF, ENSIGN FELTON at the conn.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN FELTON<br>
    Captain, we are entering sector<br>
    nine-seven.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I am picking up massive<br>
    gravitational fluctuations...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take us out of warp, Ensign.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN FELTON<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Ensign Felton touches the panel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Black Cluster is in visual<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/14/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INCLUDE SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to the awesome spectacle. A huge,<br>
    black bending of space, seemingly an immense lens-like<br>
    cloud, dotted throughout by tiny pulsars -- miniature<br>
    stars that blink on and off like lighthouses or<br>
    fireflies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's find that ship. Full sensor<br>
    sweep, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (touching panel)<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker indicates the cluster.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's quite a sight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    One of the most ancient formations<br>
    in the galaxy.</p>
  <p> Data looks up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have located the Vico. The<br>
    vessel appears to be adrift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's see it.</p>
  <p> Data touches the console.</p>
  <p> The screen image shifts, and is replaced by a closer<br>
    view: a mid-sized spacecraft, its hull sheared off in<br>
    several places, hanging motionless against the starry<br>
    background.</p>
  <p>4 RESUME</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to the sight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/16/91 - TEASER 3-3A. </p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nothing, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Damage report, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    The outer and inner hulls have<br>
    been breached. Decks seven<br>
    through twelve are exposed to<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set up a translink to their<br>
    computer core. Let's see what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> Data tries a few commands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot, sir. The emergency<br>
    bulkheads on that deck are in<br>
    place. Our linkup signal cannot<br>
    penetrate them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Structural status, Commander.</p>
  <p> Data hits a few controls on the console, looks at the<br>
    results.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stress readings indicate<br>
    considerable pressure on the<br>
    transverse supports.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it stable enough for an away<br>
    team?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    Yes, sir. But the risk of<br>
    structural collapse is high.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Have transporter room one maintain<br>
    a lock on each member of your<br>
    away team.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/17/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    I want you out of there at the<br>
    first sign of trouble.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, Captain.<br>
    (to conn)<br>
    Ensign, take us to fifteen<br>
    thousand meters.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN FELTON<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (heading for door)<br>
    Data, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Riker continues toward the turbolift, as Data gets out<br>
    of his chair and joins him.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard, staring at the wreckage.</p>
  <p>5 INT. VICO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and Geordi MATERIALIZE in a corridor-like<br>
    chamber that has a couple of science consoles and small<br>
    monitors against the wall. Data is carrying a small<br>
    suitcase-sized, boxlike device. The corridor has been<br>
    HEAVILY DAMAGED.</p>
  <p> Support beams are crashed through the ceiling, wall<br>
    panels are exposed -- it looks like one false step will<br>
    bring it all crashing down. When the away team moves,<br>
    it is with great caution and awareness of their<br>
    treacherous surroundings. They simultaneously spot<br>
    a couple of bodies partially exposed beneath the<br>
    rubble. Data takes out his tricorder and aims it<br>
    toward the bodies -- but it only confirms what they<br>
    already knew. The away team exchanges glances.</p>
  <p> Upon seeing the consoles, Data and Geordi start toward<br>
    them -- suddenly a structural member shifts in the<br>
    wall. The away team freezes. There is a metallic<br>
    groan, a slight shake. And everything is again still.<br>
    Data and Geordi again head for the consoles. One<br>
    monitor is dead. The other is lit up, flickering,<br>
    displaying a computer graphic of a graviton wave field.<br>
    They touch the controls on both panels but nothing<br>
    changes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: dead monitor)<br>
    This station is inoperable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/14/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: his console)<br>
    This one's stuck in a feedback<br>
    loop.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's try to tap directly into<br>
    the computer core.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There should be an ODN junction<br>
    along here somewhere...</p>
  <p> They all start scanning the area. Geordi spots a<br>
    promising panel against the wall.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This looks like a good<br>
    possibility...</p>
  <p> He reaches down to take hold of the panel --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Careful, Geordi. You don't want<br>
    to pull out the wrong brick...</p>
  <p> Carefully, Geordi removes the panel -- revealing the<br>
    fiber optic trunk within.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Data brings over the device. Sets it three feet in<br>
    front of the ODN trunk and touches a control.</p>
  <p> A LASER type beam shoots out of the box, connecting to<br>
    the trunk. Data tweaks the controls and the beam<br>
    changes color.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off colors)<br>
    Core transfer is engaged.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at the instrumentation on the device.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/17/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exchange protocol verified.<br>
    (takes reading)<br>
    The files seem to be intact. Some<br>
    of them, anyway.</p>
  <p> WEAK VOICE<br>
    Is somebody there... ?</p>
  <p> All three react. Riker indicates the transfer device.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Stay here.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> He motions &quot;follow me&quot; with his head. Riker and Data<br>
    cautiously move to the end of the damaged corridor and<br>
    around the corner.</p>
  <p>6 INT. SCIENCE SHIP CHAMBER - ON TIMOTHY</p>
  <p> a boy of ten. Trapped beneath a fallen bulkhead in an<br>
    even more heavily damaged area. He looks up at Data<br>
    and Riker -- panic on his face.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Are my parents alright?</p>
  <p>7 RESUME RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> OFF their reactions.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is facing the crippled Vico, the Black Cluster<br>
    in the background.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. A<br>
    young boy, shielded from our<br>
    initial sensor scans, has been<br>
    discovered alive by the away team.<br>
    The degree of damage to the Vico<br>
    is making our rescue attempt<br>
    difficult...</p>
  <p>9 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, Ensign Felton.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Transporter room one, can you lock<br>
    onto him?</p>
  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Hutchinson at the controls.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    And transport directly to<br>
    sickbay?</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    (to com)<br>
    I'll try, Captain...<br>
    (doubtful)<br>
    But there's a lot of shielding<br>
    to pull him through.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>11 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Picard to Crusher.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay here, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Standby for emergency transport.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir. Crusher out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Picard to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p>12 INT. VICO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are standing by. Riker is crouched<br>
    down next to the trapped boy. Timothy appears almost<br>
    numb with fright.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Is the boy ready, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to boy)<br>
    Everything's gonna be okay...</p>
  <p> A beat. The boy doesn't answer. But he nods his head<br>
    almost imperceptibly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touching combadge)<br>
    Ready, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    At your signal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Aye, Captain.</p>
  <p> Riker again looks at the boy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Alright... here we go...</p>
  <p> Riker straightens up, backs away from the fallen<br>
    bulkhead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The boy begins to DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>12A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly watches as the boy MATERIALIZES in and out on<br>
    a bio-bed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Hutchinson works the controls. A few seconds go by...<br>
    Hutchinson shakes his head.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    (to com)<br>
    The lock is holding. I just can't<br>
    resolve the matter stream. Not<br>
    with all that victurium alloy in<br>
    the way.</p>
  <p>13A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> As Beverly watches the boy completely DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p>14 INT. VICO</p>
  <p> The boy MATERIALIZES back in place.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker. You'll have to<br>
    get him out into the corridor.</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a glance with Data and Geordi.</p>
  <p> All three of them look at the bulkhead trapping the<br>
    boy. They glance up at the structural beams that are<br>
    in turn braced against the bulkhead. It all looks<br>
    heavy as hell -- and extremely unstable.</p>
  <p> Riker indicates the bulkhead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's gotta weigh over a ton,<br>
    Data. Can you move it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. However, that may<br>
    initiate the collapse of the<br>
    surrounding supports. I recommend<br>
    that you and Geordi return to the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> A beat. Riker reluctantly nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed.<br>
    (turning)<br>
    La Forge...</p>
  <p> They both head back toward the open corridor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>15 TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi MATERIALIZE on the transporter pad.<br>
    Beverly is standing near the transporter chief.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I'm locked onto Commander Data<br>
    and the boy, sir. I'll energize<br>
    as soon as they've cleared the<br>
    bulkheads.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keys combadge)<br>
    Whenever you're ready, Data.</p>
  <p>16 INT. VICO</p>
  <p> Data is standing next to the trapped boy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Yes, Sir.</p>
  <p> He crouches next to the boy, who stares at him,<br>
    wide-eyed, puzzled to see him up close, amazed at what<br>
    Data seems to be attempting.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    You're gonna lift that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Then I will carry you to<br>
    the corridor. We will transport<br>
    back to the Enterprise from there.<br>
    Do you understand?</p>
  <p> The boy is still amazed.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    How can you pick up something so<br>
    heavy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am an android. My strength is<br>
    many times that of a human.</p>
  <p> A beat as Data considers an appropriate way to reassure<br>
    the frightened boy -- recalls Riker's words.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Everything is going to be... okay.</p>
  <p> Data puts one hand and shoulder to the bulkhead,<br>
    leaving the other free.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/24/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will count to three.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One... two... three...</p>
  <p> Everything happens at once:</p>
  <p> -- with his android strength, Data forces the bulkhead<br>
    upwards. The boy scrambles free, falling to the floor.</p>
  <p> -- a second structural member collapses as a result of<br>
    the action.</p>
  <p> -- Data drops the bulkhead, spins, scoops the boy into<br>
    the air and dashes back toward the opposite corridor.</p>
  <p>17 DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> shoots into the open corridor, boy under his arm,<br>
    tapping his combadge with his free hand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Energize!</p>
  <p> He and the boy DEMATERIALIZE -- a piece of the ceiling<br>
    falls right through them.</p>
  <p>18 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and the boy MATERIALIZE, standing on the floor.</p>
  <p>19 INCLUDE BEVERLY AND AN N.D. NURSE</p>
  <p> Timothy looks up from the security of Data's shoulder,<br>
    still in shock from the experience. He stares at the<br>
    unfamiliar faces watching him. Timothy buries his head<br>
    into Data's shoulder.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's reaction.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>19A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The wrecked Vico hanging near the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. A<br>
    thorough search of the Vico has<br>
    revealed no additional survivors.<br>
    Troi has begun the process of<br>
    counseling the boy in regard to<br>
    the tragedy.</p>
  <p>20 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Timothy is on his back on a diagnostic bed, eyes open.<br>
    His hand is still gripping Data's -- the boy clearly<br>
    refuses to let go. Timothy has an edgy look in his<br>
    eyes, bordering on panic. Beverly and Troi are<br>
    standing next to Data.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (in a rush)<br>
    We were in the Black Cluster.<br>
    I don't know where they came<br>
    from... but they had a big ship<br>
    -- they kept shooting at us. Then<br>
    they beamed over. They had purple<br>
    helmets on and phaser rifles.<br>
    I saw them. But they didn't see<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> He runs out of steam. Beverly checks the diagnostic<br>
    reading above the bed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gently)<br>
    You're safe now, Timothy. You're<br>
    going to be alright.</p>
  <p> Timothy gives her a blank look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You must be hungry. Would you<br>

    Counselor, I must join Commander<br>
    La Forge in engineering. If you<br>
    will excuse me --</p>
  <p> Data attempts to gently retrieve his hand -- but the<br>
    boy grips it ever the more tightly.</p>
  <p> Data stops in his tracks. He and Troi look at Timothy.<br>
    The boy averts his eyes. A beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Timothy, would you like Data to<br>
    stay a little bit longer?</p>

  <p> OFF Data's head tilt reaction.</p>
  <p>21 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The away team's device is dumping its datastream into<br>
    the computer console -- as before, the LASER makes the<br>

  <p> Geordi is showing Picard a graphic of the wrecked Vico<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: datastream)<br>
    How much longer until we can<br>
    access their logs?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Less than an hour.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. He reaches toward the console and touches<br>
    a command.</p>
  <p>22 CLOSE ON: COMPUTER MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the boy's father?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ship's second officer.<br>

    He was most likely on the bridge<br>
    when it was exposed to space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grimly)<br>
    Most likely...</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard studies the diagram, imagining what<br>
    it must have been like. OFF the look on his face.</p>

  <p> as Timothy's much smaller hand slowly loosens its grip,<br>
    slipping out of Data's palm.</p>
  <p>25 WIDEN TO INCLUDE - INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Timothy is on his back in bed, eyes closed, having<br>
    obviously just fallen asleep. Data takes a careful<br>
    step back, joining Troi and Beverly, who are standing<br>
    nearby.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    You've got some work cut out for<br>

  <p> Troi nods her agreement with that assessment. Beverly<br>

    still watching the boy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p>27 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are at their consoles.</p>
  <p>28 ON GEORDI'S SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Alphanumeric bits of information flash by on the two<br>
    screens. There appear to be major chunks of data<br>
    missing -- blocks of blank space.</p>
  <p>29 RESUME (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This isn't good. I think whatever<br>
    hit the Vico set up an E-M pulse<br>
    that flashed through their<br>
    computer banks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (agreeing)<br>
    Nearly eighty-three percent of<br>
    the records have been lost.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And all of their sensor logs.<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    Let's use what we got from our own<br>
    sensors. Call up the structural<br>
    analysis and the surface scans...</p>
  <p> Data complies by keying in the appropriate commands<br>
    -- the alphanumeric data is replaced by an Okudagram<br>
    of the wrecked Vico. As they study the information...</p>

    Geordi, as a child, did you ever<br>
    experience a traumatic event?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're wondering about Timothy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>

  <p> Geordi thinks for a moment, remembering.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was trapped in a fire once, when<br>
    I was five -- before I got my<br>
    VISOR. It only took about two<br>
    minutes before my parents found<br>
    me and pulled me out. And nobody<br>
    got hurt. But I tell you -- that<br>
    was the longest two minutes of<br>
    my life. And it was more than<br>
    a month before I would let my<br>
    parents get out of earshot. I<br>
    absolutely needed to know they<br>
    were there.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Timothy no longer has that kind<br>
    of support.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p>30 INT. SCHOOL</p>
  <p> A TEACHER, male, late-twenties, is slowly walking past<br>
    a beautiful painting of a multitiered, very<br>
    alien-looking temple. He is carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    (reading)<br>
    Dara and her brother found<br>
    themselves in the land of Tagas...</p>
  <p> The teacher continues his slow pacing, passing a young<br>
    girl, aged ten, who is following along in a PADD of<br>
    her own.</p>

  <p> He continues past several other children, also reading<br>
    silently along in their PADDs.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;No children will be tolerated<br>
    within the Great Kingdom.&quot;</p>
  <p>31 INCLUDE TIMOTHY</p>
  <p> who is working with a 24th-century equivalent of an<br>
    erector set, adding to a large, three-foot-high model<br>
    of the edifice depicted in the painting at the front<br>
    of the classroom. He's ignoring the teacher entirely,<br>
    his PADD on the floor next to him. His manner is<br>
    intensely focused.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When Dara saw the proclamation,<br>
    she just laughed, saying &quot;How<br>
    magnificent a ruler, to be<br>
    frightened by the likes of us... &quot;</p>
  <p> The teacher pauses near Timothy, sees that the boy is<br>
    still working on his model.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Timothy, we're done with sculpture<br>
    for now.</p>
  <p> Timothy somewhat manically adds another piece to the<br>
    temple.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (re: the model)<br>
    It's not finished.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    We'll come back to it next period.<br>
    Why don't you pick up your<br>
    mythology book and follow along?</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    But it's not finished...</p>
  <p> Timothy increases his efforts -- which result in a<br>
    somewhat lopsided addition to the model. It only makes<br>
    him more agitated.</p>
  <p> The teacher looks at him for a moment, then glances<br>
    across the room to a large window. Follow his gaze<br>
    to --</p>
  <p>32 TROI</p>
  <p> who is watching the classroom from behind a large<br>
    observation window. The look on her face says &quot;What<br>
    can I do for this boy?&quot;</p>
  <p>33 INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE STATION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are showing Picard a monitor that<br>
    displays a surface scan diagram of the Vico. All three<br>
    are standing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Magnetic residual analysis<br>
    confirms that the Vico was<br>
    attacked inside the Black Cluster.<br>
    The graviton wave fronts pushed<br>
    the ship to where we found it.</p>
  <p> Picard is looking at the information on the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No sign of phaser burns on the<br>
    hull.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir. The torsional stress<br>
    levels point to a disrupter-style<br>
    weapon.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data touches the console and a color pattern overlay<br>
    appears on the graphic.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fracture points indicate that the<br>
    energy burst came from a range<br>
    of less than three thousand<br>
    meters.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a strategy consistent with<br>
    a cloaked vessel. Romulan. Or<br>
    Klingon... But we're quite a<br>
    distance from either of their<br>
    territories.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Breen have outposts in this<br>
    sector. The attack on the Vico<br>
    is consistent with their battle<br>
    tactics -- and their level of<br>
    technology.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods in confirmation.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard thinks about this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But what would they have been<br>
    doing inside the Black Cluster?</p>
  <p> It's a question none of them can answer. Picard starts<br>
    to walk along the back perimeter of the bridge, Data<br>
    and Geordi walking with him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The boy described a boarding<br>
    party, with helmets and phaser<br>
    rifles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A boarding party?</p>
  <p> A turbolift door opens and Troi steps out, within<br>
    earshot.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't think that's likely,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- motions Troi over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> Troi does so as they pause near the turbolift. Picard<br>
    nods to Geordi to continue.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There was absolutely no evidence<br>
    of anybody coming on board the<br>
    Vico. We would have found a<br>
    transporter field trace. Or if<br>
    somebody had used the entry<br>
    ports, we would have found an<br>
    electrostatic differential in<br>
    the docking latches. We didn't.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Maybe he's got an active<br>
    imagination.</p>
  <p> Picard half turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or he's lying.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/17/91 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If he is lying, I haven't been<br>
    able to sense it. Perhaps his<br>
    level of emotional trauma is too<br>
    high.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why wouldn't he tell us the truth?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's still in shock... it's hard<br>
    to know what's going on in his<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll check the sensor readings<br>
    again... but I'm almost sure we<br>
    won't find anything.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS into the turbolift. Data starts to peel<br>
    off toward his post -- but Troi stops him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data -- stay a moment.</p>
  <p> Data complies. Troi turns to Picard. A beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain -- I think we should ask<br>
    Data to spend some time with<br>
    Timothy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm worried about his<br>
    behavior... And what you've just<br>
    told me doesn't make me feel any<br>
    better. Data, you're the only<br>
    one Timothy's reached out to...<br>
    because you rescued him. We can<br>
    use your relationship with him<br>
    to help his recovery.</p>

  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would Timothy also be more<br>
    inclined to tell Data the truth<br>
    about what happened?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's a possibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Mister Data, proceed with the<br>
    child as Counselor Troi suggests.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and enters the ready room. Data turns to<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly how shall I proceed,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Just be with him. You're a<br>

  <p>35 INT. TIMOTHY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Timothy is sitting alone at a table in his foster<br>
    parents' quarters. Timothy is using the &quot;erector set,&quot;<br>
    building the Dokkaran temple he was working at in the<br>
    classroom.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He works too quickly, agitated, and the result is a<br>
    model that looks pretty sloppy.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. Timothy glances up. Doesn't answer<br>
    it. He turns back to the model. The CHIMES ring<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>

    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Yeah.</p>
  <p> Data steps inside. He reacts to Timothy's tabletop<br>
    creation, moving closer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I see you are attempting to<br>
    recreate the Dokkaran temple of<br>
    Kural-Hanesh.</p>

  <p> Timothy is hyperenthused.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>

    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Data is about to speak then catches himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you wish a frank evaluation?</p>
  <p> Timothy nods. Data considers for a moment, arrives at<br>
    his honest opinion, innocently offered --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It lacks the harmony that<br>
    characterized this particular<br>
    temple and Dokkaran culture in<br>

  <p> Timothy looks crushed.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    You hate it.</p>
  <p> He knocks over the tower-like structure he was<br>
    struggling with at the top of the scene. Data reacts.</p>

  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    No emotions? You mean you can't<br>

    Goodbye.</p>
  <p> Data turns and Timothy watches him enter the turbolift.<br>
    When it closes behind him, Timothy maintains his stare<br>
    for a few silent beats. FOLLOW him back inside.</p>
  <p>39B INT. TIMOTHY'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Timothy turns back to the model city, considers it for<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> He turns away and goes to the mirror hanging on a<br>
    nearby wall.</p>
  <p> He stares at his reflection. Then makes his face<br>
    utterly impassive.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (Data-like)<br>
    I am designed to exceed human<br>
    capacity...</p>
  <p> He tilts his head in imitation of Data, watching the<br>
    result in the mirror until he gets it right. Again,<br>
    his voice is an imitation of Data's.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That is correct...</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>40 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise holding in space near the destroyed<br>
    Vico, the Black Cluster in the background.</p>
  <p>41 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf, Troi. Data is in<br>
    mid-report, on a nearby monitor is a graphic of the<br>
    interior of the Black Cluster -- a dully glowing<br>
    center, a dozen bright points scattered through it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Black Cluster was formed<br>
    almost nine billion years ago when<br>
    hundreds of protostars collapsed<br>
    in close proximity. The resulting<br>
    gravitational forces are violent<br>
    and highly unpredictable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To get anywhere near the center,<br>
    we'll have to push through the<br>
    gravitational wavefronts -- just<br>
    like the science vessel was<br>
    designed to do. I've adjusted<br>
    our shields accordingly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The gravitational forces will<br>
    affect sensor accuracy. Detecting<br>
    an enemy vessel will be difficult.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe that's what happened to the<br>
    Vico -- they didn't see anything<br>
    coming until it was too late.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this, turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has the boy volunteered any<br>
    further information?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. But we have an appointment<br>
    in less than an hour.</p>
  <p> Picard nods then glances at the graphic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If there's any possibility of<br>
    getting more from him, I'd like<br>
    you to pursue it.</p>
  <p> Troi nods. Picard glances toward the graphic display.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Regardless, we need to continue<br>
    our investigation.<br>
    (beat, informing the<br>
    room)<br>
    We'll enter the cluster at<br>
    oh-seven-hundred tomorrow morning.<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> As they rise to exit...</p>
  <p>42 OMITTED</p>
  <p>43 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi stops at Timothy's door and touches the panel --<br>
    we hear the CHIME. A few moments later, the door<br>
    slides open, revealing Timothy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Timothy. Are you ready<br>
    to go?</p>
  <p> Timothy is wearing similarly styled and exactly the<br>
    same color clothing as Data does. His face is<br>
    impassive and android-like (his hair is still in his<br>
    own style and color). Unlike the agitated condition<br>
    he exhibited earlier, the boy is the essence of calm<br>
    self-control.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Yes, Counselor. I am ready.</p>
  <p> The boy's uniform and his calm, almost formal tone of<br>
    voice are not lost on Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How are you feeling, Timothy?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/14/91 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I am functioning within<br>
    established parameters.</p>
  <p> Troi considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/18/91 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Established parameters? You<br>
    sound like Data.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (of course)<br>
    I am an android.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see... Well. Let's go for our<br>
    walk, shall we?</p>
  <p> Timothy makes a characteristically Data-like head tilt.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    That would be acceptable.</p>
  <p> OFF Troi's face -- she's in for a ride.</p>
  <p>44 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi and Timothy are sitting at a table.</p>
  <p> A WAITER stands close by, waiting to take his order.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (to waiter)<br>
    Androids do not need to eat or<br>
    drink.</p>
  <p> A second waiter passes by with a tray full of<br>
    attractive desserts -- Timothy reacts, then turns back<br>
    to his waiter.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    However, sometimes we like to<br>
    taste things.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A Tamarin frost, please.</p>
  <p> Timothy turns.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Would you like anything,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT THREE 32A.</p>
  <p>45 INCLUDE TROI</p>
  <p> taking this all in, cautiously trying to deal with this<br>
    new development.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, I'm fine, thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> The waiter turns and leaves.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So... you're no longer a Human?</p>
  <p> He cocks his head in pure Data fashion.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I'm an android.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When did this happen?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I've always been an android.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's it like... being an<br>
    android?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I am designed to exceed human<br>
    capacity both mentally and<br>
    physically. But I do not<br>
    experience emotions.</p>
  <p> A beat as this registers on Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You don't? No emotions at all?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> OFF Troi as she wonders how to deal with this.</p>
  <p>46 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An android.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - REV. 10/16/91 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know it sounds unusual - but<br>
    it is understandable.<br>
    Technically, it's called<br>
    enantiodromia. Conversion into<br>
    the opposite. Timothy went from<br>
    Human to machine. From being<br>
    emotional to being emotionless.<br>
    But the underlying trauma is still<br>
    there. He's just found a new way<br>
    to repress it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will this behavior last?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    As long as he needs it to.<br>
    Timothy is rebuilding his identity<br>
    as best he can. The android<br>
    persona is only one step along<br>
    the way. When he becomes stronger<br>
    and more sure of himself, it<br>
    should drop away naturally.</p>
  <p> Picard considers her words.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assume this is not a time to<br>
    confront him about what happened<br>
    to his ship.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not yet. The best thing we can<br>
    do right now is to let Timothy<br>
    take us where he wants to go.<br>
    We should support the process<br>
    -- even encourage it.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data -- I'd like you to<br>
    make Timothy the best android he<br>
    can possibly be.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's head-tilt reaction.</p>
  <p>47 INT. TIMOTHY'S QUARTERS - ON TIMOTHY</p>
  <p> doing a head tilt that EXACTLY MATCHES the one Data<br>
    just performed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 34A.</p>
  <p>48 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> standing next to him. Timothy is sitting in a chair,<br>
    the wall mirror behind him -- like an impromptu barber<br>
    shop set-up. Data is holding a small comb and is<br>
    eyeing Timothy's hair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data attempts to put the comb to use, but the boy's<br>
    android-like head tilts make it difficult -- it's like<br>
    trying to hit a moving target. After a few attempts --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Timothy, your head movements<br>
    are... counterproductive. Can<br>
    you be still?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    But you do it.</p>
  <p> Data reacts with a head tilt. Timothy mirrors it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The servo-mechanisms in my neck<br>
    are designed to approximate Human<br>
    movements.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I did not realize the effect was<br>
    so... distracting.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I like it.</p>
  <p> Timothy does a couple more quick head tilts -- Data<br>
    puts a hand on the crown of his head, holding him<br>
    suddenly still.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Data, are there any other androids<br>
    in Starfleet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I am the only one.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    How come you're not captain?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My service experience does not<br>
    yet warrant such a position.</p>
  <p> Timothy nods. He's silent for a moment.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Data, what's the scariest thing<br>
    that ever happened to you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fear is a quality that I do not<br>
    possess.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Because it's an emotion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    But what if you had a nightmare?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have never had a nightmare.<br>
    I do not require sleep.</p>
  <p> Timothy is silent. Data continues adjusting the boy's<br>
    hair for a moment, then realizes something.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Timothy, are you having...<br>
    disturbing dreams?</p>
  <p> Timothy doesn't answer right away. There's a sense<br>
    that he's hiding something -- even from himself. He<br>
    looks straight at Data.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I do not require sleep.</p>
  <p> Data looks at him for a moment -- he isn't going to get<br>
    anything further out of him for now. Data finishes one<br>
    last touch-up on the hair, then lifts the chair and<br>
    turns it barber style to face the mirror on the wall.</p>
  <p>49<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    50</p>
  <p>51 ANGLE - THE MIRROR</p>
  <p> where we can see Timothy looking at his reflection --<br>
    and his perfectly executed Data-like hairstyle. Data<br>
    is visible over his shoulder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is it satisfactory?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>52 RESUME</p>
  <p> as Timothy looks at Data with tremendous admiration,<br>
    then glances back at the mirror.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    It's perfect.</p>
  <p>53 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Timothy are striding along the corridor, in<br>
    perfect step, their arms swinging in unison. It looks<br>
    for all the world like there's a new android on board.</p>
  <p>54 INCLUDE TWO N.D. CREWMEMBERS</p>
  <p> approaching from the opposite direction. As Data and<br>
    Timothy pass by, the crewmembers simultaneously stop<br>
    and do a double-take.</p>
  <p>55 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Data and Timothy are sitting side by side with their<br>
    legs hanging off the side of a diagnostic bed.</p>
  <p> Beverly is running a hand-held, medical scanning DEVICE<br>
    over the length of Timothy's arm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Transfer circuits are functioning<br>
    properly.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Within established parameters?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> Beverly continues with the scan, moving it over his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Input processing, pattern<br>
    recognition... all within<br>

  <p>56 OMITTED</p>
  <p>57 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data and Timothy are each sitting at an easel, paint<br>
    brush in hand, dabbing brushstrokes against their<br>
    respective canvasses. Timothy's set-up is an exact<br>
    duplicate. Data's painting is a tranquil landscape,<br>
    we can't quite see what Timothy's working on...</p>
  <p> Timothy looks sleepy, like they've been going non-stop<br>
    all day. Data is as fresh as always.</p>
  <p> The boy glances down at his palette and paint jars.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I ran out of red ochre.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may use mine.</p>
  <p> Data hands him a jar.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Timothy can't help but let loose with a huge yawn.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps you should return to your<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    I'm fine.<br>
    (in explanation)<br>
    The servo-mechanisms in my mouth<br>
    are designed to approximate human<br>
    movements.</p>
  <p> Data considers for a moment. Then attempts a yawn. It<br>
    doesn't look too convincing. But Timothy doesn't want<br>
    to discourage him.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Not bad.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Data looks over at the boy's easel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Hero Worship&quot; - 10/8/91 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>58 INCLUDE TIMOTHY'S PAINTING</p>
  <p> It looks exceedingly violent -- we can't actually see<br>
    a spacecraft ripped apart, but we can sense the feeling<br>
    of one. The boy's trauma is making its presence<br>
    known...</p>
  <p> Data reacts to the painting.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is very... expressive.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> A beat. Timothy doesn't seem to be aware of what his<br>
    own work suggests.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is your painting representative<br>
    of something?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    It's just a painting.</p>
  <p> Timothy again yawns. Data thinks for a moment -- this<br>
    is not his area of expertise and he knows to tread<br>
    lightly...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Timothy, you understand that you<br>
    may speak with me about anything<br>
    you wish -- any subject.</p>
  <p> Timothy again yawns.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>

  <p> Data watches him for a moment, but nothing further is<br>
    forthcoming.</p>

  <p> turning back to his own easel, applying a few<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    This is great. How's yours?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The complex polysaccharides, in<br>

    produces an unusual combination<br>
    of texture and efforvescence.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    But how does it taste? Is it<br>
    good?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not capable of &quot;tasting&quot; in<br>
    the manner which you describe.<br>
    I can analyze the composition of<br>
    a dessert and make comparative<br>
    conclusions about its possible<br>
    effect on the human palate.<br>
    However, I neither like it, nor<br>
    dislike it...</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Oh. I didn't realize that.</p>
  <p> Data indicates the dessert.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have often wondered what it must<br>
    be like... to have one's mouth<br>
    &quot;water&quot; in anticipation of the<br>
    arrival of a confection... Or<br>
    to feel the pleasure I have<br>
    observed in people as they consume<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> Timothy considers this for a second, staring at his<br>

  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    Why? We're stronger and smarter<br>
    than Humans... we can do more than<br>
    they can.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I cannot take pride in my<br>
    abilities. I cannot take<br>
    pleasure in my accomplishments.</p>
  <p> Timothy has begun scratching a little place in the<br>

    this task as though it were the most important thing<br>
    in the world.</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    But we never feel bad, either...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would gladly risk feeling bad<br>
    at times... if it meant that I<br>
    could also taste my dessert.</p>

    Explanation, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The phaser energy was reflected<br>

    It is similar to the phenomenon<br>
    distorting the sensor signals.</p>

    This reflection phenomenon --<br>
    would it have the same effect on<br>
    a disruptor-style weapon?</p>

    Yes, sir. Disruptors would be<br>
    ineffectual.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    all look toward Data for the explanation.</p>

    we induced harmonic<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Precisely. And that is also what<br>
    destroyed the Vico. When Timothy<br>
    remembered similar procedures<br>
    aboard his ship, I initiated an<br>
    analysis of shield output to<br>
    wavefront amplitude and discovered<br>
    a correlation.</p>

    more appropriate to a child.</p>
  <p> A little girl -- his &quot;lab partner&quot; -- hands him a small<br>
    piece of metal and he takes it, attaching it to the<br>
    apparatus they're building. He's fitting in -- but<br>
    still seems very tentative and fragile.</p>

  <p> The boy looks away, almost embarrassed. Data picks up<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> TIMOTHY<br>
    You probably thought I was pretty<br>
    silly. When I had my hair like<br>
    yours and everything.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    On the contrary, it is said that<br>
    imitation is the highest form of<br>
    flattery. I was... flattered.</p>
