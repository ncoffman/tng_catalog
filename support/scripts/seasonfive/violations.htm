  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45429.3.<br>
    While on a mapping survey of<br>
    sector two-two-one-three-nine, we<br>
    are conveying a delegation of<br>
    Ullians to Kaldra Four. These<br>
    telepathic historians conduct their<br>
    research by retrieving long-forgotten<br>
    memories.</p>
  <p>2 CLOSE ON KEIKO</p>
  <p> With her face fixed in concentration, she struggles to<br>
    grab hold of an elusive memory.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's a chipped cup, off-white...<br>
    with a crack in it... I can see<br>
    it... but I can't remember<br>
    anything else about it...</p>
  <p> TARMIN (o.c.)<br>
    When you see it... do you hear<br>
    any sounds?</p>
  <p> The man's voice is gentle, coaxing. Keiko tries to<br>
    concentrate.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    No... I don't think so... wait,<br>
    yes...</p>
  <p> She tilts her head slightly, as though trying to hear<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Humming...<br>
    (as if listening)<br>
    Someone's humming...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TARMIN (o.c.)<br>
    A woman.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Yes... but I don't know who it<br>
    is...</p>
  <p> CUT to reveal we are --</p>
  <p>3 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Keiko sits at a table opposite a large,<br>
    powerfully-built alien named TARMIN, 50's, whose eyes<br>
    are closed as he concentrates on the same images as<br>
    Keiko. Tarmin's hand touches his head. A<br>
    white-haired female alien, INAD, quite a bit older than<br>
    Tarmin, sits beside him. A third alien, JEV,<br>
    Tarmin's attractive son, 30's, stands and observes.<br>
    Also observing are RIKER, GEORDI, and BEVERLY, who seem<br>
    to be fascinated by this process.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Try to touch the cup.</p>
  <p> Keiko looks at him, unsure what he means, then closes<br>
    her eyes and tentatively reaches out her hand.</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT</p>
  <p> touching the side of the cup, then running a finger<br>
    along its rim, reaching a sharp-edged chip and abruptly<br>
    pulling back. (NOTE: These cuts are all inserts, very<br>
    close-up, revealing nothing of the surrounding.)</p>
  <p>5 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Keiko pulls her hand back as well, opens her eyes.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It has a sharp edge where it's<br>
    chipped.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Is there anything inside the cup?</p>
  <p> Keiko concentrates, trying to see the image.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    A liquid... dark...</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Like tea...</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT</p>
  <p> quickly dipping two fingers inside the cup.</p>
  <p>7 OMITTED</p>
  <p>8 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's not hot...</p>
  <p> Keiko puts the same two fingers into her mouth, as if<br>
    to taste the liquid, then scrunches up her nose.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Bitter...</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    There's something else in the<br>
    cup...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Yes... with a wooden handle...</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    A spoon...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    No... It's more delicate than<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Reach for it.</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 A CHILD'S HAND - INSERT</p>
  <p> reaching for the wooden handle, pulling out a JAPANESE<br>
    INK BRUSH.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>10 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's a brush! An ink brush.</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 THE INK BRUSH - INSERT</p>
  <p> in the child's hands, one holding the brush, the other<br>
    touching the bristles.</p>
  <p>12 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I hear that humming again.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Keep listening to it, and hold<br>
    out the brush. See if someone<br>
    takes it from you.</p>
  <p> Keiko extends her hand, as if it held a brush in it.</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>13 AN OLD WOMAN'S HAND - INSERT</p>
  <p> reaching for the brush, taking it by the handle.</p>
  <p>14 RESUME KEIKO</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's Obachan! My grandmother.<br>
    She's doing brush writing. I<br>
    remember it now!</p>
  <p> Tarmin opens his eyes, pleased with himself.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    She used that cup for cleaning<br>
    the brush, and it was my job to<br>
    fill it with water and bring it<br>
    to the table.<br>
    (remembering)<br>
    I'd sit beside her and watch the<br>
    most beautiful characters come<br>
    from that brush. And the whole<br>
    time, she'd be humming to herself.<br>

  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO (cont'd)<br>
    (smiles, amazed)<br>
    It's like it was yesterday.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You remember such vivid details...<br>
    it's remarkable.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    For years I've seen that old cup<br>
    in my memory... but I could never<br>
    recall what it was or why it was<br>
    important.<br>
    (to Tarmin)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    You're very welcome, young lady.</p>
  <p> He looks around at the group.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Perhaps someone else would care<br>
    to try?</p>
  <p> Inad and Jev react to this, uncomfortable with Tarmin<br>
    &quot;soliciting&quot; the group. Tarmin fixes his eyes on<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    You, madam... you're thinking of<br>
    that first childhood kiss.<br>
    Wouldn't you like to remember<br>
    more about it?</p>
  <p> Beverly is amazed by this, but Jev remonstrates his<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Father, you know you're not<br>
    supposed to probe someone's<br>
    memories unless they've given you<br>
    permission.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    You're right... but sometimes with<br>
    a beautiful woman -- I can't help<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> There is good-natured laughter at this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - 10/25/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    What about you, Commander? Any<br>
    memories you feel like digging<br>
    up?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    None that I'd want to share with<br>
    an audience.</p>
  <p> Geordi and the others grin at this; Keiko stands.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I'd better be going... it's<br>
    getting late.</p>
  <p> The group disperses, Riker and Geordi moving to the<br>
    exit, some of the others moving off in little groups.<br>
    CAMERA drops off on Jev, who stands alone, an enigmatic<br>
    look on his face.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    Reports of the Ullians' remarkable<br>
    feats have piqued my interest.<br>
    I have invited the senior staff<br>
    to a Captain's Dinner in honor<br>
    of our guests.</p>
  <p> INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data walking along a corridor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is perplexing to me that the<br>
    Ullians' ability to retrieve<br>
    memory is so sought after. If<br>
    an event is important enough to<br>
    be recovered... why would it have<br>
    been forgotten?</p>
  <p> Geordi ponders how to explain this.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's not quite the same for us<br>
    as it is for you, Data. You<br>
    record every second of every event<br>
    in your life...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And if you want to recall any one<br>
    of those seconds, you just access<br>
    the proper memory circuit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My understanding of the Human<br>
    brain suggests that the process<br>
    is the same for you.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    Each memory is encoded in chains<br>
    of molecules, and when you want<br>
    to retrieve it, you simply access<br>
    the proper RNA sequence.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, yeah, that's true...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then in what way is it different?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sometimes... There are memories<br>
    we just can't tap into. For<br>
    instance... I have no recollection<br>
    of what I did on my last birthday.<br>
    Birthdays are important<br>
    occasions... you'd think I'd<br>
    remember how I spent the day.<br>
    But I can't even remember where<br>
    I was.</p>
  <p> They reach a turbolift, and the doors open.</p>
  <p> INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> as they enter.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Deck two. On the other hand --<br>
    I remember everything about the<br>
    time I got my first pet... a<br>
    Circassian cat. I was eight. I<br>
    remember how funny he looked...<br>
    how excited I was... it's as if<br>
    it happened last week.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps you remember the pleasant<br>
    memories and forget the unpleasant<br>
    ones?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, not really. Sometimes the<br>
    bad memories are the most intense<br>
    of all.</p>
  <p> Data finds this all very difficult to follow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE 7B.</p>
  <p>B14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would seem there is no<br>
    predictable pattern to Human<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> Geordi is grateful for this summation -- any summation<br>
    -- of an inexplicable subject.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It would seem.</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open and they EXIT.</p>
  <p>15 INT. DINING ROOM</p>
  <p> An elegant dinner is being served to the Enterprise's<br>
    guests of honor: Tarmin, the delegation leader, Inad,<br>
    and Jev. PICARD, Riker, WORF, DATA, Geordi, TROI, and<br>
    Beverly are present.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    This &quot;library&quot; of ours has been<br>
    in the planning stages for years<br>
    -- a collection of the retrieved<br>
    memories of races from many<br>
    different star systems --</p>
  <p> We sense that Jev is sincere and idealistic about this<br>
    dream; Tarmin, however, wants center stage, and<br>
    interrupts him. Jev subsides, though he's annoyed.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    What my son means to say is --<br>
    we think of ourselves as<br>
    &quot;archaeologists of the mind.&quot; We<br>
    believe that the history of a<br>
    world is contained in the personal<br>
    experiences of its people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Rather like the ancient oral<br>
    historians of Earth.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Exactly. The library we propose<br>
    will be a vast storehouse of these<br>
    individual memories.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds like quite a project...<br>
    how long will it take to finish<br>
    your studies on Kaldra?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT ONE 7C.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    Many months. We have been working<br>
    for years, and have surveyed only<br>
    eleven planets in eight star<br>
    systems.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    But it's our way of life. We<br>
    wouldn't want to do anything else.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (with feigned innocence)<br>
    Captain, Mister Tarmin gave us<br>
    a demonstration of his abilities<br>
    this afternoon. It's fascinating.<br>
    Perhaps you'd like to resurrect<br>
    some memories...</p>
  <p> She smiles sweetly as Picard gives her a piercing look.<br>
    Tarmin, oblivious to the teasing, leaps in, eager to<br>
    pick up on the opportunity.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    I'd be happy to probe your<br>
    recollections, Captain. Most<br>
    people find it an enjoyable<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure. However, I don't think<br>
    I'm a particularly good candidate<br>
    --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gently twisting)<br>
    I'm sure you'd be ideal. And you<br>
    must have some intriguing<br>
    memories...</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    We won't be on your ship for long.<br>
    This might be your last<br>
    opportunity...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, well...</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    (gently admonishing)<br>
    Tarmin, you mustn't influence<br>
    people. They must come to you<br>
    willingly.</p>
  <p> Tarmin shrugs. We sense that he enjoys his work,<br>
    likes to show off a little -- to the consternation of<br>
    the more serious, straight-laced Ullians.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    I have found... over the years...<br>
    that there are many who want the<br>
    experience of memory retrieval...<br>
    but who need some encouragement<br>
    in order to come forward.</p>
  <p> He turns and looks around; his eye falls on Worf.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    You, Mister Worf? I would love<br>
    to explore Klingon memories.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons do not allow themselves<br>
    to be &quot;probed.&quot;</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    There is nothing to fear...</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    (cautioning)<br>
    Father...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not fearful.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Commander La Forge... you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think so. Thanks anyway.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    I have rarely encountered such<br>
    squeamish people! Doctor<br>
    Crusher... Commander Riker... ?</p>
  <p> Tarmin's pushiness is becoming a bit much; Troi comes<br>
    in to smooth things over.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mister Tarmin, are all Ullians<br>
    able to read memories?</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    No, my dear. The technique<br>
    requires special training. It<br>

    It takes years of study. Tarmin<br>
    is the most proficient of our<br>
    group.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    Once Jev spent two days with a<br>
    contingent of elderly Gentons.<br>
    He couldn't get a thing from them.<br>
    I worked with them for one hour<br>
    and recovered a missing fragment<br>
    of the Gentonian trade wars.</p>
  <p> Jev colors at this public put-down. He's had enough.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> He rises and heads for the exit. There's an awkward<br>
    pause.</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    (smoothly)<br>
    Exactly how long will it be before<br>
    we reach Kaldra, Captain?</p>
  <p> Over the next, Troi rises and follows Jev.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Four days, eleven hours, sir.</p>
  <p>16 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Jev is standing outside a turbolift as Troi rounds the<br>
    corner.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Jev...</p>
  <p> He turns and sees her. Lets out an exasperated sigh.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    I'm sorry. I'm being rude.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, not at all...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    My father finds it amusing to<br>
    demean me in public. I reach the<br>
    point where I don't want to hear<br>
    any more.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's not easy having an<br>
    overbearing parent. Believe me,<br>
    I know how you feel.</p>
  <p> He looks at her curiously.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Oh, yes... I was told you were<br>
    an empath.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can't read Ullians. But, I<br>
    do know a certain Betazoid mother<br>
    who is a great deal like your<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> Jev smiles at this, relaxing a bit in this sharing of<br>
    grievances. The turbolift doors open and they ENTER.</p>
  <p>16A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Deck eight. I've learned to<br>
    remind myself that my mother and<br>
    I are two separate individuals.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Deck sixteen. And have you had<br>
    much success with this approach,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> She takes a breath as if to speak... stops herself,<br>
    ponders for a moment... then looks right at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... but I keep reminding myself.</p>
  <p> He laughs, she does, too... she's managed to ease his<br>
    overreaction to his father's self-aggrandizement. The<br>
    turbolift stops and the doors open.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Good night.</p>

  <p>16A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Good night, Counselor. And thank<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him and EXITS the turbolift.</p>

  <p>18 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi is getting ready for bed. She is wearing a<br>
    nightgown, and brushes her hair in front of the<br>
    mirror.</p>

    us?</p>
  <p>22 RESUME TROI (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> who once again shakes off the memory, a bit jarred by<br>
    it. She walks to the replicator.</p>

  <p> Poker chips tumbling to the floor.</p>
  <p>24 RESUME TROI (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> who takes her cocoa, increasingly disturbed by the<br>
    intrusion of these memory flashes. She sits down to<br>
    sip her cocoa, then gasps slightly and falls back<br>
    against the cushions. Something overwhelming is<br>
    happening to her.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - MEMORY FLASHBACK</p>
  <p> (NOTE: There should be some special visual treatment<br>
    of the flashback sequences in order to differentiate<br>
    them from the present... a filter... maybe sepia<br>
    tones... Linear versions of the flashback scenes are<br>
    included at the end of the script.)</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker are cleaning up after a poker party.<br>
    The mood is easy, jocular. Troi has neither the<br>
    costume nor the hairdo she wears today. She is<br>
    collecting poker chips, trying to stack them into their<br>
    container. They tumble from her hands and onto the<br>
    floor. She laughs and kneels down; Riker does the<br>
    same.</p>
  <p> JUMP CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 TROI AND RIKER</p>
  <p> She's lying on the floor, he's bending over her, faces<br>
    close.</p>

    Have you stopped thinking about<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> JUMP CUT TO:</p>
  <p>27 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> They reach for some poker chips... Riker covers her<br>
    hand with his. They freeze that way for a moment, then<br>
    Troi looks up and sees him looking at her intently.</p>

  <p>28 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - IN THE PRESENT</p>
  <p> She sits on her couch, eyes frozen, as though in a<br>
    trance, reliving this erratic memory.</p>
  <p>29 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - MEMORY FLASHBACK</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker are sitting on the floor; he strokes<br>
    her hair.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Imzadi... we can't... not when<br>
    we're serving on the same ship...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have you stopped thinking about<br>
    us? Just answer that...</p>

  <p> JUMP CUT TO:</p>
  <p>31 ANOTHER ANGLE (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> Riker lowers her backward onto the floor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't stop thinking about you...</p>
  <p> Riker bends closer to her... their lips only inches<br>
    apart...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... don't...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have you stopped thinking about<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> There is no answer. Their lips meet, and all the<br>
    resistance in Troi is gone. They kiss tenderly but<br>
    with ardor...</p>
  <p> Suddenly the grip of his hands on her arms tightens...<br>
    he's more forceful...</p>

  <p> He is demanding, urgent. It's hard to resist...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, Will --</p>
  <p> She finally pushes him away, and stares at him -- but<br>
    instead of Will Riker, she sees ---</p>

  <p> Troi has fallen back on the couch, staring at nothing.</p>
  <p>34 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - MEMORY FLASHBACK</p>
  <p> as Jev lowers her onto her back; she struggles against<br>
    him in horror.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, don't...</p>
  <p> JEV (o.c.)<br>
    I can't stop thinking about<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Troi turns to see --</p>
  <p>35 JEV (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> standing to the side, observing Troi with the other<br>
    image of himself, staring at them sadly as though<br>
    almost embarrassed to be viewing them. (He is in his<br>
    costume.)</p>
  <p> Troi looks with horror from one to the other, still<br>
    struggling to escape. The first Jev holds her tight<br>
    and tries to kiss her.</p>

  <p> Now Troi looks toward a different part of the room;<br>
    Jev has appeared there, still smiling his sad smile.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't do this... !</p>
  <p> JUMP CUT TO:</p>
  <p>37 JEV AND TROI</p>
  <p> as he lowers her onto her back, then holds her wrists<br>
    roughly and bends down to kiss her.</p>

  <p>39 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45430.9.<br>
    Counselor Troi has fallen into<br>
    a deep coma. After a thorough<br>
    examination, Doctor Crusher has<br>
    been unable to find any sign of<br>
    illness or infection.</p>
  <p>40 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi is unconscious, lying on a bio-bed. Picard and<br>
    Riker watch as DOCTOR MARTIN, an African-American<br>
    male, examines her with a tricorder. Beverly<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Any change, Doctor?</p>
  <p> MARTIN<br>
    No. I'm still getting unusual<br>
    neurotransmitter readings in the<br>
    diencephalon... but they might<br>
    be a result of the coma...</p>
  <p> He shuts off the tricorder and moves away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Can you bring her out of it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've tried standard revival<br>
    techniques... she doesn't<br>
    respond. Until I know what caused<br>
    this, I don't want to try anything<br>
    more extreme.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do we know what she was doing when<br>
    this happened?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - 10/25/91 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. She was found in her quarters<br>
    this morning when she didn't show<br>
    up for an appointment.<br>

  <p> BEVERLY (cont'd)<br>
    She was dressed for bed... but<br>
    the bed wasn't slept in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who was the last person to speak<br>
    with her?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She left the dinner last night<br>
    with one of the Ullians.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll talk to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll check the biofilter readings<br>
    from the Ullians' transporter logs.<br>
    It's possible they could still be<br>
    carrying some harmful organism.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, ask if they would<br>
    consent to examinations -- just<br>
    to be certain.</p>
  <p> Riker heads for the door. Picard turns back to look<br>
    at Troi... CAMERA pushes in on her beautiful face,<br>
    composed and still.</p>
  <p>41 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, scans the room, and sees Jev sitting<br>
    alone at a table. He approaches.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    May I join you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - 10/25/91 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Commander... of course...</p>
  <p> He looks at Riker curiously.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Something's wrong...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Counselor Troi is ill.</p>
  <p> Jev feigns both surprise and concern.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    I'm sorry to hear it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    More than ill... she's in a coma.<br>
    Doctor Crusher doesn't know what's<br>
    causing it or how to treat her.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    When did it happen?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Apparently some time last night.<br>
    That's why I wanted to talk to<br>
    you... you may have been the last<br>
    person to see her. Did you go<br>
    with her into her quarters?</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation as Jev eyes Riker.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Are you suggesting I behaved<br>
    improperly, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all... I'm just trying to<br>
    trace her steps.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    (tersely)<br>
    We talked briefly -- in a<br>
    turbolift. She got off at deck<br>
    eight. I did not go with her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised at the<br>
    defensiveness)<br>
    Jev -- I'm not accusing you of<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - 10/25/91 - ACT TWO 19A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> An uncomfortable moment passes. Riker tries again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did she mention feeling ill?</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    No. She seemed fine.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She has a wonderful sense of<br>
    humor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (letting that pass)<br>
    If you have no objection, Doctor<br>
    Crusher would like to examine you<br>
    and your group...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Jev is surprised at this.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    To what end?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She'd like to eliminate the<br>
    possibility that one of you might<br>
    be carrying some organism that<br>
    was harmful to Deanna.</p>
  <p> Jev regards him coolly. There is no warmth between<br>
    these two.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not implying that you've done<br>
    anything intentional. I am just<br>
    trying to get to the bottom of<br>
    a mystery...</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    We have nothing to hide. If you<br>
    wish to spend time examining us...</p>
  <p> He shrugs, as though the matter were of no import.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Fine. Thank you.</p>
  <p> He rises and heads for the door. As he leaves, Jev's<br>
    expression changes from benign condescension to a<br>
    controlled anger.</p>
  <p>41A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker approaches Troi's bed and sits on a stool. He<br>
    looks at her still, composed face for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Deanna... I don't know if you can<br>
    hear me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've heard doctors say that even<br>
    when someone's in a coma, they<br>
    may be able to hear when people<br>
    talk to them... that it might<br>
    even help stimulate the brain<br>
    and speed the healing...<br>
    (a beat, remembering)<br>
    In fact, I think you did that for<br>
    me once, when I was in pretty<br>
    bad shape...</p>
  <p> He takes a breath, feeling a little foolish talking to<br>
    an unconscious person, but more driven by his concern<br>
    for her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So I just thought... maybe it<br>
    would help to hear a friendly<br>
    voice...<br>
    (with a wry smile)<br>
    ... even if you don't know you're<br>
    hearing it.</p>
  <p> He takes a breath, looking for something to talk about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've been busy mapping the<br>
    sector... it's pretty routine.<br>
    So far the most unusual thing<br>
    we've seen is a binary star<br>
    system... I finished that<br>
    personnel review we were working<br>
    on... you can check it over when<br>
    you...<br>
    (a beat, as he realizes<br>
    it might not happen)<br>
    ... wake up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/25/91 - ACT TWO 21A.</p>
  <p>41A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He stops, afraid of losing control.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I miss you. So don't stay away<br>
    too long, okay?</p>
  <p> He half rises, putting his arms on the bed and leaning<br>
    over her (THE POSITION HE IS IN AT THE BEGINNING OF<br>
    SCENE 42). He stares down at her, as though willing<br>
    her to hear him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (o.c.)<br>
    Will... ?</p>
  <p> He does not look away from Deanna.</p>
  <p>42 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi is still deeply, peacefully in her coma. Riker<br>
    stands at the bed, staring down at her, concern etched<br>
    in his face. Beverly approaches.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Will... I promise I'll let you<br>
    know the minute she regains<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's nothing you can do here.<br>
    You're going to wear yourself<br>
    out...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's late... go to bed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's an order.</p>
  <p> He glances up at her, finally nods, and walks out.<br>
    She looks after him, worried.</p>

    Medical log, stardate 45431.7.<br>
    Commander Riker is the second<br>
    officer who has fallen into an<br>
    unexplained coma. I have examined<br>
    the Ullians and ruled out the<br>
    possibility that they carry a<br>
    harmful organism.</p>
  <p>67 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, and Worf.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I compared Deanna's brain scan<br>
    to one I took during her last<br>
    physical. There is a<br>
    difference... this time there's<br>
    a trace of electropathic activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Commander Riker?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I found the same pattern. If I<br>
    didn't know better, I'd think they<br>
    had Iresine Syndrome. It's the<br>
    only medical condition that would<br>
    produce that pattern.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is Iresine Syndrome?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A very rare neurological disorder<br>
    first diagnosed in the<br>
    twenty-third century. It's<br>
    characterized by an identical<br>
    electropathic residue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why discount the possibility<br>
    that it's responsible for their<br>
    comas?</p>

    Iresine is always accompanied by<br>
    a severely decreased histamine<br>
    count. Both Will and Deanna show<br>
    normal levels.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've asked Commander La Forge to<br>
    conduct a shipwide diagnostic<br>
    for any other agents which could<br>
    produce that electropathic<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Counselor Troi and Commander Riker<br>
    were in perfect health -- until<br>
    the Ullians got here.</p>
  <p> A beat as they acknowledge this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It would be wise to quarantine<br>
    the aliens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe it's premature to take<br>
    that kind of action. We have no<br>
    real evidence linking these comas<br>
    to the Ullians.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's true. But there is<br>
    something curious...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to her, questioning.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The electropathic residue I<br>
    discovered is located in the<br>
    thalamus. That's the area of the<br>
    cerebral cortex which involves<br>
    memory function.</p>
  <p> There is a moment as this sinks in.</p>

    the first time it's been suggested<br>
    that I might be responsible for<br>

    I mean no disrespect, sir. But<br>
    we are faced with an alarming<br>
    situation...</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    Why do you suspect us, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Suspect is perhaps too strong a<br>
    word. I am simply trying to<br>
    determine what has caused two of<br>
    my officers to fall into comas.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    You've already examined us...<br>
    we aren't carrying anything<br>
    harmful...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But in further study of the<br>
    victims, I noticed some abnormal<br>
    patterns in the area of the brain<br>
    which involves memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In light of your particular<br>
    telepathic abilities, it does<br>
    raise the question...</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    Captain... it's not our wish to<br>
    obstruct you. What would you<br>
    like?</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've spent two hours having a cozy<br>
    chat with the computer. I've<br>
    checked everything I can think<br>
    of -- any possible agent that<br>
    might cause that electropathic<br>
    pattern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would assume from the tone of<br>
    your voice that you were<br>
    unsuccessful.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Didn't find a thing.</p>
  <p> They have reached Beverly's office. As they ENTER --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And the Doctor's not gonna like<br>
    hearing that --</p>
  <p> They spot Beverly slumped over her desk. Geordi<br>
    quickly moves to her, checks her pulse while Data taps<br>
    his combadge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Emergency medical team to Doctor<br>
    Crusher's office immediately.</p>
  <p>91 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Geordi, and Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor Crusher had me working on<br>
    a shipwide diagnostic. I'd gone<br>
    to give her the results when I<br>
    found her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did your scans provide any<br>
    insights into these comas?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/22/91 - ACT FOUR 40A.</p>
  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    None. I checked and<br>
    cross-checked... they were just<br>
    dead ends.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We seem to have eliminated all<br>
    known factors that could have<br>
    caused the comas -- except for<br>
    the Ullians.</p>
  <p> Picard digests this, then --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, I want you to<br>
    investigate those eleven planets<br>
    the Ullians have visited. See<br>
    if there have been any reports<br>
    of unexplained comas.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the meantime, we must consider<br>
    restricting them to their<br>
    quarters. As a precautionary<br>
    measure...</p>

  <p>91 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If one of them is behind this...<br>
    will keeping telepaths in their<br>
    quarters prevent it from happening<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> Picard is well aware of the problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What else can we do? Station a<br>
    guard? Set up a force field?<br>
    I don't know if those would be<br>
    any more effective...</p>
  <p> MARTIN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here...</p>
  <p> MARTIN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir... Counselor Troi has regained<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges glances with the others -- this may<br>
    be a breakthrough.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p>92 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi sits in a bio-bed, talking with Martin and Picard.<br>
    She is struggling to recall what happened to her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's like waking up from a<br>
    nightmare... but not remembering<br>
    what it was about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the last thing you do<br>
    remember?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> There's a long beat as Troi thinks...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My hair... I was brushing my hair.</p>
  <p> There is a pause as she tries to go beyond that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And then... ?</p>
  <p> Troi struggles to take the next step, but finally<br>
    shakes her head in frustration.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know... just... waking<br>
    up here...</p>
  <p> She looks up at them, fragile and vulnerable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why do I feel so frightened? What<br>
    happened to me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We were hoping you could tell us.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How long have I been here?</p>
  <p> MARTIN<br>
    Three days.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    Three days... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were the first. The next day<br>
    Commander Riker fell into a<br>
    similar coma... and last night<br>
    -- Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> Troi is shocked and disturbed by this revelation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    What is going on here... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We aren't certain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It may be... that there is some<br>
    unusual effect produced by the<br>
    Ullians' telepathic activity.</p>
  <p> Troi sinks back on the bed, trying to absorb all this<br>
    startling information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm going to talk to them. In<br>
    the meantime, you're to stay here<br>
    and recuperate. And if you<br>
    remember anything about what<br>
    happened to you... let me know<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> He turns and EXITS. Troi is left with strange,<br>
    disturbing feelings that she can't even identify.</p>
  <p>93 INT. ULLIAN QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard with Tarmin, Inad, and Jev. Tarmin already<br>
    has a head of steam gathered; Picard is trying to<br>
    navigate these troubled diplomatic waters carefully.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    What are you suggesting, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That you voluntarily confine<br>
    yourself to quarters. At least<br>
    until we unravel this mystery.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    (offended)<br>
    We're to be prisoners?</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Father...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please don't think of it that way.</p>
  <p> He moves toward them, making his case.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>93 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have done everything we can<br>
    think of to explain these comas.<br>
    We've performed physical<br>
    examinations and neurological<br>
    scans... we have conducted a<br>
    shipwide diagnostic, looking for<br>
    viruses and parasites and<br>
    infestations...</p>
  <p> He stands before the Ullians, at the end of his rope.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have investigated every<br>
    possible cause we can imagine.<br>
    And we have found nothing --<br>
    nothing -- to explain the comas.</p>
  <p> He pauses a moment, eyeing them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The only variable we cannot<br>
    eliminate... is your presence<br>
    on this ship.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In light of these efforts, I ask<br>
    you to understand my request.<br>
    And to honor it.</p>
  <p> There is a silence in the room.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Captain... our history indicates<br>
    that we do not adversely affect<br>
    the people we contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know that.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Then... are you implying an<br>
    intentional assault?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am simply trying to consider<br>
    all possibilities.</p>
  <p> Jev regards Picard, thinking.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Surely you would give us the<br>
    chance to prove that we are<br>
    innocent?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/28/91 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>93 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that is possible, of course.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Then... I would propose doing a<br>
    memory probe of Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a surprised look.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    You've said she doesn't remember<br>
    what happened to her before she<br>
    lapsed into unconsciousness. I<br>
    could retrieve that memory...<br>
    There's a possibility it could<br>
    explain the coma -- and prove us<br>
    innocent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry. But I cannot subject<br>
    the Counselor to a potentially<br>
    dangerous procedure.</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    And I will not be a party to any<br>
    of these proceedings.</p>
  <p> Tarmin withdraws to another part of the room,<br>
    separating himself from the group. Inad steps forward.</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    Jev is making a reasonable<br>
    request, Captain. If we're to<br>
    be accused, surely we're entitled<br>
    to a defense.</p>
  <p> She walks to Picard, addresses him directly.</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    Tarmin did a memory probe on<br>
    another of your crew... Has she<br>
    suffered any ill effects?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> INAD<br>
    And neither will Counselor Troi.<br>
    Please... have as many people<br>
    present as you like to guarantee<br>
    her safety... but give us this<br>
    chance to vindicate ourselves.</p>
  <p> A pause as Picard considers.</p>

  <p> Geordi and Data working at separate science stations.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, that's it for Melina Two.<br>
    No unexplained comas during the<br>
    time the Ullians were working<br>
    there. We're striking out<br>
    everywhere.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have yet to receive<br>
    transmissions from the two planets<br>
    of the Nel system. Perhaps they<br>
    will show different results.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe...<br>
    (a thought)<br>
    Or maybe... we're not checking<br>
    for the right thing.</p>
  <p> He turns to his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Please clarify.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We didn't look into the comas<br>
    that were explained.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Why would we do that?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Remember what Doctor Crusher said<br>
    right after Counselor Troi became<br>
    unconscious? That it looked<br>
    exactly like Iresine syndrome<br>
    except for the histamine count?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/29/91 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>93B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe not every medical facility<br>
    is as careful as Doctor Crusher.<br>
    Maybe it's easier to give a quick<br>
    diagnosis to something than to<br>
    keep hunting for the real cause.</p>
  <p> Geordi keeps inputting.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are checking for instances<br>
    of Iresine Syndrome...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right... and correlating them with<br>
    visits by the Ullians --<br>

    Tarmin and his group was there.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I want to do it, Captain.<br>
    Something awful happened to me...<br>

    it was.</p>
  <p> Picard is reluctant in a protective way, but acquiesces<br>
    to her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> He backs off, and nods to Jev.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What would motivate someone like<br>
    your father to commit such an act?</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    I don't know. A perverse source<br>

  <p> There is silence at that remark, then Jev starts<br>

  <p> The door opens and Jev ENTERS. She rises and walks<br>
    toward him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Jev.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    We'll be reaching the starbase<br>
    soon. I wanted to say good-bye...<br>
    and to apologize again for my<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's no need... you're not<br>
    responsible for what he did.</p>
  <p> He gazes at her sadly for a moment.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Before all this happened... I had<br>
    hoped we might become friends.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We still can...</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    After what he's put you through?<br>
    Maybe you can forget... I'm not<br>
    sure I can.</p>
  <p> He reaches out, touches her face.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    You are so lovely...</p>
  <p> He pulls his hand away abruptly, moves away.</p>

  <p>104 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    I have to go. Good-bye.</p>
  <p> She is distressed by his sudden terseness. She doesn't<br>
    want him to feel guilty for what she believes is his<br>
    father's deed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Jev... you're upset. Would you<br>
    like to talk?</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> He is holding himself very still, as though resisting<br>
    some overpowering instinct.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You'd feel better if you did...</p>
  <p> Slowly, he turns to face her.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Why do you have to be so nice...<br>
    (closes his eyes)<br>
    So lovely...</p>
  <p> Jev puts his hand on his head in the memory-probe<br>
    fashion. Now it is Troi who looks distressed, a bit<br>
    disoriented.</p>

  <p> Poker chips falling to the floor.</p>
  <p>106 RESUME TROI AND JEV (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> She tries to shake off the memory.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What... what's happening... ?</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>107 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> Riker's arms lowering her to the floor.</p>

  <p>108 RESUME TROI AND JEV (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> She stares at him, a little dazed but realizing what's<br>
    happening.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's happening again...</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    You are so beautiful... so<br>
    fragile...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was you... it was always you...</p>
  <p> SUBLIMINAL CUT TO:</p>
  <p>109 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> Jev's arms lowering her backward -- holding her<br>
    tightly, hurting her.</p>
  <p> JEV'S VOICE<br>
    (distorted)<br>
    Have you stopped thinking about<br>
    us?</p>
  <p>110 RESUME TROI AND JEV (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> Struggling to maintain control, Troi reaches for her<br>
    combadge, but Jev grabs her wrist, stopping her, and<br>
    pulls it off. She tries to grab for it, but is<br>
    immediately assaulted by more images.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No...</p>
  <p>111 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> Jev stands holding the poker chips, smiling sadly.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - 10/25/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>113 JEV AND TROI (FLASHBACK)</p>
  <p> He holds her tightly, bending over her as she lies on<br>
    the floor.</p>
  <p> JEV<br>
    Imzadi...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No -- no --</p>

  <p>114 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (PRESENT)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No -- I won't let you!</p>
  <p> And, propelled by all her rage and desperation, she<br>
    LUNGES at him. She HITS HIM in the face, and Jev grabs<br>
    her wrists.</p>
  <p>115 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> as she tries to free herself, then KICKS HIM furiously<br>
    in the shins. Jev cries out and lets go; she PUNCHES<br>
    HIM in the ear.</p>
  <p>116 ANGLE ON JEV</p>
  <p> as, enraged, he charges her. He tries to grab her from<br>
    behind as she reaches for the PADD from her desk; she<br>
    struggles free and swings her arms in a wide arc,<br>
    HITTING HIM in the face with the PADD. He recoils only<br>
    briefly and GRABS HER firmly.</p>
  <p>117 TROI</p>
  <p> struggles, PUNCHING and KICKING as best she can,<br>
    lashing out at him, her fury preventing her from<br>
    yielding. All of her anger propels her, all of the<br>
    outrage she feels against this man who has violated<br>
    her.</p>
  <p>118 ANOTHER ANGLE - TOWARD DOOR</p>
  <p> as Worf, Data, and several SECURITY OFFICERS rush in.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Let go of her!</p>
  <p> Jev flings Troi away and charges Worf. He and Worf<br>
    scuffle, but Jev is no match for the powerful Klingon.<br>
    He is subdued and the security officers take him away.</p>
  <p>119 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> who has gone immediately to Troi, helped her to her<br>
    feet. She is out of breath and rubbing her hand, which<br>
    is sore from hitting Jev.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 11/5/91 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>119 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor, are you hurt?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... why... why did you come<br>
    here? How did you know?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We discovered two instances of<br>
    unexplained comas on Nel Three<br>
    while the Ullians were there...<br>
    but Tarmin was not part of the<br>
    group. A closer examination<br>
    revealed that only one Ullian was<br>
    present at all incidents of coma<br>
    -- Jev.</p>
  <p>119A ON TROI</p>
  <p> as she takes this in.</p>

  <p> traveling through space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45435.8.<br>
    Doctor Crusher and Commander Riker<br>
    regained consciousness while we<br>
    were en route to the Ullian home<br>
    world. The slow process of their<br>
    recovery has begun.</p>
  <p>122 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Troi, Riker, and Tarmin -- who has<br>
    lost his pomposity and braggadocio.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Violations&quot; - REV. 10/31/91 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>122 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    I have asked that the finest<br>
    physicians on my world meet with<br>
    you all upon our return... to help<br>
    you in your healing process.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They have been in contact with<br>
    us already. Thank you...</p>
  <p> TARMIN<br>
    It has been three centuries since<br>
    anyone was treated for this...<br>
    this form of rape. But there are<br>
    medical records from that era...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was a time of great violence<br>
    among my people... a time we<br>
    thought we had left far behind.<br>
    That this could happen now...<br>
    is unimaginable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Earth was once a violent planet,<br>
    too. At times, the chaos seemed<br>
    to threaten the very fabric of<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> He moves toward Tarmin, trying to offer comfort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Like you, we have evolved. We've<br>
    learned to find better ways to<br>
    handle our conflicts.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But no one would deny that a seed<br>
    of violence remains in every one<br>
    of us. The potential for it is<br>
    always there. We must learn to<br>
    recognize it... because that<br>
    violence is capable of consuming<br>
    each of us. Just as it consumed<br>
    your son.</p>
  <p> And as they all reflect on these somber thoughts --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
