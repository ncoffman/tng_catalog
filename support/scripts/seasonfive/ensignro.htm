    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ENTERPRISE BARBER SHOP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Close on PICARD in the barber chair, the barber's tools<br>
    working on his hair. Picard's face is unpleasant as<br>
    the BARBER chatters on.</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    ... there's a time when you want<br>
    to call a Romulan's bluff and<br>
    there's a time when you don't...<br>
    (beat, waiting for a<br>
    response, then... )<br>
    Wouldn't you say?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (trying to be polite)<br>
    Yes, well, one does not always<br>
    have the luxury...</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    You've got to choose your time<br>
    and place with them. True or<br>
    false?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    Whenever possible.</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    So, this time you were lucky.</p>
  <p> Picard starts to respond, then simply grunts.</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I suppose all's well that ends<br>
    well but if I had been in your<br>
    shoes...</p>
  <p> Picard frowns impatiently, glances in the mirror...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/25/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Well, it looks very nice,<br>
    Mot... that should suffice...</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    Hold on...</p>
  <p> He picks up a new tool and checks the sideburns...<br>
    trims one side...</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    (done)<br>
    ...there.</p>
  <p> ... and now he is facing Picard eye to eye...</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    I must tell you, Captain, Will<br>
    Riker was in for a trim<br>
    yesterday... and he agreed with<br>
    me a hundred per cent...</p>
  <p> Picard cocks an eyebrow at that one.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hits insignia, with<br>
    an edge)<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker reacts slightly to the tone of voice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry to interrupt. We're<br>
    receiving an emergency distress<br>
    signal from the Solarion Four<br>
    colony.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BARBER SHOP</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    Uh oh, right along the Cardassian<br>
    border...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/26/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Lay in a new course. I'm on my<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> He rises and silently acknowledges the barber and after<br>
    he exits, the barber shakes his head with concern,<br>
    turns to a colleague...</p>
  <p> BARBER<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    I told him we never should have<br>
    colonized that close to the<br>
    Cardassians...</p>
  <p> The other barber nods in agreement and...</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the turbolift. RIKER, DATA, WORF<br>
    and SUPERNUMERARIES on the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The signal ended abruptly at oh<br>
    four five five... unable to raise<br>
    them on subspace...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail them on upper and lower band<br>
    frequencies, Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've tried, sir. No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time to the Solarion system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Twenty-six minutes, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/25/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, satisfied, settles in his command<br>
    chair... glances at Riker...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand you've been<br>
    discussing alternative adversarial<br>
    engagement strategies with Mot.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    It would be more accurate to say<br>
    he was discussing them with me...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He's the best barber in<br>
    Starfleet... what can you do... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, receiving another signal from<br>
    a vessel leaving orbit of Solarion<br>
    Four... new frequency, low<br>
    band... audio only...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open the channel.</p>
  <p> Some crackle in the reception.</p>
  <p> MALE VOICE<br>
    This is the Bajorans. We claim<br>
    responsibility for the destruction<br>
    of the Federation colony on<br>
    Solarion Four. As long as we are<br>
    without our homeland, no one will<br>
    be safe in this sector.</p>
  <p> As the signal ends, push in on Picard and...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/19/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At a space station.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45076.3.<br>
    We have arrived at Lya Station<br>
    Alpha with survivors from Solarion<br>
    Four. Admiral Kennelly has<br>
    rendezvoused to discuss the<br>
    Bajoran terrorist attack.</p>
  <p>6 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Close on ADMIRAL KENNELLY, standing. Kennelly is a<br>
    younger man than Picard, more casual than your average<br>
    Admiral. He's not feeling at all well; has a headache<br>
    and a cold... the first thing he does when we cut to<br>
    him is sneeze...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Sorry...</p>
  <p> He pulls out a handkerchief and blows his nose.<br>
    Picard takes a step to a food replicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Ginger tea with honey, very hot.</p>
  <p> The replicator makes it in a cup. Picard brings it<br>
    over. They sit.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Ginger tea?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My Aunt Rebecca's cure for the<br>
    common cold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/19/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Common, hell... I picked this up<br>
    from the Cardassian liaison last<br>
    weekend. It's some damn virus<br>
    they've sic'ed on me.</p>
  <p> He inhales the steam from the tea first... his face<br>
    shows some relief...</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did the liaison have anything to<br>
    say about the attack?</p>
  <p> Kennelly sips some tea as he considers his answer a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    It's an old story for the<br>
    Cardassians. They've had<br>
    terrorist problems since they<br>
    annexed the Bajoran home world<br>
    forty years ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But in forty years, the Bajorans<br>
    have never attacked a Federation<br>
    target...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    A new militant splinter group has<br>
    broken away from the Bajoran<br>
    settlement camps. Leader's name<br>
    is Orta. Apparently he's willing<br>
    to do whatever he has to to get<br>
    attention...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And our response?</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    We're going to give him attention.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can't tell you how good this<br>
    feels on my throat...</p>
  <p> Kennelly puts the tea down, sighs... rises, massages<br>
    his head to relieve the pain...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - 7/18/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Listen, I'm the first to say that<br>
    the Bajorans deserve attention...<br>
    chased off their own planet by<br>
    the Cardassians, forced to wander<br>
    the galaxy, settling wherever they<br>
    can find room...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    On many worlds we've been to, they<br>
    are isolated, treated as<br>
    pariahs...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    The Federation has great sympathy<br>
    for their cause... but they're<br>
    not helping themselves with an<br>
    attack like this.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's what you have to<br>
    communicate to them.</p>
  <p> Picard studies his superior officer, knows there's<br>
    more...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That could be done through<br>
    diplomatic channels, Admiral...<br>
    what do you really want from us?</p>
  <p> Kennelly nods... takes a beat, then...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Find this terrorist leader,<br>
    Orta... get him back &quot;on the<br>
    reservation&quot;... any way you can.</p>
  <p> Picard blinks... that's a hell of an order... and it's<br>
    one he doesn't care for very much... he almost smiles<br>
    incredulously...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any way I can...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    The Federation has dozens of<br>
    settlements in that sector. We<br>
    can't allow the violence to<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/25/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what do I have to offer that<br>
    might persuade him to cooperate?</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    Amnesty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (not nearly adequate)<br>
    Admiral...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    ... and a promise that we will<br>
    immediately begin to address this<br>
    issue with the Cardassians...<br>
    quietly, behind the scenes, using<br>
    every legitimate means... the<br>
    Bajorans have to be patient...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They have endured generations of<br>
    sympathy and promises. I cannot<br>
    believe this Orta will be<br>
    satisfied with more of the same.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    It's your job to see that he is,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker with A TRANSPORTER OFFICER (COLLINS).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, have you approved the<br>
    transfer of a new officer to the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Negative...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - 7/18/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I've got one waiting to<br>
    transport aboard...</p>
  <p>9 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... complete with orders. Ensign<br>
    Ro Laren.</p>
  <p> Riker says it with an edge. He knows who she is. And<br>
    Picard also recognizes the name... reacts...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ro Laren? From the Wellington?</p>
  <p> He sees the Admiral signalling his attention...</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    The same one, sir. Should I tell<br>
    her a mistake's been made?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: the Admiral)<br>
    Stand by, Commander.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to the Admiral...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    I wrote the orders.<br>
    (off Picard's reaction)<br>
    I thought she'd be valuable to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... respectfully...<br>
    (beat, trying to fashion<br>
    a polite way of saying<br>
    this)<br>
    I would appreciate some consulting<br>
    rights on the assignment of a new<br>
    officer... especially someone with<br>
    the record of Ro Laren...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    She's Bajoran.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - 7/18/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are other Bajorans in<br>
    Starfleet... assign one of them...</p>
  <p> With increasing tension...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    I've discussed this situation with<br>
    her. I'm convinced she's the<br>
    right one for the job...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    After what happened at Garon Two,<br>
    she has no business serving on<br>
    any starship as far as I'm<br>
    concerned... let alone the<br>
    flagship, my ship...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    You're taking her... it's all<br>
    arranged... you have no idea how<br>
    difficult it was to get her out<br>
    of prison.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the Admiral.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's that important to you...</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    It's that important. To the<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed with the transport.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll fill you in later, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/25/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yessir.</p>
  <p> The Admiral smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I hope neither of us<br>
    regrets this.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    You can handle her, Captain. If<br>
    anyone can.</p>
  <p> Kennelly rises.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    I'll be on my way, then. Actually,<br>
    you know, I think I'm feeling<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (even)<br>
    Aunt Rebecca would be pleased.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Starting on a grim-faced Riker, clearly upset at<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> And as Collins works the controls, move to the<br>
    transporter pad as ENSIGN RO LAREN MATERIALIZES. She<br>
    is an attractive humanoid woman in her late twenties.<br>
    Her eyes gain our first attention, perhaps because her<br>
    brows are not separate but connect in a full line over<br>
    both eyes... the effect is rather sensual and darkly<br>
    intense.</p>
  <p> She carries a 24th-century backpack over one shoulder<br>
    and is dressed in Starfleet red; on one ear she wears<br>
    a silver ring. As she walks off the transporter, she<br>
    hands Riker a disc with her orders. She arrives with<br>
    all the enthusiasm of a plumber arriving to fix your<br>
    toilet just before quitting time.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Ensign Ro Laren reporting as<br>
    ordered, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/25/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker never breaks eye contact to look at her disc.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'll follow the Starfleet<br>
    uniform code aboard this ship,<br>
    Ensign.</p>
  <p> It takes her just a second to realize that he's talking<br>
    about her earring. And she glances at Collins with<br>
    the incredible smile of a woman who can't believe that<br>
    wherever she goes there is one more asshole waiting to<br>

    Ensign Laren, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They'll have to learn to live<br>

    I intend to demand the highest<br>

  <p> RO<br>
    The Bajoran custom has the family<br>

    I'm sorry, I didn't...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    No reason you should know. It<br>

    these days accept the distortion<br>
    of their names in order to<br>
    assimilate. I do not.</p>
  <p> A beat. Already Ro has them on the defensive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wish to be candid with you,<br>
    Ensign.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am fully aware of your Starfleet<br>
    record, your problems on other<br>
    ships, the incident on Garon Two<br>
    that led to your court martial.<br>
    I feel it only fair to inform you<br>
    that I am personally concerned<br>
    about your presence on this most<br>
    critical mission...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I don't want to be here any more<br>
    than you want me to be here. Sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then why did you accept this<br>
    assignment?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If I may be equally candid...<br>
    it's better than prison.</p>

  <p> RO<br>

    Let's get this over with as<br>

  <p>14 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, TROI, Worf, BEVERLY, Ro. Data<br>
    gives a mission update.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are dozens of Bajoran<br>
    camps on the three M-class<br>
    planets. I suggest we may want<br>
    to begin on Valo Three, where an<br>
    ad hoc leader named Jas Holza<br>
    lives. The Federation has had<br>
    several dealings with him...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I met Holza at a symposium a few<br>
    years ago...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What can you tell us about him,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (thinking back)<br>
    I found him to be a very concerned<br>
    leader and a good spokesman for<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    At least this man has genuine<br>
    experience in diplomacy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    That is not a small advantage on<br>
    this mission... Very well...<br>
    Mister Data, contact Holza,<br>
    arrange a meeting... set a course<br>
    for Valo Three.</p>

  <p> Ro looks down, unhappy...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there some problem, Ensign?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You're wasting your time.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to her.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Holza is nobody. He's the token<br>
    Bajoran that &quot;respectable&quot;<br>
    people...<br>
    (unsaid: like you)<br>
    ... invite to symposiums and<br>
    diplomatic soirees. But he has<br>
    no real influence among my people.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Whom do you suggest we talk to,<br>
    Ensign?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Don't you understand? These are<br>
    desperate people. Ready to martyr<br>
    themselves. They don't want to<br>
    talk...</p>

    It will be. Don't fool yourself.<br>
    This mission will end in<br>
    bloodshed.</p>
  <p> A silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (controlled)<br>
    Well. Let us hope you are<br>
    mistaken, Ensign. Now... perhaps<br>
    you could point us in the right<br>
    direction as Mister Data<br>
    suggested.</p>
  <p> And there is something we can notice in Ro... a mixed<br>
    feeling about what she's doing... chalk it up to<br>
    tracking down her own people if you like for now...<br>
    but there is a certain inevitability, a certain regret<br>
    in her tone here... perhaps she knows more than she<br>
    is telling...</p>

  <p>16 ANGLE</p>
  <p> to reveal the camp... and it is a devastating sight. A<br>
    collection of several dozen ramshackle huts line the<br>
    barren ground... built from bits and pieces of junk<br>
    and wire and colored tarps... small chicken-like<br>
    animals roam freely... clothes hang on lines that<br>

    read about the achievements of<br>
    the ancient Bajoran civilization<br>

    were architects and artists and<br>
    builders and philosophers... when<br>
    humans were not yet standing<br>
    erect.</p>
  <p> Picard takes in the scene before him.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Now I see how history has<br>
    rewarded them...</p>
  <p>17 ANGLE</p>
  <p> The children see them. Dirty, ill-clothed... they run<br>
    to the exciting visitors... surround them with<br>
    curiosity and hunger, touch their clothes, make an<br>
    uproarious noise... Picard glances over and studies --</p>
  <p>18 RO</p>
  <p> as she looks at these young ones with warmth and pain<br>
    and identification, and one three-year-old child who is<br>
    stark naked looks at her... and she takes off her<br>
    Starfleet jacket, kneels down and wraps it around the<br>
    child. She catches the eye of Picard watching her and<br>
    there is a vulnerability in her we haven't seen before<br>
    as she simply explains...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    This used to be me.</p>

  <p>19 ANGLE</p>
  <p> to reveal KEEVE FALOR chasing off all the children...<br>
    he is a man in his forties, proud, honest, plain-<br>
    speaking. Like all the Bajorans, he is dressed simply,<br>
    and wears several silver earrings on both ears.</p>

    You honor me by the proper use<br>
    of my name, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Ro has educated me.</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    Has she. Good.<br>
    (even, to Ro)<br>
    I'm pleased you still remember.</p>
  <p> And she can hear a prick of criticism... suggesting<br>
    that she is not truly one of them at all anymore.</p>

    and Worf walk behind.</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    We are not a violent race,<br>
    Captain. Just passionate about<br>
    our cause. And that passion has<br>
    led some to take up arms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you know where we can find<br>
    Orta?</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>

  <p> KEEVE<br>
    I'm sorry. I don't wish to help<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    Don't misunderstand. I for one<br>
    believe the raid on the Federation<br>
    outpost was poor judgment. You<br>
    are innocent bystanders, and I<br>
    cannot condone violence against<br>
    those who are not our enemies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I don't understand why you<br>
    are unwilling...</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    Because you are innocent<br>
    bystanders.</p>
  <p> They pause to watch as people wash clothes in water<br>
    falling from an open pipe...</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    You were innocent bystanders for<br>
    decades as the Cardassians took<br>
    our homes... as they violated and<br>
    tortured our people in the most<br>
    hideous ways imaginable... as we<br>
    were forced to flee...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We were saddened by those<br>
    events... but they occurred within<br>
    the designated borders of the<br>
    Cardassian Empire...</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    ... and the Federation is pledged<br>
    not to interfere in the internal<br>
    affairs of others.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not here to debate Federation<br>
    policy. I am prepared to offer<br>
    assistance...</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    Simply because of one terrorist<br>
    attack? Then perhaps I have been<br>
    wrong. We should have attacked<br>
    the Federation long ago. What<br>
    do you think of that, Ro?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I think you are a small man who<br>
    feels a rush of power in his belly<br>
    and enjoys it far too much,<br>
    Keeve. Stop talking and listen.</p>
  <p> He eyes her coldly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have had our own problems with<br>
    the Cardassians... now that there<br>
    is a treaty, we are in a position<br>
    to help. Your people have been<br>
    forced to resettle all over the<br>
    quadrant. We can make a<br>
    legitimate case with the<br>
    Cardassians that this is no longer<br>
    an isolated problem. We will work<br>
    diplomatically on your behalf...<br>
    but first the terrorist attacks<br>
    must end.</p>
  <p> A beat as Keeve considers, then, as an answer...</p>
  <p> KEEVE<br>
    We live in different universes,<br>
    you and I. Yours is about<br>
    diplomacy, politics, strategy.<br>
    Mine is about blankets. If we<br>

    alone... he studies her and nods and has to tell her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were helpful.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The blankets were helpful...<br>
    nothing I said mattered.</p>
  <p> And although it is said in a self-effacing way, it is<br>
    a way to blow off the compliment, to avoid bonding...<br>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    &quot;Truth&quot;, &quot;beauty&quot;... works for<br>
    a lot of things.</p>
  <p> Ro actually lets a genuine smile slip through, retreats<br>
    quickly into her drink.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    They say you never told anyone<br>
    the truth about Galon Two. You<br>
    didn't even defend yourself at<br>
    the court martial.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    What was to defend? I didn't<br>
    follow orders. Eight members of<br>

    he speaks through a voice box that is implanted in the<br>
    side of his neck... it is an eerily metallic sounding<br>
    voice...</p>
  <p> ORTA<br>
    Captain Picard... I am Orta.<br>
    Please excuse my appearance.<br>
    Unfortunately, as a guest of the<br>
    Cardassians some years ago, my<br>
    face... was mutilated... my vocal<br>
    cords cut.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Abducting us was not necessary.</p>
  <p> ORTA<br>
    I'm sorry. But after speaking<br>
    with Ro Laren, I decided that it<br>
    was.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then she has done us both a<br>
    disservice. For I am committed<br>
    to peace.</p>
  <p> ORTA<br>
    I am not at all interested in<br>
    peace. And I am not convinced<br>
    you are, either.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, whatever your motives,<br>
    you have already done enough<br>
    damage to these negotiations.<br>
    With your permission, Orta, I will<br>
    have her transported back to my<br>

  <p> Picard turns to face her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you could share them<br>
    with me.</p>
  <p> She wilts from his stare... finds herself in personal<br>

    much she cannot tell him. Orta answers before she has<br>
    a chance to.</p>
  <p> ORTA<br>
    Ro Laren is attempting to protect<br>
    the interests of two worlds,<br>
    Captain. She finds herself<br>
    uncomfortably caught between them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you wish her to remain, I will<br>
    agree, but she is not helping<br>
    matters by fostering distrust<br>

    All is not what it seems to be,<br>

    are a victim of this deception<br>
    as well, I do not know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deception?</p>

    Solarion Four...</p>

    That Starfleet couldn't offer.<br>
    Orta was to end the terrorism<br>
    against the Federation. Return<br>
    with his people to the camps.<br>
    In return he would get...<br>
    (a serious admission)<br>
    Weapons. Ships. Things that<br>
    could really make a difference<br>
    against the Cardassians in the<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> A silence. Picard tries to digest this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I find that... almost impossible<br>
    to believe. To suggest that<br>
    Admiral Kennelly would consider<br>
    sending weapons to terrorists...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If you ask him, he will deny it.<br>
    But it's true. I didn't leave<br>

    questions... and during the next<br>
    two hours as I was forced to<br>
    watch, my father was tortured<br>
    until he died. I remember feeling<br>
    so... ashamed... as my father<br>
    begged for mercy... I was ashamed<br>
    of him for being so weak. I was<br>
    ashamed of being Bajoran. Later<br>
    I began to understand how<br>
    misguided those feelings were.<br>
    And yet somehow they have remained<br>
    a part of me. I do not want to<br>
    be ashamed of my heritage any<br>
    longer.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I serve the Federation. But I<br>
    am Bajoran. A Starfleet admiral<br>
    presented me with an opportunity<br>
    to help my people in their fight<br>
    against the Cardassians. I had<br>
    to accept it.</p>
  <p> Picard studies her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you made this offer to Orta?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    No. After he told me the Bajorans<br>
    had not attacked Solarion Four...<br>
    nothing made sense anymore. I<br>
    decided to wait until I could<br>
    figure out what was going on...</p>
  <p> Picard rises...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That was a wise choice, Ensign.<br>
    It probably saved you from another<br>
    court martial.</p>

    who to trust anymore...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why did you come to me?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    That strange bartender of yours...<br>
    She has a way of getting to you,<br>
    you know?<br>
    (Picard nods)<br>
    She said you were her friend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It seems we find ourselves with...<br>
    something in common.<br>
    (a thoughtful beat)<br>
    Do you think Orta would cooperate<br>
    with us to determine the truth<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I think I can persuade him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our orders were to find him, bring<br>
    him back to the camps... any way<br>
    we could... perhaps that is<br>
    exactly what we should do.</p>

    And then what?</p>

    Well, rest assured, there will<br>

  <p> DOLAK<br>
    We intend to destroy it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Well, that puts me in a<br>
    difficult position. I've promised<br>
    to escort these people to their<br>
    camps.</p>
  <p> DOLAK<br>
    You are protecting the enemies<br>

    great offense...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    You have to protect the Cardassian<br>

    Well, I just see a different big<br>

    I see the Cardassian liaison, with<br>
    his Cardassian virus, coming to<br>
    meet with you after the attack<br>
    on Solarion Four. Now, we have<br>
    a mutual enemy, he says. The<br>
    Bajoran terrorists. The<br>
    Cardassians can't find them. But<br>
    maybe the Federation can. I am<br>
    beginning to see that our mission<br>
    has been, in fact, to expose<br>
    Orta... so the Cardassians could<br>
    move in and destroy him.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>

    I think you've lost your<br>

    Yes.</p>
  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    And you believed him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, Orta's ships are old and<br>
    obsolete. They do not have warp<br>
    capabilities. They could not have<br>
    reached another star system...<br>
    let alone attack one.</p>
  <p> That revelation hits Kennelly pretty hard... he blinks<br>

  <p> KENNELLY<br>
    But then who was responsible?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would suggest you ask your<br>
    friend the Cardassian liaison,<br>
    Admiral. The only explanation<br>
    I can think of is that the<br>
    Cardassians staged it.</p>

  <p> RO<br>
    If he's sent to the stockade on<br>

    will approve it. But I'd like<br>
    you to consider remaining in<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    You're not serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be a shame for Starfleet<br>
    to lose someone with your<br>
    potential.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (heartfelt)<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (reality beat)<br>
    But this uniform... it just<br>
    doesn't fit, Captain... and you<br>
    know it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That can change.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I don't think so.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've observed a certain quality<br>
    about you that... might be<br>
    harnessed, molded...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    ... don't count on it...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; - REV. 7/19/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Exasperated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's still a lot you can learn<br>
    from Starfleet, Ensign.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I've always thought Starfleet<br>
    could learn a lot from me,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That is an attitude I have found<br>
    to be common among the best<br>
    officers I've served with.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You are not one of those officers,<br>
    Ensign, but you might be<br>
    someday... if you decide to work<br>
    at it.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    An interesting challenge, sir.<br>
    And I rarely refuse an interesting<br>
    challenge.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    There would be one condition.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Condition... ?</p>
  <p> She attaches her silver earing to her ear. Picard<br>
    studies her and nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Enterprise. Two to beam<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> And as they DEMATERIALIZE...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
