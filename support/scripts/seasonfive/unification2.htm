    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ROMULAN CAVES</p>
  <p> Spock and Picard face each other as before. Data,<br>
    Pardek, Romulan #1, and the other abductor witness the<br>
    confrontation... Spock is not pleased to see anyone<br>
    from Starfleet. With building conflict --</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    What are you doing on Romulus?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That was to be my question for<br>
    you, sir.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    It is no concern of Starfleet's.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the contrary, Starfleet is most<br>
    concerned. You are in a position<br>
    to compromise the security of the<br>
    Federation...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    You may assure your superiors that<br>
    I am on a personal mission, of<br>
    peace, and will advise them when<br>
    appropriate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That will not be satisfactory.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    You cannot remain, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I cannot return without a full<br>
    explanation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ambassador, with the greatest<br>
    respect for all you've achieved<br>
    on behalf of the Federation, this<br>
    sort of cowboy diplomacy is not<br>
    easily tolerated any more...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 8/30/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    &quot;Cowboy diplomacy&quot;... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you wish to undertake a mission<br>
    with potential repercussions to<br>
    the Federation, it is appropriate<br>
    to discuss it with the Federation.<br>
    I am here as their representative.<br>
    You will have to discuss it with<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Spock frowns with frustration, moves away from<br>
    Picard... A thoughtful beat.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    This is precisely what I wanted<br>
    to avoid.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard moves away from the confrontation...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I also have the responsibility<br>
    of bearing some unhappy news.</p>
  <p> Spock turns back...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Sarek is dead.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges... after a very long beat... in<br>
    a softer voice...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Walk with me, Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a brief glance with Data telling him<br>
    to stay behind... follows Spock out of the chamber...</p>
  <p>2 INT. OTHER CAVERN</p>
  <p> Picard and Spock walk silently for a beat...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    I know of your mind meld with my<br>
    father... that enabled him to<br>
    complete his last mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was an honor. He was a great<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 8/30/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    He was a great representative of<br>
    the Vulcan people and of the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> And that is meant as a qualifier, not a compliment...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was with him before coming here.<br>
    He expressed his pride in you,<br>
    his love...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Emotional disarray is a symptom<br>
    of the illness from which he<br>
    suffered.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, the feelings were in his<br>
    heart, Spock. He shared them<br>
    with me. I know.</p>
  <p> Spock looks at Picard a moment... uncomfortable with<br>
    the emotional context of this, he moves into business.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Sarek would no more approve of<br>
    my coming to Romulus than you do,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> He takes a dramatic beat to organize his thoughts...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    For some time, I have been aware<br>
    of a growing movement here...<br>
    of people who seek to learn the<br>
    ideals of the Vulcan philosophy.<br>
    They have been declared enemies<br>
    of the state. But there are a<br>
    few in the Romulan hierarchy like<br>
    Pardek who are sympathetic. He<br>
    asked me to come now because he<br>
    believes it may be time to take<br>
    the first step toward<br>
    reunification.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to this extraordinary revelation...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/9/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reunification... After so many<br>
    centuries... so many fundamental<br>
    differences that have evolved<br>
    between your peoples...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (agrees)<br>
    It would seem unlikely to succeed.<br>
    But I cannot ignore the potential<br>
    rewards that a union between our<br>
    worlds would bring.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is this &quot;first step&quot; that<br>
    Pardek suggests... ?</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    There is a new Proconsul of the<br>
    Romulan Senate. He is young and<br>
    idealistic. He has promised many<br>
    reforms. Pardek believes he may<br>
    be receptive to discussing<br>
    reunification.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment to digest it all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why would you not bring something<br>
    this important to the attention<br>
    of your own people or the<br>
    Federation?</p>
  <p> Spock takes a beat to consider his response, it raises<br>
    unhappy memories.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    A personal decision, Captain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps you are aware that I<br>
    played a small role in the first<br>
    overture to peace with the<br>
    Klingons...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    History is aware of the role you<br>
    played, Ambassador.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Not entirely. It was I who asked<br>
    Kirk to lead that peace mission.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/9/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SPOCK (cont'd)<br>
    And I who had to accept the<br>
    responsibility for the<br>
    consequences to him and his crew.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Quite simply, I am unwilling to<br>
    risk anyone's life but my own on<br>
    this occasion. I would ask you<br>
    to respect my wishes and leave.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador, your logic escapes<br>
    me. If I didn't know better, I<br>
    would say your judgment had been<br>
    influenced by emotion.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    You speak as my father would if<br>
    he were here, Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I speak as a Starfleet officer<br>
    and I cannot ignore the risks to<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    I was involved with... &quot;cowboy<br>
    diplomacy&quot;, as you describe it,<br>
    Captain, long before you were<br>
    born.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, sir, I am not<br>
    prepared to leave until your<br>
    affairs are completed.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In your own way, you are as<br>
    stubborn as another Captain of<br>
    the Enterprise I once knew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, sir, I am in good company.</p>
  <p> As Spock reluctantly acknowledges and accepts Picard's<br>
    continued presence with a nod...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>3 INT. KLINGON BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data, still in disguise, has just returned from the<br>
    surface... Captain K'VADA reacts to the news with<br>
    irritation... the Conn and Tactical Officers observe.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    We have more important things to<br>
    attend to than acting as your<br>
    nursemaids.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain Picard regrets that he<br>
    must detain you but it is<br>
    necessary for a while longer.<br>
    In addition, I will be requiring<br>
    access to your ship's computer...</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    (reacts, suspicious)<br>
    Access to our computer... for what<br>
    purpose?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am going to attempt to penetrate<br>
    the Romulan Central Information<br>
    Net...</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    Don't bother. We've been trying<br>
    for years.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have unique skills that may<br>
    permit me to succeed.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    I cannot reveal classified Klingon<br>
    entry codes to Starfleet...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your entry codes can be easily<br>
    reconfigured after we depart.<br>
    And Captain Picard has authorized<br>
    me to share with you any<br>
    information we obtain from the<br>
    Romulan data banks...</p>
  <p> The Klingon frowns, grunts -- &quot;Fine... &quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    Anything else?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We will also need to communicate<br>
    with the Enterprise in sector<br>
    two-thirteen.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    You do and the Romulans will<br>
    instantly know our coordinates.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Using conventional means, that<br>
    would be true; however I propose<br>
    that we piggy-back our signal on<br>
    Romulan subspace transmissions...</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    &quot;Piggy-back&quot;?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A Human metaphor, pardon me. We<br>
    would use a Romulan signal as a<br>
    carrier for own own, thus<br>
    disguising its origin.</p>
  <p> K'VADA<br>
    It won't work.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it will. During the<br>
    last hour, I have conducted a<br>
    systematic review of the entire<br>
    Romulan subspace grid and compared<br>
    my findings with the<br>
    specifications of your<br>
    transmission array. It would<br>
    appear they are compatible.</p>
  <p> The Klingon studies him for a long, dry beat, finally<br>
    grunts an approval.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS... a beat as K'Vada muses and then hits a<br>
    panel...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/4/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>

    we study the potential for a<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/12/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> And we stay for a beat as that thought lingers on his<br>
    face and...</p>
  <p>4 EXT. ROMULAN STREET</p>
  <p> A Romulan child of twelve (D'TAN) as he runs onto the<br>
    street out of breath, carrying a single flower...<br>
    pauses looks around...</p>
  <p>4A ANGLE - THE STREET</p>
  <p> ... colorless, bleak... pedestrians only... this is a<br>
    poor neighborhood, life here is a struggle... a line of<br>
    people wait to get into a general store... a small cafe<br>
    has a few customers...</p>
  <p>4B D'TAN</p>
  <p> sees the one he's looking for... moves to the line,<br>
    hands the flower to a man (ROMULAN#1); the man reacts,<br>
    glances around, gets out of line... follow him to...</p>
  <p>4C THE CAFE</p>
  <p> Dark, austere, a row of silent people stand at counters<br>
    eating silently... finding, in the shadows, Spock and<br>
    Picard, standing alone, dressed as Romulans... he moves<br>
    to them, puts the flower in a glass of water and<br>
    places it in front of them on the table...</p>
  <p> ROMULAN#1<br>
    Allow me to brighten your table.<br>
    (makes eye contact with<br>
    Spock)<br>
    Jolan True.</p>
  <p> He moves on. Spock understands the signal. They<br>
    speak in hushed tones...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    The Senate has adjourned. Pardek<br>
    will be here shortly...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just how widespread is this<br>
    movement?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 9/12/91 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>4C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    There are groups in every<br>
    populated area. I have personally<br>
    spoken with members from four<br>
    provinces.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Unification&quot; Pt. II - REV. 8/30/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He stops as an OLD GRIM WOMAN delivers their soup...<br>
    she looks hard at the flower, at these strangers...<br>
    a silent moment... then she leaves...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    It has become a serious concern<br>
    to the Romulan leadership.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Serious enough for the leaders<br>
    to suddenly embrace a Vulcan<br>
    peace initiative? I have a<br>
    difficult time accepting that.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    I sense you have a closed mind,<br>
    Captain. Closed minds have kept<br>
    these two worlds apart for<br>
    centuries.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts with curiosity to this conflict...<br>
    because Spock has really brought something of his<br>
    own to the table...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In the Federation, we have learned<br>
    from experience to view the<br>
    Romulans with distrust. We can<br>
    either choose to live with that<br>
    enmity or seek an opportunity to<br>
    change it. I choose the latter...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will be the first to cheer when<br>
    the Neutral Zone is abolished,<br>
    sir. I only wonder if this<br>
    movement is strong enough to<br>
    reshape the entire Romulan<br>
    political landscape.</p>
  <p> Spock takes a beat... nodding to the flower on the<br>
    table...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    One can begin to reshape the<br>
    landscape with a single flower,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> But he's not at peace as he says it, experiencing<br>
    additional conflicts within himself...</p>

    what I've brought you...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    This is my friend, D'Tan... he<br>
    is very curious about Vulcan...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello, D'Tan...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (re: book)<br>
    It is very old. Where did you<br>
    get this?</p>
  <p> D'TAN<br>
    They read from it at the<br>
    meetings... it tells the story<br>
    of the Vulcan separation...</p>
  <p> PARDEK (o.c.)<br>
    You should not bring that out<br>
    here, D'Tan. You've been told<br>
    many times...</p>
  <p>4E ANGLE</p>
  <p> to include Pardek...</p>
  <p> D'TAN<br>
    I just wanted to show it to Mister<br>
    Spock...</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    Off with you... we will see you<br>
    later tonight...</p>
  <p> D'TAN<br>
    (to Spock)<br>
    Will you tell us more stories<br>
    about Vulcan?</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Yes...</p>

    So, what do you think of your<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    These people are no one's enemy,<br>
    Senator.</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    (smiles, acknowledges)<br>
    Many of my colleagues fear what<br>
    they have to say. But I have<br>
    learned to listen carefully.<br>
    Children like D'Tan are our<br>
    future. Old men like me will not<br>
    be able to hold on to ancient<br>
    prejudice and hostility. These<br>
    young people won't allow it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now that they've met their first<br>
    real Vulcan, it has only inspired<br>
    them more. I'm sure that is<br>
    evident to you, Spock...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    I did not anticipate such a<br>
    passionate response to my arrival.</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    Romulans are a passionate people,<br>
    Spock. The Vulcans will learn<br>
    to appreciate that quality in us.</p>

  <p> Close on an alien woman (AMARIE) at a keyboard... she<br>
    must have been quite a looker once, but her best years<br>
    are clearly behind her now. There's a bored, routine<br>
    quality to her playing... aside from the fact that she<br>
    has four arms. In one hand, she holds, not a<br>
    cigarette, but a salt stick that she sucks on. She has<br>
    a tip jar that has a few gold coins in it...</p>

    The trail has led us to the former<br>
    wife of a deceased smuggler.</p>

    couple of alien hookers wait for trade to pick up...<br>
    some very strange faces stay mysteriously in the<br>
    shadows of tables in the back... Amarie looks up to see<br>
    Riker sitting down at the piano bar...</p>

    To be honest, I can't think of<br>
    a good reason.</p>
  <p> AMARIE<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Well, you did kill my ex-husband.<br>
    That's not a bad start. Why don't<br>
    you drop a few coins in the jar.<br>
    I'll see what I remember.</p>

  <p> A stateliness, suggesting great power. Very clean<br>

    Enter.</p>
  <p> Pardek comes in with Spock. Moving to find an<br>

    Please. I've never liked titles<br>

  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NERAL<br>
    It's been years since old Pardek<br>
    was invited to an official<br>
    function. He's far too attached<br>
    to the &quot;common man&quot; for most<br>
    peoples' comfort.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    That is their loss. I've always<br>
    found Pardek to have a unique<br>
    insight into many issues.</p>
  <p> They sit.</p>
  <p> NERAL<br>
    Let me tell you something, Spock.<br>
    We're going to start something<br>
    here, you and I, that will redraw<br>
    the face of the quadrant.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    You are prepared to support<br>
    reunification?</p>
  <p> NERAL<br>
    I believe it must eventually come.<br>
    Our two worlds need each other.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Forgive me. But I did not expect<br>
    to hear a Romulan Proconsul speak<br>
    like a member of your<br>

  <p> NERAL<br>
    I want you to know exactly where<br>
    I stand.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>

    Do you believe you can gain the<br>
    support of the full Senate?</p>

    (he rises)<br>
    Spock, I am prepared to publicly<br>
    endorse the opening of talks<br>
    between our peoples... How do<br>
    you think the Vulcan people will<br>
    respond to that?</p>
  <p> A public announcement. This is astounding.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    They will be... cautious. There<br>

  <p> SPOCK<br>

    It is more than we could have<br>

  <p> That stops the excitement. Picard looks at Spock,<br>

  <p> PARDEK<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't imagine that one rises<br>
    to the position of Senate<br>
    Proconsul without the support of<br>
    the Romulan traditionalists.</p>
  <p> PARDEK<br>
    That's true.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, how can he turn his back<br>
    on them so easily? How can he<br>
    endorse reunification when it is<br>
    considered subversive?</p>
  <p> ROMULAN#1<br>
    Because he's not afraid of<br>
    them... because he knows we will<br>
    support him...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Captain Picard is correct. It<br>
    is not logical for the Proconsul<br>
    to endorse reunification at this<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Clamor... disappointment... objections...</p>

  <p> ROMULAN#2<br>
    No, this is our chance for<br>

    You are as skeptical as I am...<br>

  <p> SPOCK<br>
    I fear the influence of Sarek has<br>
    colored your attitudes, Captain.<br>
    Toward reunification. And perhaps<br>
    toward me.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is the second time you have<br>

    Yes, he will always be a part of<br>
    me. His experiences. His spirit.<br>

    Spock. Not his.</p>
  <p> Spock studies him...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Curious.<br>

    That I should hear him so clearly<br>
    now that he is dead.</p>
  <p> Spock moves away from Picard, thoughtfully...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    It is possible that I have brought<br>
    my arguments with Sarek to you,<br>
    Captain. If so, I apologize.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it so important for you to win<br>
    one last argument with him?</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>

    possibility)<br>
    No, it is not.<br>

  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (compassionate)<br>
    Your fight with Sarek is over.<br>
    And you have none with me.</p>
  <p> Spock looks deep inside to find a way to explain<br>
    this... and in a way he looks at Picard in this<br>
    situation as a surrogate for his father, trying one<br>
    last time to find a context for their relationship.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    I always had a different vision<br>
    than my father... an ability to<br>
    see beyond pure logic. He<br>
    considered it... weak. But I<br>
    have discovered it to be a source<br>
    of extraordinary strength.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sarek would find this mission<br>
    of reunification a fool's<br>
    errand... But somehow I think<br>
    it is not. Logic cannot explain<br>
    why... but I know I must continue<br>
    to pursue this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Even if it leads you into a<br>
    Romulan trap...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    If the Romulans do have an<br>
    ulterior motive, it would be in<br>
    the interests of all concerned<br>
    to determine what it is.</p>
  <p> Picard cannot deny it.</p>

    He intrigues me, this Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In what manner?</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    He is remarkably analytical and<br>
    dispassionate for a Human. I<br>
    understand why my father would<br>
    choose to mind meld with him.<br>
    There's almost a Vulcan quality<br>
    to the man.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interesting. I have never<br>
    considered that. And Captain<br>
    Picard has been a role model in<br>
    my quest to be more Human.</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    To be more Human?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Ambassador.</p>
  <p> Spock raises an eyebrow...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Fascinating.<br>
    (off Data's reaction)<br>
    You have an efficient intellect,<br>
    superior physical skills and no<br>
    emotional impediments. There are<br>
    Vulcans who aspire all their<br>
    lives to achieve what you were<br>
    given by design.</p>
  <p> Data considers this a moment and then...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are half Human...</p>
  <p> SPOCK<br>
    Yes.</p>
