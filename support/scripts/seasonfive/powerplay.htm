  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Approaches a MOON, which is cloaked with angry storm<br>
    CLOUDS and LIGHTNING arcs of tremendous electrical<br>
    activity. All silhouetted against a nearby massive,<br>
    glowing gas-giant PLANET, the mother of this dark<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45571.2.<br>
    We are going into orbit around<br>
    an unexplored M-class moon of<br>
    Mab-Bu Six. Though the moon was<br>
    reported to be uninhabited, we<br>
    have picked up a weak distress<br>
    call.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are at Data's station... listening<br>
    to an audio distress signal... puzzled... WORF is at<br>
    tactical. ENSIGN RO is at the conn, and TROI ENTERS<br>
    from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The intense electromagnetic<br>
    whirlwinds on the moon's surface<br>
    make it virtually impossible to<br>
    locate the source of the signal,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any indications of life, Mister<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Scanners read negative, sir. But<br>
    they may be affected by the<br>
    interference.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have you ever heard anything like<br>
    that, Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - TEASER 2.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (curious)<br>
    I believe so, Commander... at<br>
    Starfleet Academy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Academy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir, let me verify it...</p>
  <p> Running panels...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As I thought, sir... it is a<br>
    Starfleet subspace distress<br>
    signal... standard to Daedalus<br>
    class starships...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts, to Picard)<br>
    There hasn't been a Daedalus class<br>
    in service for... what... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One hundred seventy-two years,<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any record of missing ships in<br>
    this vicinity, Data?</p>
  <p> Checking --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The U.S.S. Essex under the command<br>
    of Captain Bryce Shumar<br>
    disappeared in this sector over<br>
    two centuries ago...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (checking)<br>
    Yes, Captain... I have accessed<br>
    the subspace transponder signature<br>
    of the Essex... it is identical<br>
    to the signal coming from the moon's<br>
    surface...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've arrived a little late...</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> As she experiences curious empathic feelings...</p>
  <p> PICARD (o.c.)<br>
    Mute it, Data.</p>
  <p> Data turns off the sound.</p>
  <p>3A RESUME</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    With the storm activity down<br>
    there, I don't think it's worth<br>
    the risk to check on a ghost ship,<br>
    Number One... advise Starfleet<br>
    we've solved the mystery of<br>
    Captain Shumar and the Essex...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure we have...</p>
  <p> They turn to look at her...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Someone's down there... alive...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 EXT. MOON - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in the atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First officer's log, supplemental.<br>
    The electromagnetic interference<br>
    on the surface was judged too<br>
    dangerous for anyone to transport<br>
    down. So we have taken a<br>
    shuttle to investigate.</p>
  <p>5 INT. SHUTTLE - IN FLIGHT</p>
  <p> On RIKER, TROI and DATA, being buffeted inside on an<br>
    instruments-only run, a rough-as-they-come flight.<br>
    Over this, the distress SIGNAL mournfully plays,<br>
    stronger.</p>
  <p> A burst of nearby LIGHTNING brightens their faces.<br>
    The THUNDER following this sounds like the voice of<br>
    doom.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Shields are holding...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (checking instruments)<br>
    Wind shear is incredible, Data...<br>
    keep an eye on the stabilizers...<br>
    (glances at Troi)<br>
    If it's anything like this on the<br>
    ground, I don't see how anyone<br>
    could survive on this moon for<br>
    long.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe they've been living<br>
    underground.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Question is where? I still can't<br>
    locate the source of the damn<br>
    signal... it's bouncing around<br>
    more than we are...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/04/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They suddenly take a severe hit... Red warning LIGHTS<br>
    flash, a KLAXON sounds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, forward thrusters have<br>
    failed. We are losing power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enterprise... ?</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard at command.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> No response for a beat, then in scratchy reception:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COMM VOICE<br>
    We've lost our thrusters...<br>
    attempting to compensate with<br>
    secondary boosters...</p>
  <p> With a burst of CRACKLE, Riker's voice disappears.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir? The shuttle's impulse<br>
    generators have shut down...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander? Can you hear me?</p>
  <p>7 INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Riker and Co. struggle to keep their small, shaking<br>
    craft aloft.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (completely fritzed)<br>
    Enterprise to shuttle, please<br>
    respond.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold on! We're going down...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Initiating emergency landing<br>
    procedures...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maintain the approach attitude<br>
    Data... I'm taking her in...</p>
  <p> The craft hits the ground roughly... the crew tossed<br>
    violently from side to side... the LIGHTS FAIL and<br>
    we're consumed by darkness... and finally silence.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. MOON SURFACE - INSIDE FOG</p>
  <p> CAMERA PANS through the murk, until we see the SHUTTLE.<br>
    It's battered, sitting deadly still. More THUNDER<br>
    booms, as LIGHTNING cracks. But no sign of life shows<br>
    from inside the fallen craft.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> A flurry of activity. Our people are down there.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The shuttle has crashed on the<br>
    surface...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have their position?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I am picking up the shuttle's<br>
    trace signature... but the surface<br>
    interference is distorting its<br>
    position...</p>
  <p> Worf continues to struggle vainly with his console...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Can you locate them...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I think I can... I followed their<br>
    entry almost all the way in...<br>
    we can calculate the coordinates<br>
    from their angle of descent...</p>
  <p>10 EXT. MOON SURFACE</p>
  <p> On the shuttle. The hatch blows off and Riker emerges,<br>
    holding his arm. Data and Troi follow, shook-up but<br>
    intact. FOG swirls all around them, as distant<br>
    thunderbolts brighten the scene: a BARREN LANDSCAPE<br>
    with charred rocks and terrain, as if a forest fire has<br>
    swept through the area. Dark and windy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taps communicator)<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> But no answer from above. Troi looks around, Data runs<br>
    a tricorder scan. Riker's in pain but trying to ignore<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is unlikely, sir, that we will<br>
    be able to establish communication<br>
    with the ship, given the severe<br>
    electromagnetic interference...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/06/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (in pain)<br>
    Then we'll stay put right here<br>
    until the Enterprise finds us...<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Data, run an inventory of what's<br>
    still usable inside the shuttle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the shuttle door, looks back inside.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your arm...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's<br>
    broken...</p>
  <p> Riker checks the terrain with a tricorder...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The surface is composed of<br>
    nonporous rock... makes me<br>
    think it's even more unlikely<br>
    anyone could live here...</p>
  <p> Troi nods thoughtfully, as something else catches her<br>
    attention, behind Riker. Data returns from the<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are no instruments left of<br>
    practical value that have not been<br>
    damaged by the impact of our<br>
    landing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (points to horizon)<br>
    What is that?</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> to include distant GLIMMERING lights, seen ghostly<br>
    through the fog and clouds. Dancing in the mist.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/06/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doesn't look like any storm front<br>
    I've ever seen...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (checking with the<br>
    tricorder)<br>
    The tricorder is picking up high<br>
    levels of E-M bursts across the<br>
    spectrum.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you picking up anything else,<br>
    Data... like signs of life... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Other than our own, sir...<br>
    negative.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Troi...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There is someone alive here...<br>
    I'm more certain of it now than<br>
    ever...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I hope they can find us...<br>
    because we don't have a way to<br>
    find them...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    They're coming... they're coming<br>
    with the storm...</p>
  <p> A rumble of thunder in the distance... off Riker's<br>
    reaction...</p>
  <p>12 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> On O'Brien and Geordi at the controls...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can't get a pattern lock on<br>
    the communicators because of the<br>
    E-M bursts, Captain. There's<br>
    no way to beam them out of<br>
    there... not under these<br>
    conditions...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The same conditions won't permit<br>
    a shuttle to land safely, Mister<br>
    LaForge... any suggestions... ?</p>
  <p>14 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> O'Brien touches the console, muting the transmission.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Sir, let me beam down with a<br>
    pattern enhancer...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Chief, there's no guarantee you<br>
    won't rematerialize in a million<br>
    pieces if your signal gets caught<br>
    up in that electromagnetic<br>
    whirlwind...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I can boost the confinement<br>
    beam. One person might be able<br>
    to make it...</p>
  <p> During the following, O'Brien takes tech equipment out<br>
    of a storage closet or cabinet... Geordi HITS the<br>
    companel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat, to com)<br>
    Captain, Chief O'Brien wants to<br>
    beam down to the surface with a<br>
    pattern enhancer...</p>
  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    His chances of getting down there<br>
    safely are no better than fifty-<br>
    fifty in my judgement...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, a major storm front is<br>
    moving in on the away team's<br>
    coordinates...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister O'Brien... you are aware<br>
    of the risks?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yessir. I think I can make it.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD COM VOICE<br>
    Prepare to transport.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> And as he moves toward the transporter pad...</p>
  <p>17 EXT. MOON SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker rests, as Troi and Data survey the foggy area.<br>
    O'Brien MATERIALIZES between them and the shuttle.<br>
    Only to be greeted by more thunder and LIGHTNING.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Glad you could join us.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Great spot for a picnic, sir.</p>
  <p> He begins to unload the equipment pack... handing gear<br>
    to the others, they all know basically what to do...</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    We need to distribute the enhancer<br>
    rods at seven meter legs... that<br>
    ought to do it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Storm front going to affect the<br>
    transport, Chief... ?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'd really like to get us out of<br>
    here before it hits, Commander...<br>
    see, I'm supposed to be feeding<br>
    the baby lunch... Molly gets in<br>
    a terribly foul mood if I'm<br>
    late...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm with you...</p>
  <p> Equipment handed out, Riker struggling with one arm to<br>
    do his part...</p>
  <p>18 UP ANGLE</p>
  <p> They hurriedly position three upright ENHANCER RODS<br>
    around them to form a triangle. Thunder approaches.<br>
    Data and O'Brien spread out... Riker goes with Troi...</p>
  <p>19 ANGLE ON STORM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A spectacular system of LIGHTNING BOLTS explode, light<br>
    up the sky. Followed by rolling THUNDER, inside angry,<br>
    swirling CLOUDS. Within seconds, wind howling, thunder<br>
    crashing, the STORM overtakes our away team.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lunch time, O'Brien! Let's do<br>
    it!</p>
  <p> O'Brien attempts to activate his rod but a moment later<br>
    -- FLASH! A LIGHTNING BOLT strikes the rod -- and blows<br>
    O'Brien away from it.</p>

    HUMMING...</p>
  <p> Mysterious ENERGY RINGS OF LIGHT suddenly appear, dive<br>
    about like wavy alien fireflies. THREE RINGS eerily<br>
    PULSE down onto Data, Troi and O'Brien... ANOTHER tries<br>
    to approach Riker but is repelled somehow...</p>
  <p>24 RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Crawls up to O'Brien's enhancer rod, determined. And<br>
    reaches out for the enhancer rod, throws the final<br>
    switch. Three BEAMS OF BLUE LIGHT instantly turn on<br>
    and connect - making a horizontal TRIANGLE OF LIGHT<br>
    between the upright rods, which encloses them. <br>
    Riker collapses.</p>

    warning, Troi's EYES JERK OPEN and she BOLTS UPRIGHT,<br>
    knocking aside equipment -- crying out in terror, as <br>
    if awakened from a nightmare. Beverly's startled, and<br>
    grasps Troi by the arms to keep her from struggling.</p>

    Troi keeps looking around, as if to reorient herself.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're back on the Enterprise...<br>
    Everything's okay now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But my skin... It's tingling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are experiencing some<br>
    afterimages from the<br>
    electromagnetic discharge. The<br>
    sensation will pass. Try to<br>
    relax...</p>
  <p> Troi does relax a little, but sees Riker and O'Brien<br>
    lying on nearby tables, being tended by a NURSE. Data<br>
    stands nearby. Worried, Troi looks back to Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They're all fine, too. Now take<br>
    your time, Counselor, okay?<br>
    Doctor's orders.</p>
  <p> Troi nods, eases back onto the bed. Picard ENTERS and<br>
    Beverly moves to meet him, to have a private exchange.</p>

    Injury report, Doctor?</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mostly minor abrasions. But<br>
    Commander Riker took the worst<br>
    of it with a broken arm... The<br>
    biofilter scans showed their<br>
    nervous systems were generating<br>
    unusally high levels of synaptic<br>
    energy. I don't think it's<br>
    anything to worry about...</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, moves with Beverly over to the<br>
    team. O'Brien and Riker are back on their feet,<br>
    looking alert. Troi now sits on the edge of the table,<br>
    still a bit woozy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good work, Mister O'Brien.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ready for duty, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you sure, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods, flexes his<br>
    injured arm)<br>
    It's not the first bone I've<br>
    broken.</p>
  <p> As they prepare to exit, Picard turns his attention<br>
    to Troi, who weakly smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And how are you, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Very glad to be here.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, leads them out, as Riker moves<br>
    next to him. They EXIT...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Everyone reacts to his unusual stutter. Troi shares a<br>
    quick look with Data. Something we'll connect later.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there something wrong, Data?</p>
  <p> The turbolift stops and the doors open.</p>

    station. Troi and Data again share a look, unseen by<br>
    the others.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... may I speak with you<br>
    a moment? In private?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course, Counselor.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Take the bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> Riker nods as Picard and Troi head to the ready room.<br>
    Data relieves ND at ops and begins to study the<br>
    console. The ND EXITS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, deploy sensor scans<br>
    when you're ready. Ensign, move<br>
    into a synchronous orbit aligned<br>
    with our crash site.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Data reacts, turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir? Given the E-M field<br>
    properties of this moon, I would<br>
    recommend a search pattern<br>
    beginning at the southern<br>
    p-p-polar region.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    The polar region... But that's<br>
    starting from scratch, Data. The<br>
    last reading we had on the Essex<br>
    would suggest we begin the scans<br>
    near our crash site...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Essex signal was never clearly<br>
    located, sir.<br>

  <p> DATA (cont'd)<br>
    A broader, systematic survey of<br>
    the moon from a p-p-polar orbit<br>
    might be more practical.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considers a beat)<br>
    Well, you might be right. Still,<br>
    I'd like to give the crash site<br>
    a once-over first... We'll<br>
    maintain our present orbit for<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Understood, sir.</p>
  <p> Data turns to the console. OFF his face as he works...</p>
  <p>29 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard behind his desk, speaks to Troi, who is pacing<br>
    nervously in front of the desk, arguing her point.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've never felt anything quite<br>
    like it... It was almost as though<br>
    they were calling to me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Are you saying someone was<br>
    communicating telepathically,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps. For an instant. It was<br>
    like their voices were carried<br>
    on the wind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What were they trying to<br>
    communicate?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure... but they were<br>
    calling me to the southern polar<br>
    region... I believe that's where<br>
    we should look for the Essex...</p>

  <p>30 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Ensign Ro reacts to her console, confused.</p>
  <p> ENSIGN RO<br>
    Commander? Did you override my<br>
    orbital heading?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Override them?</p>
  <p> ENSIGN RO<br>
    We've moved into a polar orbit.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, looks at Data...</p>
  <p> ENSIGN RO<br>
    I'm locked out, the helm isn't<br>
    responding...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, do you know anything<br>
    about this?</p>
  <p> Data doesn't respond, but continues to calmly work his<br>
    console, his back to Riker. Riker moves toward Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data... ?</p>
  <p> Riker reaches out, touches Data's shoulder. Suddenly,<br>
    Data spins and looks at Riker, Data's face contorted<br>
    with intense anger. Riker reacts, stunned. Data,<br>
    lightning-fast, thrusts his arms forward, STRIKING<br>
    Riker hard in the chest, knocking Riker back on the<br>
    floor. All follows very quickly, as Riker responds:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Security to the bridge!</p>
  <p> Worf quickly reacts, drawing his phaser -- but O'Brien<br>
    catches him offguard from behind, GRABS Worf's wrist<br>
    and wrenches the phaser free. He SLAMS Worf to the<br>
    floor, hard, stunning him.</p>

    Computer, transfer command to<br>
    engineering... Full security<br>

  <p> O'Brien fires again, stunning Riker, as audio alarms<br>
    go off. Suddenly all bridge consoles DEACTIVATE, as<br>
    Data futilely works his console, bangs it in<br>
    frustration.</p>

    Picard in the chest and knocks him down. Troi races<br>
    out.</p>
  <p>32 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Troi angrily ENTERS, looks around the bridge to Data.<br>
    Riker, Ro and Worf are splayed out on the floor, as<br>
    O'Brien robs the bridge locker for two more PHASERS.<br>
    All is played on the move to the turbolift...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    This way!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He would not move to a polar<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    (angry at Data)<br>
    You could not wait? The captain<br>
    would have done it for me...</p>
  <p> Riker, still recovering from his phaser stun, reacts<br>
    to this new member of the revolt, as O'Brien speeds<br>
    to the turbolift, calls out to them. Troi and Data<br>
    follow O'Brien into the turbolift.</p>

    other, all under an alien influence. Their movements<br>
    bristling with great tension. Not happy alien campers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They have t-t-trapped us... what<br>

  <p> Data RIPS off a wall panel, STICKS HIS FINGERS right<br>
    into the circuits -- short circuiting them, causing<br>
    SPARKS to sizzle all around him. The security fields<br>
    start to fritz, then they both DEACTIVATE... Data then<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Everyone down! Now!!</p>
  <p> O'Brien aims to fire his phaser, but Worf FIRES first,<br>
    hitting O'Brien. He stumbles back, a little stunned<br>
    but not stopped by the blast. As the crowd scrambles<br>
    for cover, a quick and harrowing phaser fight takes<br>
    place:</p>
  <p> O'Brien FIRES back, just missing Worf but BLASTING a<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    How about flooding their air vents<br>
    with anesthizine gas?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That won't affect Data. No<br>

    knock out all three of them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A concussive charge would blow<br>
    out the security field. Then we<br>
    could go in with phasers on wide<br>

    out later...</p>
  <p> Picard considers it... inherently fears the risk...<br>

    degrees, south.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Ro, who's working the console, signals<br>
    her to mute... (This will be required visual<br>
    communication any time the bridge crew interrupts their<br>
    exchange with Ten Forward for private dicussions.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> Picard nods to Ro again to mute...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've compared the away team's last<br>
    transport trace patterns to<br>
    earlier records. They're exactly<br>
    the same, except in Troi, Data and<br>
    O'Brien there's an unusual<br>
    synaptic activity -- some kind<br>
    of anionic energy. It may be a<br>
    life-form superimposing neural<br>
    patterns onto our people.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why wasn't I affected?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know. But one difference<br>
    between you and the others was<br>
    that you were injured.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My broken arm...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The fracture caused pain receptors<br>
    to fire which may have made you<br>
    immune... to this energy.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker consider this theory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If your theory is accurate, what<br>
    would happen if we inflicted pain<br>
    on the others...</p>

    That might force whatever it is<br>
    out of our people.</p>

    for control... timing would be<br>
    critical...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    How would you gain access?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could use a micro-optic drill<br>
    through the ceiling and they'd<br>
    never detect it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If this is going to work, we need<br>
    some way to contain that anionic<br>

  <p> Ro reacts. Geordi checks out the floor with his<br>
    tricorder, as Ro catches up to him. As Ro sets up a<br>
    device nearby to do the drilling, Geordi fixes on a<br>
    spot amid the relays and hard component arrays.</p>

    This anionic energy seems to<br>
    be vulnerable to the same magnetic<br>

    that, we can trap it once it's<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You ought to be able to do it<br>
    by pumping Ten Forward full of<br>

    Worf --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Impressions, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Spiritual possessions of this sort<br>
    have been reported throughout<br>

    &quot;Jat'yIn&quot; -- the taking of the<br>
    living by the dead.</p>

    Yes, Human history is also full<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    spirit of Captain Shumar...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (not really serious)<br>
    ... then he should be on much<br>
    better behavior, don't you<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    After living disembodied for two<br>
    centuries, perhaps they have gone<br>
    mad...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, I assure you these<br>

    little bracelet that Keiko wears on her wrist.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I gave you that...</p>
  <p> Keiko looks up, startled by the remark. The alien<br>

    Let me speak to him.</p>
  <p> She nods, &quot;go ahead,&quot; hits her combadge for him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/03/91 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, I think we have an<br>
    opportunity to end this seige...</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to the word &quot;opportunity&quot;...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it will require cooperation<br>
    from all concerned. Our guests<br>
    will be moving shortly to cargo<br>
    bay four, where the transport will<br>
    occur. You are to ensure their<br>
    safe passage from Ten Forward to<br>
    the cargo bay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood, Captain.<br>
    (signals to mute)<br>
    Mister La Forge, Doctor...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to the aft stations...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir...</p>

  <p> O'Brien at the computer...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Transporter controls are being<br>
    transferred...</p>
  <p> He stops as he sees something unusual on the monitor...<br>
    hits the companel...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Ten Forward to bridge. I said all<br>
    transporter controls. Including<br>
    those aboard all your<br>
    shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p>91 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Ro angrily pushes back from the tactical station with<br>
    frustration... her trick failed...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/03/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    Almost had them, Ensign... nice<br>
    try...<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Ten Forward. Our mistake.<br>
    Remaining transporter functions<br>
    are being transferred to you...</p>
  <p>92 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> O'Brien goes to work on the computer...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    By creating our own access code,<br>
    we will be able to prevent anyone<br>
    from using the transporter against<br>
    us as we move to the cargo bay...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What about their weapons?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We will each take a hostage for<br>
    protection... Captain Picard, you<br>
    are mine.</p>
  <p> Data points to Worf, O'Brien takes Keiko... the baby<br>
    cries as she feels the motions...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Please... let her stay...</p>
  <p> Fed up with the crying, O'Brien takes the baby and puts<br>
    it in the hands of a supernumerary...</p>

  <p> Data works the computer.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/03/91 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>94 INT. DECK TEN - CORRIDOR - NEAR TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Troi holds a phaser to Picard, as Data/Worf and<br>
    O'Brien/Keiko trail behind - all push by a security<br>
    team, who stand at the sides, helpless to aid their<br>
    captain and crewmates. The group ENTERS a turbolift.</p>
  <p>95 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister La Forge, Doctor --<br>
    they'll be at their destination<br>
    in less than a minute...</p>
  <p> ENSIGN RO<br>
    They've stopped at deck eighteen,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (into com)<br>
    Security, allow them access into<br>
    cargo bay four...</p>
  <p>96 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> As they enter. O'Brien goes immediately to the<br>
    console, leaving Keiko at the side, as Troi/Picard and<br>
    Data/Worf stand nearby. There's room aplenty inside<br>
    the bay. And at the rear backside, the huge DOORS...<br>
    that open out to space.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I will require some assistance.</p>
  <p> O'Brien and Data move to the transporter pad... begin<br>
    to make some PADD adjustments... Picard addresses Troi,<br>
    who really would rather not be bothered with him right<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Shumar, may I ask a<br>
    foolish question?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You are not one to ask foolish<br>
    questions, Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, I must ask how you<br>
    intend to achieve your &quot;rest&quot;...<br>
    when all is said and done...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 11/26/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>96 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do you intend to free yourself<br>
    of this existence that has<br>
    trapped your consciousness?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It will fade as we move further<br>
    from this planet...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really? What is your scientific<br>
    basis for that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    I don't need a scientific basis.<br>
    Just be quiet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you will be required to<br>
    perform a noble deed before you<br>
    can rest.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What are you talking about?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Surely you recall the old story<br>
    of &quot;The Canterville Ghost&quot;...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do not insult me with foolish<br>
    ghost stories, Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would ask the same of you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When are you going to tell me<br>
    who you really are?</p>
  <p> She stares at him... before she can answer... O'Brien<br>
    calls from the transporter controls --</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I have initialized the<br>
    transporter signal...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (still staring at<br>
    Picard)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Power Play&quot; - REV. 12/03/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>97 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    They're powering up the<br>
    transporter, Commander...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister LaForge...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've isolated cargo bay four with<br>
    a neutrino field, sir... But it<br>
    won't take O'Brien and Data more<br>
    than a couple of minutes to override<br>
    it once they discover it's<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope that'll be enough time<br>
    for the captain to play his<br>
    hand...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You know what he's going to do?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's only one reason he<br>
    chose cargo bay four...<br>
    (grim, to Ro)<br>
    If it becomes necessary, Ensign,<br>
    you will blow the cargo bay hatch<br>
    on my orders.</p>
  <p> They all react.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>98 INT. CARGO BAY - WIDE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien hits his panels... A large ENERGY CLOUD also<br>
    MATERIALIZES -- alive with hundreds of diving, flying<br>
    ENERGY RINGS (as in Act One). A powerful HUMMING takes<br>
    over, as if inside a hive.</p>

  <p>101 ON PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're quite right, Picard.<br>
    We're not ghosts. And it is not<br>
    rest, we seek. Only escape.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Escape?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We were brought to this moon over<br>
    five centuries ago from a star<br>
    system called Ux-Mal... We were<br>
    separated from our bodies and left<br>
    to drift in the storms. Once<br>
    we almost escaped... on board<br>
    the Essex... but that ship was<br>
    incapable of eluding the moon's<br>
    electromagnetic currents...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you really think using their<br>
    identities would gain our<br>
    sympathy... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was a better approach than<br>
    asking you to allow hundreds of<br>
    condemned prisoners on board...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, this moon is a penal<br>
    colony...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That is correct. But now<br>
    we have your ship... and your<br>
    bodies to carry us home...</p>
  <p>102 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Off tactical --</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    I think we can give the captain<br>
    a new bargaining chip. Doctor<br>
    Crusher, flood the cargo bay with<br>
    your containment field...</p>
  <p> Off an aft terminal -- as Beverly proceeds...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Let them go, or you will all die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your threats are meaningless now.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    We are still in control of these<br>
    three bodies. We will not leave<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you prepared to sacrifice the<br>
    lives of the others? Because they<br>
    will all die when the hatch to<br>
    the cargo bay is blown...</p>
  <p> They glance to the cargo bay door...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    You will die too...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I would die to save the life of<br>
    my child.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    To die defending his ship is the<br>
    hope of every Klingon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if you each know the officers<br>
    you inhabit, you know they are<br>
    equally ready to give their lives<br>
    for this ship.<br>

    Free them now... And I will return<br>
    you to the moon's surface.</p>
  <p> Troi studies him a long beat... realizing... she<br>

    I advise you, Picard, not to pass<br>
    our way again.</p>
  <p>104 ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The rings emerge from Troi, Data and O'Brien... they<br>
    each sag weakly to the floor while Data remains<br>
    standing, still. Keiko rushes to O'Brien who has<br>

    It was almost as though my own<br>

    What about the entity that<br>
