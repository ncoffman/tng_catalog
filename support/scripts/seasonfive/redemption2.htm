    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Hold a beat on the starry blackness... suddenly a BIRD<br>
    OF PREY comes tearing across the scene with DISRUPTOR<br>
    FIRE bursting all around it from o.c. ships. The Bird<br>
    of Prey takes a hit.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The ship ROCKS with the hit. KURN in command, WORF<br>
    at tactical, along with a HELMSMAN, and N.D. FIRST<br>
    OFFICER, &amp; ENGINEER at their stations. The bridge is<br>
    smoky... a couple of consoles have blown out and there<br>
    are one or two dead Klingons on the deck. The mood is<br>
    tense and urgent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aft shields buckling!</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Engineer)<br>
    Transfer auxiliary power to<br>
    shields!</p>
  <p> The ship is ROCKED again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aft shields are gone!</p>
  <p> Kurn doesn't respond... his expression is hardening.<br>
    Worf sizes up the situation... sees no point in a<br>
    hopeless struggle, but Kurn seems to be contemplating<br>
    just that option. Worf moves to Kurn.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    We cannot win. We must withdraw.</p>
  <p> Kurn's head snaps around. He keeps his voice low, but<br>
    there is real fire in his eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/8/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Keep your place!</p>
  <p> Worf has no choice but to acquiesce. He returns to<br>
    the tactical station as the ship is ROCKED again. All<br>
    eyes turn to Kurn. He waits a beat...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Helmsman)<br>
    New course... three zero seven...<br>
    mark two seven five.</p>
  <p> HELMSMAN<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    But sir---!</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (Do it!)<br>
    GhoS!</p>
  <p> The Helmsman works his console.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL) - KLINGON SHIPS</p>
  <p> The Bird of Prey is being pursued by TWO KLINGON<br>
    SHIPS. The Bird of Prey is heading directly for a star<br>
    in the b.g.</p>
  <p>4 INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is ROCKED AGAIN. The star looms larger and<br>
    larger on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are entering the star's<br>
    corona... we will reach the<br>
    photosphere in thirty seconds.</p>

    Stand-by to enter warp on my<br>
    command, course two five zero mark<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields failing... outer hull<br>
    temperature exceeding design<br>
    limits...</p>
  <p> Kurn doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p> Kurn is watching the viewscreen... waiting for the<br>
    right moment...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Maintain course...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They're closing on us!</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Helmsman)<br>

  <p> The Bird of Prey is heading directly into the star.<br>
    Just as it is about to enter the star, the ship turns,<br>
    goes into WARP SPEED, and heads away.</p>

  <p>10 NEW ANGLE - TWO KLINGON SHIPS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They were following the Bird of Prey too closely. They<br>
    try to turn away at the last second, but it's too late<br>
    and they fly right into the blazing sun and are<br>
    DESTROYED.</p>
  <p>10A INT. BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf and the others have new respect for Kurn, who<br>
    brought off this daring gamble.</p>

  <p>12A EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Hanging in space. A starbase is visible in the<br>
    background.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45020.4.<br>
    We have arrived at Starbase<br>
    Two-thirty-four, where I have<br>
    taken the opportunity to make a<br>
    proposal to Fleet Admiral<br>
    Shanthi.</p>
  <p>12B INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are seated across the table from FLEET<br>
    ADMIRAL SHANTHI and a N.D. STARFLEET ADMIRAL. Shanthi<br>
    is the head of Starfleet, and is a woman of African<br>
    descent in her late fifties with an almost regal<br>
    bearing. She is listening to Picard while the N.D.<br>
    Admiral looks on with disapproval.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There have been three major<br>
    engagements in the last two<br>
    weeks... all of them won by ships<br>
    loyal to the Duras family.</p>
  <p> SHANTHI<br>
    None of which is our concern,<br>
    Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war<br>
    is, by definition, an internal<br>
    matter of the Empire.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. But if the Duras are<br>
    being aided by the Romulans, then<br>
    it becomes very much our concern.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the plunge and forcefully lays out his<br>
    views as Shanthi watches him more closely</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Romulans have been trying to<br>
    destroy the Federation/Klingon<br>
    Alliance for over twenty years,<br>
    and at the same time, the Duras<br>
    have been secretly conspiring with<br>
    the Romulans.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doesn't it strike you as odd that<br>
    the Duras are able to field such<br>
    an overpowering force against<br>
    Gowron? That they outmatch him<br>
    at almost every turn?</p>
  <p> SHANTHI<br>
    Some would call it good<br>
    leadership.</p>
  <p> Picard refuses to let up... he's arguing with passion<br>
    and conviction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And some would say they must be<br>
    getting help.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Romulans have always been<br>
    willing to take enormous risks<br>
    in order to gain any advantage<br>
    over the Federation.<br>
    (with force)<br>
    Can we seriously believe that now,<br>
    with the future of the entire<br>
    Klingon Empire hanging in the<br>
    balance, they are content to<br>
    simply stand by and watch?</p>
  <p> There is a pause as Picard waits for a reaction.</p>
  <p> SHANTHI<br>
    What is it you propose, Captain?</p>
  <p> Riker suppresses a grin in the b.g.... the captain's<br>
    got her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/2/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We must stop the flow of supplies<br>
    and equipment from the Romulans<br>
    to the Duras family.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I propose we take a fleet of ships<br>
    to the Romulan/Klingon border.<br>
    We'll take no offensive action,<br>
    but we'll be in a position to<br>
    expose any Romulan shipments that<br>
    try to cross the border.</p>
  <p> SHANTHI<br>
    (musing)<br>
    A blockade...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But how will you overcome the<br>
    Romulan cloaking device?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My chief engineer has developed<br>
    a system that should help us<br>
    nullify that advantage. Each ship<br>
    will send out an active tachyon<br>
    beam to the other ships in the<br>
    blockade fleet. In theory, any<br>
    cloaked vessel that tries to pass<br>
    between our ships should cross<br>
    one of those beams and be<br>
    detected.</p>
  <p> Shanthi studies him silently for a moment and considers<br>
    his plan.</p>
  <p> SHANTHI<br>
    I'll have to clear this with the<br>
    Federation Council...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In the meantime, assemble your<br>
    fleet, Captain.</p>
  <p> With that, Shanthi and the N.D. Admiral EXIT. Picard<br>
    and Riker move to follow them and Riker quietly speaks<br>
    to Picard on their way out of the room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Nicely done... I hope you know<br>
    what you're doing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    So do I, Number One.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/2/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship in orbit near the starbase.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 45021.3.<br>
    Convincing Starfleet Command to<br>
    establish a blockade was<br>
    relatively painless.<br>
    Implementing that plan is proving<br>
    more troublesome.</p>
  <p>14 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker, DATA, and GEORDI are standing before Picard,<br>
    who is studying some PADDs they've brought him. They<br>
    contain lists of available ships.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starfleet is stretched pretty thin<br>
    across the quadrant. There are<br>
    only twelve ships within one day's<br>
    travel of this position.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The only other ships available<br>
    are either in spacedock for<br>
    repairs or still under<br>
    construction. Most of them don't<br>
    even have full crews yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But we could probably pick up<br>
    seven... maybe eight more ships.</p>
  <p> Picard ponders the PADD for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, will we be able<br>
    to implement your tachyon<br>
    detection grid with twenty ships?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    It's possible...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But the more ships, the bigger<br>
    the net we can throw.</p>
  <p> Picard drops into deep thought for a long beat... then<br>
    picks up the PADD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (decisive)<br>
    I want to add the Tian Nan Men,<br>
    the Hermes, and the Sutherland<br>
    to join us whether the yard<br>
    superintendent thinks they're<br>
    ready or not. Mister Data, select<br>
    a group of experienced officers<br>
    from the Enterprise to augment<br>
    the crews of those ships.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Will, I want you to command the<br>
    Excalibur. Her crew was<br>
    reassigned when she put in for<br>
    repairs. Geordi, you'll serve<br>
    as his first officer.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi give him confident nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to<br>
    everyone)<br>
    I want the fleet to be underway<br>
    by oh nine hundred tomorrow.<br>
    Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi EXIT, but Data remains behind with<br>
    a slightly puzzled look on his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask a question of a...<br>
    personal nature, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why have I not been assigned to<br>
    command a ship in the fleet?</p>
  <p> Picard is caught off-guard and is quite frankly<br>
    embarrassed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... I felt that you were<br>
    needed here.<br>
    (beat, then curious)<br>
    Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have commented on the lack<br>
    of senior officers available for<br>
    this mission. I believe that my<br>
    twenty-six years of Starfleet<br>
    service qualify me for such a<br>
    post.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, if you do not believe<br>
    the time has arrived for an<br>
    android to command a starship, then<br>
    perhaps I should address myself<br>
    to improving---</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander... I believe the<br>
    starship Sutherland will need a<br>
    captain. I can think of no one<br>
    more suited to the task than you.</p>
  <p> Picard holds out his hand and Data shakes it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Hold on Picard a beat...</p>

  <p>16 INT. KLINGON NIGHTCLUB</p>
  <p> If the Hell's Angels owned a posh country club, it<br>
    would look something like this. The club is designed<br>
    for food, drink, and merriment, Klingon-style. The<br>
    room is filled with N.D. KLINGONS and the atmosphere is<br>
    loud and raucous, with only a thin veneer of<br>
    civility... like a controlled riot.</p>
  <p> Some groups of Klingons can be seen drinking foul<br>
    concoctions and laughing uproariously... two large<br>
    Klingons continue to hit each other in the face and<br>
    laugh loudly following each blow as if that only made<br>
    the joke funnier.</p>
  <p>17 ON WORF</p>
  <p> As he ENTERS, carrying a PADD. In contrast to everyone<br>
    else, he glowers around at the scene of revelry. A<br>
    couple of Klingon women give him the eye as he passes,<br>
    but his interest lies elsewhere. He finally spots Kurn<br>
    sitting at a table with a Klingon captain named LARG.<br>
    He moves toward them.</p>
  <p>18 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Kurn and Larg are drinking and laughing loudly as Worf<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    You always did have fools working<br>
    for you, Larg... now you don't<br>
    have as many!</p>
  <p> Kurn slams the table and roars in laughter. Larg is<br>
    having a good time as well.</p>
  <p> LARG<br>
    You were lucky, Kurn... but luck<br>
    always runs out. Someday I will<br>
    stand over your broken corpse and<br>
    drink to the victory of the Duras!</p>
  <p> Larg laughs a hearty laugh and throws the flagon<br>
    against a wall. Kurn and Larg now notice Worf. Kurn<br>
    is pleased to see his brother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (stands and claps Worf<br>
    on shoulder)<br>
    Ah, Worf... good.<br>
    (indicates Larg)<br>
    This piece of baktag is Captain<br>
    Larg. He commanded the squadron<br>
    that tried to destroy us<br>
    yesterday.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't quite know how to react, so he simply<br>
    looks at Larg.</p>
  <p> LARG<br>
    (stands)<br>
    The infamous Worf, son of Mogh.<br>
    (pretends to looks Worf<br>
    over)<br>
    What are you wearing? That's the<br>
    uniform of a Klingon.</p>
  <p> Larg laughs and Worf starts to move toward him, but<br>
    Kurn lays a gentle, yet firmly restraining, hand on his<br>
    shoulder. Kurn's smile never fades, and although there<br>
    is laughter in his voice, it also contains just a hint<br>
    of warning.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    The Capital City is neutral<br>
    ground... and Larg's men are all<br>
    around us.<br>
    (beat, then pointed to<br>
    Larg)<br>
    As are mine.</p>
  <p> Larg and Kurn continue to smile at each other for a<br>
    minute. They're duelists who've met away from the<br>
    field of honor... tomorrow they'll happily kill each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> LARG<br>
    Good to drink with you, Kurn.<br>
    (pounds the pitcher<br>
    of drink on the table)<br>
    May you die well.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Die well, Larg.</p>
  <p> Larg moves away and Kurn watches him carefully, never<br>
    taking his eyes off Larg until he's safely away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (disapproving)<br>
    You drink with our enemy...</p>
  <p> They sit down. Kurn takes another long pull on his<br>
    drink and then leans in closer to Worf.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (indicates room)<br>
    How many are Gowron's men... how<br>
    many are Duras? Does it matter?<br>
    When we meet in battle we'll fight<br>
    to the death, but here... we're<br>
    all warriors... all Klingons.</p>
  <p> Worf nods... he understands the concept, but it still<br>
    runs against his personal grain. Kurn is relaxed,<br>
    thoroughly enjoying himself, but Worf can't seem to<br>
    unwind like his brother... he's a little too tightly<br>
    wrapped for that. Worf seeks refuge in<br>
    professionalism.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reading PADD)<br>
    The repairs on the Hegh'ta are<br>
    proceeding. The port stabilizers<br>
    are---</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Is there nothing in your heart<br>
    but duty?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is my responsibility to oversee<br>
    the repairs aboard ship.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    We all have responsibilities and<br>
    duties...<br>
    (with joy)<br>
    But we are warriors fighting in<br>
    a great war! Think of it... you<br>
    and I will fight battles others<br>
    can only dream of... our time for<br>
    glory is here. This is not the<br>
    time to worry about stabilizers.<br>
    (stands and shouts to<br>
    the crowd)<br>
    It is a time to celebrate... for<br>
    tomorrow we may die!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/2/91 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> The crowd ROARS its approval. The room is filled with<br>
    screaming Klingons for one insane moment...</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Come... let the sons of Mogh live<br>
    this night as if it were our last!</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates for a moment... then tosses aside the<br>
    PADD. Kurn clasps his brother on the shoulder, and<br>
    leads Worf over to the table where a Klingon game is<br>
    being played which is a combination of wrestling and<br>
    head-butting.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A different part of the club. LURSA and B'ETOR are<br>
    sitting at a table, watching Worf with interest as he<br>
    competes against another Klingon at the far table.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Worf is not like his brother.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    No. He tries to be... but he is<br>
    still unsure of himself.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    (lascivious)<br>
    Perhaps he needs something to help<br>
    restore his... confidence.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (smiles at her)<br>
    I think he'll find our offer<br>
    appealing.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    I'll make sure he does.</p>
  <p> B'Etor smiles to herself and then looks at Worf with<br>
    obvious sexual hunger.</p>

  <p>20 EXT. SPACE - THE SUTHERLAND (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A Nebula-class ship in spacedock.</p>
  <p>21 INT. SUTHERLAND - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> A smaller bridge than that of the Enterprise. N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS are hurrying around the bridge trying to<br>
    get the ship ready to go. Panels and consoles are<br>
    open, tools and boxes litter the floor and everything<br>
    has a rushed, unready look to it. LT. COMMANDER HOBSON<br>
    is berating some unfortunate N.D. ENGINEER just as Data<br>
    ENTERS from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    You've got to keep that mixture<br>
    above ninety percent or we'll<br>
    never leave orbit.</p>
  <p> The Engineer nods unhappily and then EXITS. Hobson<br>
    turns to see Data for the first time. They look at<br>
    each other for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am Lieutenant Commander Data.</p>
  <p> Everyone on the bridge stops what they're doing to look<br>
    with curiosity at Data.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Christopher<br>
    Hobson.</p>
  <p> Data takes no notice of Hobson's iciness and moves<br>
    quickly to the business at hand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    By order of Starfleet, I hereby<br>
    take command of this vessel.<br>
    Please note the time and date in<br>
    the ship's log.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    (tight)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Computer, what is the status of<br>
    the dilithium matrix?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/9/91 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data waits, but there is no acknowledgment beep from<br>
    the computer and Data looks at Hobson for an<br>
    explanation.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    The audio pick up circuits<br>
    aren't functioning. You can still<br>
    access the computer manually.</p>
  <p> Data nods and moves to a console. Activity on the<br>
    bridge resumes and after a beat, Hobson moves over to<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p>22 ON HOBSON AND DATA</p>
  <p> Data is working the console as Hobson moves to him.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Excuse me... sir?<br>
    (Data looks up)<br>
    I'd like to request a transfer.</p>
  <p> Data wasn't expecting that. He looks slightly puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask why?</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    I don't believe I would be... a<br>
    good first officer for you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your service record to date<br>
    suggests that you would perform<br>
    that function competently.</p>
  <p> Hobson tries not to be irritated at Data's turn of<br>
    phrase.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    That's not what I mean.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't think that I would be a<br>
    good first officer for you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/2/91 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Frankly, sir... I don't believe<br>
    in your ability to command this<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Data says nothing, his face impassive. Hobson has<br>
    taken the plunge... might as well lay it all out.<br>
    He speaks without anger, with a strictly professional<br>
    concern... which only makes his assessment more<br>
    damning.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're a fellow officer and I<br>
    respect that... but no one would<br>
    suggest that a Klingon would make<br>
    a good ship's counselor or that<br>
    a Berellian could be an<br>
    engineer. They're just not suited<br>
    for those positions.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    By the same token, I don't think<br>
    that an android is a good choice<br>
    to be captain.</p>
  <p> A beat as Data considers this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand your concerns.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Request denied.</p>
  <p> Data returns to working at the console and Hobson is<br>
    momentarily nonplussed... but then he tries to resign<br>
    himself to the task at hand and turns away to go back<br>
    to work.</p>

  <p>25 EXT. KLINGON CITY (MATTE)</p>
  <p> The Klingon Home World.</p>
  <p>26 INT. DURAS FAMILY HOME</p>
  <p> SELA (the Mysterious Woman from Part One) is arguing<br>
    with B'Etor while MOVAR (the Romulan General) and TORAL<br>
    (the Klingon boy) look on. Sela's attitude is crisp,<br>
    dispassionate... very Romulan. B'Etor is very<br>
    deferential to Sela... she clearly fears her.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    The Romulan convoy is late. We<br>
    need those supplies.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Gowron has suffered another loss<br>
    near the Mempa system. His forces<br>
    will not threaten you in that<br>
    region for some time.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>

  <p> SELA<br>
    (without raising her<br>

    The convoy will arrive in due<br>
    course.</p>
  <p> Sela ignores her and picks up a PADD. B'Etor looks<br>
    angry at her peremptory dismissal, but she won't<br>
    challenge Sela. Lursa ENTERS. She appears concerned,<br>
    but not panicked.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (to Sela)<br>
    A Federation fleet has just left<br>

    How many?</p>

    Should we attack them before they<br>
    get here?</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Silence the child, or send him<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> Toral bristles, but doesn't protest as B'Etor shuts<br>
    him up with a gesture. There is a long beat... then<br>
    Sela makes a decision.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Movar, I want you to return to<br>
    Romulus immediately.<br>
    (picks up PADD and taps<br>
    in something)<br>
    Have all available ships<br>
    rendezvous at these coordinates<br>
    in two days.</p>
  <p> She hands the PADD to Movar. He glances at them.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> Movar EXITS.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Twenty ships aren't enough to wage<br>
    a war... Starfleet must be<br>

  <p>27 INT. KLINGON GREAT HALL</p>
  <p> GOWRON is seated in the Leader's chair. Worf and<br>
    Kurn stand before him. Kurn is holding a PADD. A<br>
    Klingon named KULGE, and a couple N.D. KLINGONS are<br>
    standing in the b.g. Kurn is finishing a report and<br>
    Gowron is very unhappy.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Our forces in the Mempa sector<br>
    are now in full retreat. They<br>
    will have to regroup near Beta<br>
    Lankal.</p>
  <p> Gowron suppresses a curse.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (angry)<br>
    We destroyed their supply bases<br>
    in that sector three weeks ago!<br>
    How can they continue to fight?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    They must be getting help.</p>
  <p> Kulge's insolent voice is softly heard from the back<br>
    of the room.</p>
  <p> KULGE<br>
    Maybe they have better leaders.</p>
  <p> Gowron's eyes narrow. He knows that dissension can<br>
    spread quickly... he slowly stands. Kulge glances<br>
    around the room... there might be support for him here,<br>
    but no one's going to openly back him yet. Kulge<br>
    decides to go for it... he steps forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - 7/1/91 - ACT TWO 21A.</p>

  <p> KULGE<br>

    I say you have failed as our<br>
    leader, Gowron.</p>

  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Gowron gives a predatory smile and slowly takes off<br>
    his cloak. Worf can't believe what's going on and he<br>
    tries to intervene.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is no time for this! We<br>
    must make plans before those<br>
    forces reach Beta Lankal!</p>
  <p> Gowron and Kulge ignore him as they each start to<br>
    square off in the center of the room and everyone else<br>
    makes room for them. Worf turns to Kurn for some kind<br>
    of support.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How can we oppose the Duras when<br>
    we continue to fight among<br>
    ourselves?</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (simply)<br>
    Gowron must answer a challenge<br>
    to his authority.</p>
  <p> Gowron and Kulge have each pulled their knives and are<br>
    about to go at it. The other Klingons are yelling and<br>
    cheering them on. Worf feels things flying out of<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Kulge)<br>
    Stop this!<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    Are we to fall upon each other<br>
    like a pack of Ferengi? The enemy<br>
    is the Duras! We are at war!</p>
  <p> Gowron and Kulge ignore Worf. Kulge makes a move<br>
    toward Gowron and then Worf moves quickly to Kulge and<br>
    grabs hold of his knife hand. Gowron seizes the<br>
    opportunity that Worf's intervention has provided and<br>
    he lunges for Kulge. Worf is still holding Kulge's arm<br>
    and so Gowron is able to sink his knife deep into<br>
    Kulge's chest. He crumples to the ground. Worf is<br>
    shocked, but he's the only one.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>

    Now the war can continue.</p>

  <p> HOBSON<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    There wasn't enough time to test<br>
    all the back-ups before leaving<br>
    the yard.<br>
    (beat, then to N.D.<br>
    Crewman)<br>
    Terry, I want you down in<br>
    engineering working on a new<br>
    coupling.</p>
  <p> The Crewman EXITS and Hobson begins working the<br>
    console. Data watches the monitor with concern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have taken the phaser and<br>
    torpedo control units off-line.</p>
  <p> But Hobson isn't listening... he's taken charge here<br>
    and is giving orders to the two N.D. Crewmembers.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Keith, you and I'll start bringing<br>
    the coolant levels down in---</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Hobson, it is inappropriate<br>
    for you to determine a course of<br>
    action without consulting the<br>
    commanding officer.</p>
  <p> Hobson deliberately uses this opportunity to put Data<br>
    in a bad light and make him seem petty and<br>
    small-minded.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    I was trying to safeguard the<br>
    lives of people on those decks,<br>
    but you're right.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Belay those orders, everyone.<br>
    (works console)<br>
    The phasers and torpedos are back<br>
    on-line. What should we do, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Everyone is looking at Data. Hobson knows there's only<br>
    one course of action possible.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Take the phasers and torpedo units<br>
    off-line and begin repairs on the<br>
    starboard power coupling.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Thank you, sir.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    You heard the Captain, everyone.</p>
  <p> Hobson EXITS along with a couple Crewmembers, leaving<br>
    Data alone on the bridge... the initiative and command<br>
    authority seems to have left with Hobson. Data is<br>
    disturbed by the realization that he has a real problem<br>
    here.</p>

  <p>31A INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is at the aft science station watching two<br>
    monitors. One screen shows a schematic display of the<br>
    fleet, while the other shows Riker and Geordi on the<br>
    bridge of the Excalibur.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're ready, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, how long do you<br>
    think it will take the Romulans<br>
    to detect the tachyon field once<br>
    it's activated?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Not long... Romulan sensors are<br>
    as good as ours.</p>
  <p> Picard files that fact away for the time being.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Energize the network.</p>
  <p> Geordi bends to a console, taps commands.</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Captain, the net has picked up<br>
    five cloaked ships... they're<br>
    stationary... about five thousand<br>
    kilometers directly ahead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They've probably been sitting<br>
    there watching us for some time<br>
    now.</p>
  <p>36A INT. ROMULAN WARBIRD - COMMAND CENTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Romulan version of a ready room, it serves as more<br>
    than a mere office. There are monitors and consoles<br>
    which allow the commander to control the activities of<br>
    the ship or of a fleet without actually being on the<br>
    bridge. There is a single chair with a display console<br>
    before it. Sela and Movar are watching one of the<br>
    monitors which has a schematic display of the<br>
    Federation fleet on it.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    (reading console)<br>
    There is an increase in tachyon<br>
    emissions from the Federation<br>

  <p> Sela reaches down and taps a key. The monitor now<br>
    shows the tachyon beams which form the network. (The<br>
    image should be similar but not identical to the<br>
    graphic seen earlier on the Enterprise bridge.) Sela<br>
    studies the image for a beat.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    (nods in understanding)<br>
    They're using the beams as a<br>
    detection field...</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    If we try to cross it, they'll<br>
    see us... even if we're cloaked.</p>
  <p> Sela thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Issue orders to begin work on a<br>

  <p> Continuous action. Picard still looking at Sela on the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Deploying an invasion fleet along<br>
    our border is a clear act of<br>
    aggression, Captain. It will not<br>
    be tolerated. You have twenty<br>
    hours to recall your ships and<br>
    return peacefully to Federation<br>

    Then you believe her, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not saying we should accept<br>
    her claim at face value... but<br>
    I sensed no deception from her.<br>
    She really believes that she is<br>
    the daughter of Tasha Yar.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Regardless of what she believes,<br>
    Sela cannot be her daughter.<br>
    I've reviewed all of Tasha's<br>
    medical records, and there is no<br>
    indication that she was ever<br>
    pregnant.</p>

    Sela could have been cloned.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Or had her appearance surgically<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    But why? What possible advantage<br>
    do the Romulans think they would<br>
    gain?</p>
  <p> No one has a good answer for that. Picard thinks for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As it now stands, I don't see how<br>
    this has any impact on our present<br>
    strategy. We'll continue the<br>

    to them.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Troi EXIT, leaving Picard alone.</p>

    Am I intruding?</p>
  <p>43B NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard turns to find GUINAN standing quietly at the<br>
    door. Picard is a little surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>43B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Word travels fast. I heard that<br>
    Tasha Yar's daughter is on the<br>
    Romulan ship.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't want to give this rumor any credence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think the Romulans have created<br>
    what they hope will be a<br>
    distraction... something to keep<br>
    us off balance.</p>
  <p> Guinan eyes him, gauging his tone.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Is that what you really think?<br>
    Or is there some part of you...<br>
    that wonders?</p>
  <p> Picard says nothing, but she has touched something.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Because part of me does...</p>
  <p> She moves toward him for a silent moment... picking<br>
    her way cautiously through what she knows will sound<br>
    far-fetched.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    How much do you know about what<br>
    happened to the last ship named<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> A frown. Curious question... but he searches his<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise C? It was lost...<br>
    at the battle of Narendra Three...<br>
    while defending a Klingon outpost<br>
    from the Romulans.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    And... the survivors?</p>
  <p> He regards her, perplexed. Where is this leading? But<br>
    Guinan is an old and trusted friend. He'll follow<br>
    along.</p>

  <p>43B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There were stories... that there<br>
    might have been prisoners, taken<br>
    back to Romulus. But those were<br>
    just rumors.</p>
  <p> She moves still closer to him, struggling with<br>
    thoughts, feelings, memories... all of them a jumble<br>
    that makes no sense. And yet...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    There were survivors. And one<br>
    of them was Tasha Yar.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at her. Is she out of her mind?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>43B CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guinan... that was twenty-three<br>
    years ago... Tasha was still a<br>
    child...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know. But I also know she was<br>
    on that ship -- and she wasn't<br>
    a child.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And Picard... you sent her there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How could you know these things?</p>
  <p> Guinan turns away from him, frustrated, struggling to<br>
    make sense of all this.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I don't know how I know. I just<br>
    do.<br>
    (turning back to him)<br>
    I remember it.</p>
  <p> She moves close again, her mind grasping at the elusive<br>
    imagery.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I can see her.. in my mind...<br>
    asking me a question...<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    And then it's gone...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tasha died... a year before you<br>
    came to the Enterprise. You never<br>
    met her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know that... but I also know<br>
    I'm right.</p>
  <p> Picard isn't sure what to make of all this, but he<br>
    tries to take a more pragmatic approach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you have nothing more than a<br>
    vague intuition...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/8/91 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>43B CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's all I have. But I listen<br>
    to it... and you should do the<br>
    same.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't know what to say. He's been through<br>
    enough with Guinan not to dismiss what she says. She<br>
    senses his resistance lessening.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You can't just dismiss this. If<br>
    I'm right... if you did send<br>
    Tasha Yar on that ship... then,<br>
    in a way, Picard... you're<br>
    responsible for her daughter.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard absorbs this. Then --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think... it's time I met<br>

  <p>45 INT. KLINGON NIGHTCLUB</p>
  <p> As seen before. The place is as rowdy and raucous as<br>
    ever. Worf and Kurn are in deep discussion at a table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are at war! Gowron should<br>
    forbid any challenges until we<br>
    are victorious.</p>
  <p> Kurn looks at his brother as if he'd lost his mind.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    A Klingon does not... postpone<br>
    a matter of honor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon should place the good<br>
    of the Empire above his own pride!</p>
  <p> Kurn's had about enough of this. His temper starts to<br>
    build.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    So now Gowron no longer suits<br>
    you... perhaps you mean to<br>
    challenge him for the leadership<br>
    of the Council?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (hot)<br>
    Then do not speak of this again!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I did not wish to follow Gowron...<br>
    you came to me and insisted we<br>
    support him against the Duras<br>
    family. The time for debate is<br>
    over!</p>
  <p> Kurn stands. The two brothers look at each other for a<br>

  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We are Klingons. He is our<br>
    leader. If that is not enough<br>
    for you, then perhaps you made<br>
    the wrong choice when you put on<br>
    that uniform.</p>
  <p> Kurn EXITS, and Worf is forced to think about where he<br>
    is and what he's doing.</p>
  <p>46 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Including TWO KLINGONS who've been watching Kurn and<br>
    Worf all this time. After Kurn leaves, they glance at<br>
    each other and then move toward Worf. They move<br>
    casually behind him... trying not to attract<br>
    attention... then they try to jump Worf. There is a<br>
    scuffle. Worf struggles gamely, but cannot overcome<br>
    the two strongarms. They manage to overpower him,<br>
    knocking him unconscious. They drag him out of the<br>
    nightclub, and the crowd simply considers it an<br>
    everyday occurence in the club.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>47 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard is waiting near the windows. Sela and an N.D.<br>
    SECURITY GUARD ENTER. Picard nods to the guard, who<br>
    then EXITS. Sela immediately strides into the room,<br>
    looking around, pacing like a jungle cat, covering the<br>
    room as though marking territory. She is lithe,<br>
    genial, confident -- and definitely going for the upper<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Well, Captain... what is this<br>
    &quot;urgent matter&quot; we need to<br>
    discuss?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid you misinterpret our<br>
    presence here. I want to reassure<br>
    you that we have no hostile<br>
    intentions.</p>
  <p> Sela's eyes twinkle with amusement.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Ah. Then I can report to my<br>
    superiors that a fleet of<br>
    twenty-three Federation starships<br>
    is on our border for...<br>
    humanitarian reasons?<br>
    (a smile)<br>
    I doubt they are so gullible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is most certainly our intent<br>
    to prevent any external power from<br>
    interfering in Klingon affairs.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Nor do we have any plan to do so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But Captain... if for any reason<br>
    we chose to enter Klingon<br>
    territory... how would you stop<br>
    us? With our cloaking devices<br>
    we can slip by you at will.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/9/91 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at this. She is clearly looking for<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why not send your ships<br>
    across?</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    You sound eager for us to try...<br>
    perhaps you've discovered a method<br>
    of detecting our ships...</p>
  <p> He eyes her, expression noncommittal and lets her<br>
    statement hang in the air. Sela is not quite sure what<br>
    he has or what he knows, and continuing to fence with<br>
    him might simply reveal her hand. She decides to<br>
    change tacks. She sprawls into a chair and gives him a<br>
    lazy smile.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    However... I don't think you<br>
    asked me here to discuss our<br>
    military situation.</p>
  <p> She holds his look, challenging. But it isn't easy<br>
    to regain the advantage from Jean-Luc Picard. He<br>
    smiles back at her, sits easily.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Why did I invite you?</p>
  <p> She leans toward him confidently.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    You want the answer to the only<br>
    real question on your mind... how<br>
    could Tasha Yar be my mother?</p>
  <p> He leans right back into her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's been suggested that Tasha<br>
    was aboard the Enterprise-C when<br>
    it was destroyed twenty-four years<br>
    ago. She was one of the<br>
    survivors. You are obviously the<br>
    product of a union between her<br>
    and a Romulan.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/9/91 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> This takes Sela aback. She is completely unprepared<br>
    for Picard to have any of this knowledge. She is<br>
    losing a bit of her assurance.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    But... you know that's impossible.<br>
    She would have been a child when<br>
    that battle occurred...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet you claim that it is<br>
    possible -- that Tasha Yar was<br>
    your mother.</p>
  <p> She flushes. She finds herself on the defensive<br>
    without quite knowing how she got there.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Yes... she was on that ship<br>
    twenty-four years ago.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She was sent there... by you...<br>
    from the future.</p>
  <p> Picard is hearing what Guinan suggested to him... but<br>
    he cannot reveal his amazement. He wants to keep her<br>
    talking -- to explain this bizarre set of<br>
    circumstances.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    She was among those few who<br>
    survived. They were all to have<br>
    been executed after their<br>
    interrogation. But a Romulan<br>

  <p> Picard has listened intently... mind straining to grasp<br>
    the imponderables. There are still unanswered<br>

    young woman with the proud bearing and quick<br>
    intelligence is Tasha's daughter. Still, he<br>
    challenges.</p>

    I want to meet her.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your mother. Is she still alive?</p>
  <p> A contemptuous look crosses Sela's face. She returns<br>
    to Picard, sits near him.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    One night... when I was four...<br>
    she came to me, bundled me up and<br>
    told me to stay quiet as we left<br>
    the compound.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I realized she was taking me<br>
    away... away from my home, away<br>
    from my father... so I cried out.</p>
  <p> For a brief moment, she cannot hold his eye. There<br>
    are complex, ambivalent feelings warring in her. But<br>
    she continues...</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    My father had offered her life.<br>
    He had given her a home, given<br>
    her a daughter. How did she repay<br>
    him? With betrayal.</p>
  <p> And then, looking at him again...</p>

  <p> There is a sense of something else in her attitude...<br>
    a vulnerability perhaps... some conflicting emotions<br>
    just beneath the surface. But then she draws herself<br>
    up, her face a Romulan mask again.</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Everything in me that was human...<br>
    died with my mother that day.<br>
    All that is left... is Romulan.<br>
    Never doubt that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doubts? I'm full of them.<br>
    Nothing in my experience can assure<br>
    me that what you say is true...<br>
    but I do know one thing: it will<br>
    not affect my judgment in our<br>
    next encounter.</p>
  <p> She turns to the door, then back to him:</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    You have fourteen hours, Captain.<br>
    I suggest you use them wisely.</p>
  <p> And she exits to the security guard who is waiting<br>
    outside the door. Picard stares after her, mind<br>
    reeling from the profound complexities of this strange<br>
    encounter.</p>

    look of warning and she retreats again, but she's<br>
    enjoying this.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Our brother made many mistakes...<br>
    one was to make you an enemy.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    We would rather be your friends.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then you should not have opposed<br>
    Gowron.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>

    Gowron is nothing.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>

    one thing... Toral is not ready<br>
    to rule the Empire.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    But we are... with your help.</p>
  <p> Worf looks from one to the other... he's curious as<br>
    to what this is all about.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My help?</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Toral needs guidance...</p>

  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    (heavy with sexual<br>

    The rewards... could be greater<br>

  <p> LURSA<br>
    When the forces that follow you<br>
    and your brother are united with<br>
    ours... nothing will stand in<br>
    our way.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    The Empire would be ours to rule<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    Join us, Worf... and we will usher<br>
    in a new era for our people.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a beat to digest all this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with anger)<br>
    An era where honor has no<br>

  <p> Hobson reads a message on the monitor.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    The Enterprise wants to know the<br>
    reason we've stopped.</p>
  <p> Hobson looks toward Data to respond, but Data ignores<br>
    him.</p>

    area.</p>
  <p> New splotches appear.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    (tight)<br>
    Sir. This is pointless. Those<br>
    readings could be anything.<br>
    There's no way for us to prove<br>
    the Romulans are out there.</p>
  <p> Data is thinking furiously... he makes a decision.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Reconfigure the photon torpedo<br>
    warhead yields. Set for a high-<br>
    energy burst at level six.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    At level six? But that won't<br>
    even---</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> Hobson works his console with frustration.</p>

    Another message coming in... it's<br>
    Captain Picard!</p>
  <p> Hobson hits a key.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Mister Data, you were ordered to<br>
    rendezvous with the fleet at<br>
    Gamma Eridon. Acknowledge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stand by, Captain.<br>
    (steady, to Hobson)<br>
    Mister Hobson, prepare to fire.</p>
  <p> HOBSON<br>
    Didn't you hear that? Picard<br>
    wants us---</p>

  <p>67 EXT. SPACE - THE SUTHERLAND (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship FIRES photon torpedoes.</p>
  <p>68 ON ROMULAN SHIPS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The torpedoes streak out at what seems to be empty<br>
    space. They explode, and in so doing they illuminate<br>
    THREE ROMULAN SHIPS. We can't actually see the ships,<br>
    just the telltale tachyon signatures that surround<br>
    them... the effect is similar to seeing several<br>
    Christmas trees suddenly lit up in space.</p>
  <p>69 INT. ROMULAN WARBIRD - COMMAND CENTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Movar and Sela watching a monitor in astonishment.<br>
    The monitor shows the illuminated Romulan ships as seen<br>
    above.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    They have discovered us!</p>
  <p> Sela's expression clouds... this is a very difficult<br>
    decision to make. After a long beat...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/8/91 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    Reverse course. Order the fleet<br>
    back to Romulan territory.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    (upset)<br>
    Commander! The Duras need this<br>
    convoy. Without these supplies,<br>
    they cannot win!</p>
  <p> SELA<br>
    (firm)<br>
    We've been exposed. It's over.</p>
  <p> MOVAR<br>
    But what should I tell Lursa and<br>
    B'Etor?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The reconfigured particles from<br>

  <p> Hobson smiles and looks at Data with newfound respect.<br>
    Data shows no reaction, as usual.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Make a full report to the<br>

    off-line and begin radiation<br>

  <p>72 INT. DURAS FAMILY HOME</p>
  <p> Toral is waiting nervously as Lursa and B'Etor ENTER,<br>
    their faces grim. Toral looks to them for an answer.<br>
    A glance between the sisters before B'Etor provides a<br>
    simple explanation.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    Defeat.</p>
  <p> Toral is horrified.</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    How? Where are the Romulans?</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (bitter)<br>
    They never came.</p>
  <p> An EXPLOSION IS HEARD in the distance. Lursa and<br>
    B'Etor react.</p>
  <p>73 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The Romulan Guard seen earlier ENTERS with Worf. Worf<br>
    looks like hell... they must have really worked him<br>
    over because he can barely stand. Lursa looks him over<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (to Romulan, re: Worf)<br>
    Kill him.</p>
  <p> As Lursa and B'Etor move to the far side of the room,<br>
    the following happens very quickly:</p>
  <p> AN EXPLOSION IS HEARD from very close outside the<br>
    door, startling everyone. Worf uses this momentary<br>
    distraction to dispatch the Guard with a few<br>
    well-placed blows to the knees and stomach.</p>
  <p>74 ON LURSA &amp; B'ETOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The sisters don't care about Worf, the Guard, or<br>
    Toral, they're bitter over the defeat and just want to<br>
    get the hell out of here. Lursa pulls a small device<br>
    from a pocket and activates it as Toral moves to join<br>
    them, but he doesn't move quickly enough and the<br>
    sisters DEMATERIALIZE in a transporter beam. Toral<br>
    is shocked that they've left without him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/9/91 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    No!!</p>
  <p> At that moment, the door bursts open and a couple of<br>
    heavily armed N.D. KLINGONS ENTER with Kurn close<br>
    behind. Kurn goes to his brother... Worf almost<br>
    collapses, but Kurn catches him before he falls and<br>
    Worf is able to steady himself against the wall. Kurn<br>
    finally notices Toral.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    Toral... next Leader of the<br>
    Empire.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Gowron is looking forward to<br>
    seeing you again.</p>
  <p> Toral tries not to show the terror gripping him... but<br>
    he's not quite successful.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's personal log,<br>
    supplemental. It is with a<br>
    profound sense of relief that I<br>
    have ordered the fleet back to<br>
    Federation territory following<br>
    the news of Gowron's victory.</p>
  <p>76 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard at his desk, looking over a report on his<br>
    terminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have arrived at the Klingon<br>
    Home World, where I will present<br>
    the High Council with a full<br>
    report on our encounter with the<br>
    Romulans.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/8/91 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.) (cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am also... anxious to learn of<br>
    Worf's fate.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I wish to submit myself for<br>
    disciplinary action<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    I disobeyed a direct order from<br>
    a superior officer. Although<br>
    there was a positive outcome as<br>
    a result of my actions, I have<br>
    learned that... the ends cannot<br>
    justify the means.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, they can't.<br>
    (thoughtful beat)<br>
    However... the excuse &quot;I was only<br>
    following orders&quot; is the epitaph<br>
    of too many tragedies in our<br>
    history. Starfleet does not want<br>
    officers who will blindly follow<br>
    orders without analyzing the<br>
    situation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Your actions were appropriate for<br>
    the circumstance, and I have noted<br>
    that in your record.</p>
  <p> Data turns to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data...</p>
  <p> Data stops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (less formal)<br>
    Nicely done.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/15/91 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>76 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Hold on Picard as he allows himself to<br>
    smile slightly at how well Data has learned.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>77 INT. KLINGON GREAT HALL</p>
  <p> Gowron is in the leader's chair, and the KLINGON<br>
    COUNCIL is now standing beside him. Picard stands<br>
    before the Council. Gowron is looking at a Starfleet<br>
    PADD.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (looks up at Picard)<br>
    The Council appreciates your<br>
    report, Captain. The information<br>
    on the Romulan supply ships will<br>
    prove very useful.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Before you leave, there is one<br>
    last matter to attend to.</p>
  <p> Gowron nods to someone o.c.</p>
  <p>77A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Kurn and Worf ENTER. Worf looks much better than<br>
    we last saw him, but there are still some scars visible,<br>
    and he has a slight limp. Worf straightens at the<br>
    sight of Picard, and the two men share a silent moment<br>
    of reunion. But there is still other business to<br>
    attend to...</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Bring him!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/15/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>78 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As a KLINGON GUARD ENTERS with Toral. The boy keeps<br>
    his head up, determined to go out like a Klingon.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    Toral, son of Duras... you stand<br>
    convicted of treason.</p>
  <p> Toral musters his courage.</p>
  <p> TORAL<br>
    The Duras family will one day rule<br>
    the Empire!</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Perhaps... but not today.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf steps forward.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (continuing, to Worf)<br>
    This child's family wrongly took<br>
    your name and your honor from<br>
    you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In return, I give his life... to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Gowron hands Worf a knife and steps back. Toral tries<br>
    to steady himself as everyone watches.</p>
  <p>79 ON WORF</p>
  <p> He struggles... is this what being Klingon really<br>
    means? Worf looks up at Picard, who is watching to see<br>
    what he will do. Worf and Picard share a silent<br>
    moment... Worf looks from the captain to the knife in<br>
    his hand... finally drops the knife to the ground.<br>
    A buzz of confusion goes around the room. Kurn moves<br>
    quickly to his brother.</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (quiet, urgent)<br>
    What's wrong? Kill him!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Redemption II&quot; - REV. 7/3/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KURN<br>
    (incredulous)<br>
    This is our way... the Klingon<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with glance at Picard)<br>
    I know... but it is not my way.<br>
    (beat, to Gowron)<br>
    This boy has done me no harm...<br>
    and I will not kill him for the<br>
    crimes of his family.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Then it falls to Kurn.</p>
  <p> He gestures to the knife. But before Kurn can move--<br>
    <br>
    WORF<br>
    No. You gave his life to me...<br>
    and I have spared it.</p>
  <p> Gowron frowns... he's puzzled, but decides not to push<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> Worf moves toward Picard.</p>
  <p>80 OMITTED</p>
  <p>81 ON WORF &amp; PICARD</p>
  <p> Worf and Picard look at each other for a beat...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Permission to return to duty, sir?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted.</p>
  <p> They EXIT together, never looking back.</p>
