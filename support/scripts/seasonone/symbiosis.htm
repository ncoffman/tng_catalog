    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving toward a brilliant sun. Even from here the<br>
    TURBULENCE on the surface of the sun is evident.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    All hands, this is the captain.<br>
    The sun in the Delos system is<br>
    undergoing large-scale magnetic<br>
    field changes, producing violent,<br>
    gigantic flares.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS</p>
  <p> in corridors, Engineering, and so on as the ship's<br>
    company listens to their captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We will be studying this star<br>
    at close range. Even though we<br>
    will be running with full<br>
    deflectors, the closeness of the<br>
    event and its severity are going<br>
    to create problems.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The bridge is manned as usual. WESLEY is at the Aft<br>
    Science Station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Intense magnetic fields have a<br>
    disruptive effect on electrical<br>
    systems. We can therefore expect<br>
    an interruption of communications,<br>
    and potential temporary loss of<br>
    other systems. As a precaution,<br>
    we are now going to Yellow<br>
    Alert...</p>
  <p> He signals Tasha with a nod of his head and she<br>
    ACTIVATES the system.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Stay sharp, everyone.</p>
  <p>4 OMITTED</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> As technicians keep close watch on their stations.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Engineering, this is Ops. Bring<br>
    all systems on line and direct<br>
    full power to the shields.</p>
  <p> The technicians carry out Data's order.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard takes his seat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All sections secure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Course set.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Half impulse.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Half impulse, aye.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it MOVES PAST CAMERA toward the dazzling sun.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Everyone is intent:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>9 SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great sun FILLS THE SCREEN WITH LIGHT. WE CAN<br>
    SEE no definition -- only intensity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mask out the photosphere.</p>
  <p> While we watch, the intensity of the sun itself is<br>
    MATTED OUT, LEAVING ONLY THE RIM which is erupting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify. Quadrant one-seven,<br>
    sector four-zero-three.</p>
  <p> And now WE can clearly SEE on the surface. Great,<br>
    powerful FLARES extend out above the rim.</p>
  <p>10 REACTIONS</p>
  <p> As they watch the wondrous eruptions on the surface<br>
    of the sun.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never seen anything like<br>
    this before. The violence of<br>
    these eruptions is awesome.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And humbling, Number One.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Reading an unusual number of<br>
    sunspots and eruptive prominences,<br>
    sir. The magnetic field is<br>
    extremely irregular.</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves in closer to the Delos sun.</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley makes an adjustment at his Science Station.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, deflectors are being hit<br>
    by a huge burst of X-rays.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> And all at once, Wesley's console is BATHED WITH A BLUE<br>
    AURORA; we HEAR STATIC SOUNDS. Wesley pulls back, more<br>
    delighted than alarmed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wow -- look!<br>
    (getting professional)<br>
    Sir, my console seems to be<br>
    overloading.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The X-ray burst is disrupting<br>
    systems, Captain. I'm adjusting<br>
    deflectors to compensate.</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> They are also having difficulty. The intensity of the<br>
    radiation is affecting control systems.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Increase power to forward deflectors.</p>
  <p>14 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The AURORA EFFECT on the Science Station DIES OUT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Status report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    All systems operational, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain. The level of tension<br>
    on the ship is mounting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understandable. Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we are to investigate this<br>
    unusual solar activity -- we must<br>
    get closer.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for just a beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, move us closer.</p>
  <p> Picard studies the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We'll be pushing our deflectors<br>
    to the limit, but we'll get a good<br>
    look at this phenomenon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I have intercepted what<br>
    seems to be a distress signal.</p>
  <p> Everyone's attention turns to this new emergency.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me hear it.</p>
  <p> VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    This... (garbled) -- this is<br>
    ... (garbled) -- on the freighter<br>
    Sanction... (garbled) ... and<br>
    unable to... (garbled) .... Need<br>
    help.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The transmission is from a<br>
    freighter in orbit around the<br>
    fourth planet of the system.<br>
    However, the receiving station<br>
    is on the third planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing frequency.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unidentified freighter, this is<br>
    the USS Enterprise. May we be<br>
    of assistance?</p>
  <p> On the viewscreen the IMAGE IS CLUTTERED WITH STATIC.</p>
  <p> T'JON (V.O)<br>
    (a garbled response)<br>
    Whoever you are, YES!<br>
    (garbled) .... cannot maintain...<br>
    (garbled) ... if you can help...</p>
  <p> Picard listening.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can't you enhance the image?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Too much interference.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set a course to intersect with<br>
    the freighter. Warp two.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maintain Yellow Alert.</p>
  <p> T'JON (V.O.)<br>
    Can't control... (garbled) ... ship<br>
    is losing orbit... (garbled) ...<br>
    heading into atmosphere...<br>
    without help, we'll burn up.</p>
  <p> As Picard and Riker exchange a concerned glance:</p>
  <p>15 OMITTED</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> coming out of warp.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Everyone is alert.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a freighter -- very old.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, our sensors are being<br>
    severely affected by the sun<br>
    flares.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Helm -- get us in as close as<br>
    possible to the freighter's<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are six life forms aboard<br>
    the freighter.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the freighter's orbit<br>
    is decaying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long until it loses integrity?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A matter of minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (he touches his<br>
    arm-panel)<br>
    Unidentified freighter, this is<br>
    the USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> There is a moment of hesitation where all that is heard<br>
    is STATIC, then:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    Enterprise, this is the Aurelian<br>
    freighter... Sanction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put this on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p>18 MAIN VIEWER - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Screen is a clutter of LINES and SWIRLS.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    The visual transmission is still<br>
    breaking up.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen REPAINTS WITH THE FREIGHTER IN ORBIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Freighter, this is the Enterprise.<br>
    What is your situation?</p>
  <p> T'JON (V.O.)<br>
    ... (garbled) ... We are...</p>
  <p> Several OTHER VOICES call out:</p>
  <p> SOBI (V.O.)<br>
    Get us off here.</p>
  <p> LANGOR (V.O.)<br>
    (female)<br>
    Please -- help us.</p>
  <p> These desperate pleas are mixed with the OTHER VOICES<br>
    and added to the STATIC making this transmission<br>
    unintelligible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the Enterprise -- with<br>
    all this interference it is<br>
    difficult to copy your<br>
    transmission -- if you all talk<br>
    at once... it is impossible. Now<br>
    -- please -- say again. What is<br>
    your situation?</p>
  <p> Again there is a lot of STATIC -- then some shouting<br>
    in the background and finally ONE MALE VOICE.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    I am T'Jon -- the captain of the<br>
    Sanction.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is pleased that T'Jon's voice is calm and under<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    At last.<br>
    (to T'Jon)<br>
    How can we help?</p>
  <p> There are raised VOICES SHOUTING to get them off. Then<br>
    T'Jon again restores order.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have lost -- I don't know...<br>
    something -- and I am no longer<br>
    able to maintain this orbit, nor<br>
    am I able to use main thrusters.<br>
    Everything's just kind of... you<br>
    know... dead, I guess. It's<br>
    all... you know... shut down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's very vague. What's the<br>
    computer analysis?</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    The computer's not working very<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data... can you tap into their<br>
    computer and clarify the<br>
    situation?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will attempt it.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, the tractor beam is<br>
    available, if you want it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At least we can pull them out of<br>
    orbit before they enter the<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Captain T'Jon -- we are<br>
    going to lock on our tractor beam<br>
    and pull you out of orbit.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Hey -- that's great.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> In the background there are two excited VOICES to<br>
    counterpoint T'Jon's matter of fact response.</p>
  <p>19 ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> as she enters the information to set and lock the<br>
    tractor beams.</p>
  <p>20 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND FREIGHTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the TRACTOR BEAM reaches out. It's TORN AND<br>
    RAGGEDY.</p>
  <p>21 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Tasha re-enters the information. Her panel indicates<br>
    a malfunction.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    The solar flares are interfering<br>
    with the tractor beam, Captain.<br>
    I am unable to lock on.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the freighter's orbit<br>
    continues to deteriorate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain T'Jon, we are unable to<br>
    attach our tractor beam because<br>
    of the intense solar activity.</p>
  <p> T'JON (V.O.)<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    I understand.<br>
    (giving up)<br>
    Thanks for trying.</p>
  <p> Again in the background there are panicky CRIES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I have determined what<br>
    is malfunctioning on the<br>
    freighter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise to Sanction. We have<br>
    analyzed your problem.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Great.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard gestures to Data to go ahead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your ship's design uses an<br>
    electromagnetic coil to constrict<br>
    the exhaust flow. That coil is<br>
    misaligned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you the necessary tools to<br>
    realign the coil?</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    I don't think so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I believe we can provide<br>
    the freighter with a temporary<br>
    substitute. Ship's stores contain<br>
    a coil of the proper type.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Can we beam it over?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain T'Jon, we will beam over<br>
    a replacement coil.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    That's great... and that will fix<br>
    us up?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, once it's installed.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Right.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    ... And how do we do that?</p>
  <p> Picard is dumbfounded. He glances over at Riker. Both<br>
    men are amazed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the matter with these<br>
    people? How can he be the captain<br>
    of the vessel and be ignorant of<br>
    its simplest functions?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If this weren't so serious it<br>
    would make you laugh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain T'Jon -- how long have<br>
    you been in command of the<br>
    freighter?</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Seven years. This is my<br>
    twenty-sixth voyage to Brekka.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you don't know how to align<br>
    a control coil?</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's never come up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there anyone on board who can<br>
    do it?</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Hold on a minute... I'll ask.</p>
  <p> There is a pause.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry -- nobody here knows<br>
    anything about it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll beam over with a team.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain -- I strongly recommend<br>
    against anyone from this ship<br>
    beaming over. The solar<br>
    interference is too great.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain T'Jon. Prepare to beam<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    If you think that's best.</p>
  <p> Picard is getting more than a little impatient with<br>
    T'Jon and his lack of concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unless you have another option<br>
    -- yes, I &quot;think that's best.&quot;</p>

  <p> Off Picard's REACTION.</p>
  <p>22 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and Tasha ENTER. Tasha goes directly to the<br>
    console, takes over from a Transporter Chief, and<br>
    begins trying to lock on to the life forms on the<br>
    freighter.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I can't maintain a positive lock.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Freighter Sanction, this is the<br>
    Enterprise. We are having<br>
    difficulty getting a fix.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Have them go to their own<br>
    Transporter Room. It will be<br>
    tricky, but perhaps I can link<br>
    the two transporters in series<br>
    and get them over with the<br>
    increased power.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's worth a try.<br>
    (to intercom)<br>
    Captain T'Jon -- go immediately<br>
    to your Transporter Room.<br>
    Contact me from there.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    (still very calm)<br>
    Right, Enterprise -- we'll call<br>
    you from there... but, if you<br>
    can't get us with your<br>
    transporter, what makes you think<br>
    ours will do the job?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'm going to interconnect them.</p>
  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    I didn't know you could do that.</p>

  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    One minute, twenty-eight seconds.</p>
  <p> Tasha taps the console.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>

  <p> T'JON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yeah. We're in the transporter<br>

  <p> TASHA<br>
    Great. Activate your transporter.<br>

  <p> Tasha at the console.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Then all six of you get on the<br>

  <p> She exchanges a look of exasperation with Riker.</p>

    Riker and Tasha are astounded.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Unbelievable.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're losing the freighter.<br>
    You've got to beam those people<br>
    over now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Clear that cargo. Beam it to a<br>
    hold.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Tasha hits a control. The barrel DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 19.</p>

    Freighter Sanction... this is the<br>
    Enterprise, get on the transporter<br>

    (to Tasha)<br>
    Forget it. Just lock on to any<br>
    life forms you can find and get<br>
    them over.</p>

    We've no choice. Energize.</p>
  <p>37 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>

    look over the new arrivals.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Two are lost, sir. But we saved<br>
    four.</p>
  <p> On the transporter pad are the four humanoids: T'JON,<br>
    ROMAS, and SOBI (three males) as well as LANGOR (a<br>
    female). They are instantly divided into pairs -<br>
    because of the physical differences, clothing and<br>
    manner.</p>
  <p> T'Jon and Romas, of the planet Ornara, are scruffy,<br>
    unclean, and almost wild in appearance. Their manner<br>
    is nervous, belligerent, somewhat high-strung. In<br>
    contrast, Sobi and Langor, of the planet Brekka, are<br>
    attractive, well-dressed, well-groomed, intelligent,<br>
    and genteel.</p>
  <p> Riker STEPS FORWARD.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander William Riker of<br>
    the USS Enterprise.<br>
    (solemnly)<br>
    I'm sorry. We were unable to<br>
    rescue the other two.</p>
  <p> The four aliens REACT with indifference.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Were they with you...<br>
    (then indicating the<br>
    other pair)<br>
    ... or with you?</p>
  <p> Something else is on their minds.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (nearly frantic)<br>
    With us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We did everything we could, if<br>
    you had come instead of the cargo,<br>
    you could have all made it.</p>
  <p> T'Jon looks around - near panic.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    The cargo... Where is it?</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (also panicking)<br>
    You did save it, didn't you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (mystified)<br>
    Yes, we did. It's in one of our<br>
    cargo holds. You act like it's<br>
    more important than your comrades.</p>
  <p> Judging by their reactions, Riker's right.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    May we see it?</p>
  <p>39A INT. CARGO BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The alien cargo is in the cargo bay. The DOORS OPEN<br>
    and Riker, Tasha, T'Jon, Romas, Sobi, and Langor ENTER.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As they catch sight of the cargo, Sobi and Langor are<br>
    gratified; T'Jon and Romas are ecstatic.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Thank you. It's just we thought<br>
    we had lost it.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (casually)<br>
    Careful with your choice of words,<br>
    T'Jon. It's ours, not yours.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (heating up)<br>
    We paid a fair price for it!</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    You offered a fair price, but we<br>
    have not received it.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    You accepted our goods in trade!</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Then where are they? Tell me!</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    That's not our problem!</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    No more than the barrel is your<br>
    property. It's as simple as this.<br>
    The goods were never delivered;<br>
    they were destroyed with your<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Hence the deal was incomplete;<br>
    hence possession of the Felicium<br>
    remains ours!</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (a plea)<br>
    We need it.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander, I request you transport<br>
    my associate --<br>
    (nods to Langor)<br>
    -- and myself down to our planet,<br>
    with our merchandise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Yes, get them out of here! But<br>
    the barrel stays.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    (to Sobi)<br>
    There's no reasoning with you.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (to her)<br>
    Langor, you expect too much from<br>
    them. You always have and you<br>
    are always disappointed.<br>
    (then to T'Jon with a<br>
    hard edge)<br>
    You didn't pay -- so it's not<br>
    yours.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Damn you, Sobi --</p>
  <p> T'Jon grabs Sobi's arm -- and there is a FLASH OF<br>
    SPARKS as the bodies touch. Sobi grimaces in pain,<br>
    grabs back at T'Jon. Another FLASH OF SPARKS, this<br>
    time hurting T'Jon.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (drawing her phaser)<br>
    Stop this! Now!</p>
  <p>40 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as a free-for-all continues. Sobi and T'Jon grapple,<br>
    and we HEAR SPARKING NOISES as their electrical fields<br>
    try to cancel each other out. Romas tries to rush to<br>
    T'Jon's aid; Langor grabs Romas's arm. More SPARKS.<br>
    Riker touches a com panel:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Security to Cargo Bay Eleven!</p>
  <p> Tasha makes and adjustment on her phaser and fires.<br>
    T'Jon and Sobi are SLIGHTLY stunned by the blast.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Behave yourselves, Gentlemen.</p>
  <p> They both &quot;brush themselves off,&quot; shoot each other<br>
    hostile looks, but the physical part of their dispute<br>
    is, for the moment, resolved.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 24.</p>

    opposite them. Two security personnel are standing<br>
    a few feet away. T'Jon and Romas are changing -- they<br>
    are becoming slightly more frantic; their condition<br>
    will continue to deteriorate.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    We have to resolve this. There<br>
    isn't much time.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    What can you offer?</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Everything we had went down with<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what can you tell me about<br>
    the inhabitants of this system?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not very much, sir. The only<br>
    recorded contact with the Delos<br>
    system was over two hundred years<br>
    ago. A scout ship reported two<br>
    inhabited planets, both<br>
    technologically just on the edge<br>
    of acquiring space travel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Odd that in two centuries, neither<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Sir, I find it strange that none<br>
    of our visitors feel much remorse<br>
    about the two freighter passengers<br>
    who perished... yet their barrel<br>
    of cargo is a source of great<br>
    anxiety to them.</p>

    Yes, let us pay a call and get<br>
    some answers. Counselor, Number<br>

  <p>43 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> As before. Riker, Picard, Troi, and Data ENTER. Riker<br>
    performs introductions:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, may I present Sobi and<br>
    Langor from the planet Brekka,<br>
    which we are now orbiting. And<br>
    T'Jon and Romas... from the<br>
    neighboring planet, Ornara.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am sorry we could not save your<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    You could have repaired it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    We have only two left. Neither<br>
    works. They are critical to our<br>
    survival. Could you fix them?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our computer downloaded the<br>
    specifications for the magnetic<br>
    coils the freighters depend on,<br>
    sir. Assuming the malfunction<br>
    is similar... suitable<br>
    replacements can be fabricated.</p>
  <p> All the visitors are relieved. It's the first time<br>
    they have had similar reactions to an event.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Instruct Engineering to proceed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Now, as for our cargo...</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Our cargo, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    Wrong, Sobi --</p>
  <p> Picard jumps in to forestall the argument.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My first officer has said<br>
    ownership of the cargo is in<br>
    dispute. This is a question which<br>
    must be settled by whatever legal<br>
    mechanisms exist between your<br>
    societies.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Captain Picard, you don't<br>
    understand. This is a matter of<br>
    life and death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why is that? What is the cargo?</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Medicine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    Our home planet is in desperate<br>
    need, Captain. Ornara suffers<br>
    from a lethal plague.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    The cargo you have impounded<br>
    represents the only hope of life<br>
    for our people.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Sobi and Langor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that right?</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    You must think us heartless<br>
    brutes, Captain, but look at our<br>
    side of it. The plant which<br>
    yields the medicine Felicium grows<br>
    only in remote areas of our home<br>
    planet Brekka.</p>

    It must be painstakingly<br>
    cultivated, harvested, and<br>
    purified... a complex and<br>
    expensive process.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    That single shipment of Felicium<br>
    represents an enormous investment.<br>
    We can't just give it away!</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    We paid for it.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    We are asking only for what is<br>
    ours.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    That is your viewpoint. Ours,<br>
    of course, differs.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    You are going to hold to that<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Sobi spreads his hands helplessly.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    I am constrained to abide by the<br>
    terms of our agreement.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (with quiet intensity)<br>
    Then you condemn us to death!</p>
  <p> T'Jon tries to calm his companion:</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Romas --</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (to Sobi and Langor)<br>
    You disgust me! If you saw the<br>
    suffering the plague has brought,<br>
    would you still be so heartless?</p>
  <p> He makes a small gesture.</p>

  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We are going to get to find out,<br>
    when you see what the plague does<br>
    to us.</p>
  <p> Picard is stunned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Romas -- you and T'Jon carry the<br>
    disease?</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (bitterly)<br>
    Yes. Every Ornaran does.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you may have brought it<br>
    aboard my ship!<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Was there a medical scan during<br>
    transport?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Unverified -- the solar flares may<br>
    have caused a malfunction in the<br>
    biofilters --</p>
  <p> An alarmed Picard doesn't wait for the rest. He slaps<br>
    a com panel.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>44 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The solar flares continue to dance around the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>45 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> With a security team guarding the doorway, Beverly<br>
    scans the four visitors. The Brekkians, Sobi and<br>
    Langor, seem perfectly healthy. They are relaxed and<br>
    smiling.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    You find us well, I trust?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As far as I can tell. Your<br>
    physiology is somewhat different<br>
    but I detect no dangerous virus<br>
    or bacteria.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    I assure you we are in perfect<br>
    health.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves over to examine the Ornarans. In<br>
    contrast to the Brekkians, T'Jon and Romas look quite<br>
    sickly -- they are both antsy and sweaty.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    We're not! We need our medicine.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (correcting)<br>
    Our medicine.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    We paid for it -- it's ours now!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Enough!</p>
  <p> The visitors glare at each other.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Of course you are right, Doctor.<br>
    Could we leave now?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see no reason why not.<br>
    (to the security guard)<br>
    Escort them to their quarters.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. Beverly leaves her four &quot;patients&quot; and<br>
    goes to her office. The visitors all look<br>
    apprehensive. Each realizes that Captain Picard holds<br>
    their future in his hands.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Captain, could I talk with you<br>
    please... in private.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not right now.</p>
  <p> And he FOLLOWS Beverly INTO her office.</p>
  <p>45A INT. DR. CRUSHER'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What have you learned?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Brekkians are free of<br>
    infection. The Ornarans have all<br>
    the symptoms of a disease -- but<br>
    I can't find a cause.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps the transporter filtered<br>
    it out when they were beamed<br>
    aboard?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    There's no record of it. Then<br>
    again, the solar flare activity<br>
    may have caused a transporter<br>
    malfunction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are they going to die?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The physiology is somewhat<br>
    different from ours, so I need<br>
    to check further, but... my<br>
    instinct says no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you think we are in danger from<br>
    this plague?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Again, I don't think so, but I<br>
    need more time to know for sure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are some missing pieces to<br>
    the puzzle, don't you feel that<br>
    too?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's missing here is a little<br>
    humanity.</p>
  <p> Picard gives her a little look of surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Are we losing our professional<br>
    detachment, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps. As Captain, I think you<br>
    should know that I am developing<br>
    a very active dislike of the<br>
    Brekkians.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understandable.</p>
  <p> Hold on Beverly as Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p>45B INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS OVER TO the aliens. T'Jon is very nervous<br>
    and anxious.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Captain, you must give us back<br>
    our cargo.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't do that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>45B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Why not? It belongs to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the Brekkians insist it is<br>
    theirs.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    They lie!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe so, but it's not for me to<br>
    decide.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (losing his composure)<br>
    We need some now... NOW! I don't<br>
    care if it's your 'decision' or<br>
    not... get us some!</p>
  <p> T'JON silences Romas with a gesture; T'Jon attempts<br>
    to speak calmly.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Captain, what's happening to us,<br>
    is happening to thousands more<br>
    on Ornara. Please understand the<br>
    magnitude of the problem.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Your people don't need it --<br>
    (indicating the<br>
    Brekkians)<br>
    -- they don't need it... our<br>
    people do!</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    If you don't give it to us, you<br>
    will be party to murder... not<br>
    only us, but an entire<br>
    civilization!</p>
  <p> Instantly, T'Jon realizes he's gone too far:</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry, I did not mean to insult<br>
    you. I'm feeling very shaky.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    We cannot hold out much longer!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>45B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, Captain -- I think they should<br>
    have it. They believe it will<br>
    help them. That in itself might<br>
    control their symptoms.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to the Ornarans.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll talk with the Brekkians.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Thank you, Captain. I appreciate<br>
    anything you can do.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and EXITS.</p>
  <p>46 INT. BREKKIAN'S GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Sobi and Langor are relaxing in their quarters. They<br>
    have adapted quickly to the creature comforts the<br>
    Enterprise has to offer. Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    May I say, Captain, how impressed<br>
    we are with your ship and its<br>
    facilities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    And its crew. Everyone is so<br>
    efficient and professional.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am glad you are comfortable.<br>
    I've come to seek your agreement<br>
    to an Ornaran request.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    We cannot --</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Wait. Let the Captain speak.<br>
    We want to be reasonable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Langor's control of the situation does not go unnoticed<br>
    by Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Ornarans are quite ill and<br>
    are insistent that they need<br>
    Felicium.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    That is not surprising.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then would you object to allowing<br>
    them enough Felicium for their<br>
    immediate needs?</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Captain, we Brekkians are in<br>
    business -- we are not in the<br>
    habit of giving away what has not<br>
    been paid for.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You would let them die rather than<br>
    share the medicine?</p>
  <p> Sobi and Langor exchange a look.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    We want to be fair, Captain. We<br>
    agree to permitting them two<br>
    dosages for immediate use.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (magnanimous)<br>
    No charge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll have our medical officer<br>
    handle it.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    I trust you won't mind if we are<br>
    present while you open the cargo,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> The Captain gestures politely to come along.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Data, Sobi, Langor, two science<br>
    officers, and a security team are gathered around the<br>
    barrel of Felicium. Using a strange set of<br>
    contraptions, a minuscule amount of Felicium is<br>
    extracted from the barrel.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Point-zero-one milliliters is the<br>
    proper individual dosage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (impressed)<br>
    A very potent substance.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    We've perfected our distillation<br>
    process over the years. In my<br>
    grandfather's day, the same amount<br>
    of Felicium would have filled five<br>
    rooms this size, Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No doubt you have applied your<br>
    technology from other industries<br>
    to the refinement of this product.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    We have no other industry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    None at all?</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    We don't need any. The Ornarans<br>
    provide us everything we need --<br>
    in exchange for this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fascinating. Your society<br>
    dedicated exclusively to the<br>
    production of a single product.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A product for which you have no<br>
    use for, but which the Ornarans<br>
    can't live without.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    One of the little ironies of life,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    But one we'd be fools not to take<br>
    advantage of. It is mutually<br>
    beneficial.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    The Ornarans provide us with the<br>
    necessities of life and we provide<br>
    them with the necessities of<br>
    living. It is a fair exchange.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    A most interesting relationship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Excuse me... I'll take this to<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p>48 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> T'Jon and Romas prepare to dose themselves as Beverly<br>
    watches. Each person on Ornara has a device for<br>
    administering the drug. It's a small cylinder which<br>
    converts the Felicium into something which is then<br>
    injected into the fat part of the hand just below the<br>
    thumb.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Can I help?</p>
  <p> T'Jon<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    (to his friend)<br>
    Hurry up!</p>
  <p> T'Jon takes the dosage devise (NOTE: it should not look<br>
    like something currently used by doctors or dopers)<br>
    and presses it against Romas hand. Romas immediately<br>
    REACTS. He relaxes -- the tension leaves him -- then<br>
    slowly he smiles.</p>
  <p> T'Jon doses himself. Instantly, his former edginess<br>
    vanishes; a wave of calm comes over him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are feeling better?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Yes. Thank you. I'm fine now.</p>
  <p> T'Jon and Romas are totally blissed out. We HOLD on<br>
    Beverly's look of concern.</p>
  <p>49 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors OPEN and Beverly ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report, Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I may not know Felicium's full<br>
    effect on Ornaran physiology.<br>
    But I know how to interpret<br>
    physical reactions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are the Ornarans recovering?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Both T'Jon and Romas are fine...<br>
    in fact, too fine.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Felicium is a narcotic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then T'Jon, Romas -- indeed every<br>
    Ornaran --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    -- is a drug addict.</p>
  <p> ON the Captain's expression of concern, WE:</p>

  <p>53 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Data is seated working at a computer screen. Picard<br>
    ENTERS, immediately FOLLOWED BY Riker and Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a fascinating little tale<br>
    we've run into of disease -- rescue<br>
    -- commerce -- and interdependence<br>
    between two worlds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have piqued my interest,<br>
    Number One -- please continue.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Beginning several thousand years<br>
    ago, the two worlds took different<br>
    paths. Ornara became technically<br>
    sophisticated, Brekka did not.<br>
    Then two hundred years ago Ornara<br>
    was stricken by a devastating<br>
    plague.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their advanced technology could<br>
    offer no solution.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Somehow, and there is limited<br>
    information on this point, the<br>
    cure was found in a plant which<br>
    is indigenous to only Brekka, and<br>
    which resisted all attempts at<br>
    cultivation on Ornara.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In any case a trading situation<br>
    quickly developed, which still<br>
    exists.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Ornarans acquire the Felicium<br>
    from the Brekkians, and in<br>
    exchange, the Ornarans provide<br>
    the Brekkians with foods and<br>
    staples.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (O.S.)<br>
    A nice arrangement for the<br>
    Brekkians.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And for the Ornarans -- without<br>
    the medicine they would all die.</p>
  <p> Beverly JOINS the others. She has her diagnostic<br>
    device in her hand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No they wouldn't. Captain, here<br>
    are the results of my analysis.<br>
    Felicium is definitely a powerful<br>
    and addictive narcotic. What's<br>
    more, despite what the Ornarans<br>
    have been saying, it's not a<br>
    medicine. It was a medicine, and<br>
    it did cure the plague, two<br>
    hundred years ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And they no longer need it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The plague is irrelevant now: it<br>
    doesn't exist... and it's not<br>
    going to recur.</p>
  <p> Off their REACTIONS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Ornarans have no medical need<br>
    for Felicium.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No, but their physical and<br>
    psychological need is very real.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There is a long pause. Everyone slowly looks toward<br>
    Picard, and for a beat, Picard is pensive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What are you going to do?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Based on what we know so far...<br>
    there is nothing I can do.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And you don't think drug addiction<br>
    and exploitation is sufficient<br>
    cause?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This situation has existed for<br>
    a very long time. Those two<br>
    societies are intertwined in a<br>
    symbiotic relationship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    With one society profiting at the<br>
    expense of the other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's how you see it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can synthesize a non-addictive<br>
    substitute which will ease their<br>
    withdrawal symptoms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We can't do that either.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know this. You can't let them<br>
    have the Felicium.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Because it goes against our<br>
    moral sensibilities? Our mission<br>
    is not to force Federation or<br>
    Earth values on others in the<br>
    galaxy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In this case... you're wrong,<br>
    Captain. One hundred percent<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, I am receiving a call<br>
    from Ornara.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Patch it in here.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    The signal's ragged, but I think<br>
    I can put it on the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> Picard turns the viewscreen so the others in the room<br>
    can see. The SCREEN LIGHTS UP with a less than perfect<br>
    picture of MARGAN.</p>
  <p> MARGAN<br>
    I am Margan. Are my people on<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some of them, yes.</p>
  <p> MARGAN<br>
    May I speak with them?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (touching his com panel)<br>
    Lieutenant Yar, have the Ornarans<br>
    brought in... no, wait, I don't<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>53A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    I can understand how this could<br>
    happen to the Ornarans... What<br>
    I can't understand is why anyone<br>
    would voluntarily become dependent<br>
    upon a chemical.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (checking readouts)<br>
    Yet, the voluntary addiction to<br>
    drugs is a recurrent theme in many<br>
    cultures.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    As in the twenty-first century...<br>
    when Earth governments used<br>
    narcotics to control the military.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Or look at the twentieth century.<br>
    The dangers of drug abuse were<br>
    well known, yet their use was<br>
    commonplace.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is what I do not understand.</p>
  <p> Tasha overhears, STEPS UP.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No one wants to become dependent.<br>
    That happens later.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But it does happen. So why do<br>
    people even start?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Oh, lots of reasons... My home<br>
    planet was a place of great<br>
    poverty and violence. For some,<br>
    the only escape was through drugs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I fail to comprehend how a<br>
    chemical substance can provide<br>
    an escape.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>53A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It doesn't. But it makes you<br>
    think it does.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You have to understand -- drugs<br>
    can make you feel good.</p>
  <p> Wesley and Data listen intently.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They put you on top of the world.<br>
    You're happy... Sure of yourself.<br>
    In control. A lot of people never<br>
    feel that otherwise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But it is artificial.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It doesn't feel artificial. It<br>
    feels natural, good, and mind<br>
    expanding.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Until the drug wears off. Then<br>
    you pay the price. Once you come<br>
    down, you're lower than when you<br>
    started. So you take the drug<br>
    again -- and it kicks you back<br>
    up. But not as high this time.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    So you take more.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    But each peak gets lower and<br>
    the valleys get deeper. Before<br>
    you know it -- you're taking the<br>
    drug not to feel good but to keep<br>
    from feeling bad.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And that's the trap.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You think the drug expands your<br>
    universe -- but it actually<br>
    shrinks it. Shrinks it to where<br>
    you and the drug are all that's<br>
    left.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>53A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TASHA (Cont'd)<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Pretty soon, all you care about<br>
    is getting your next dosage.<br>
    You'll lie, cheat, steal --<br>
    anything to get that fix.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainly by then you would<br>
    realize the danger.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That's the worst of it. You don't<br>
    care. The drug is your salvation<br>
    -- your survival. Nothing else<br>
    is important.</p>
  <p> Wesley thinks it over and, after a beat, shakes his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I guess I just don't understand.</p>
  <p> Tasha smiles and puts a hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Wesley, I hope you never do.</p>

  <p> MARGAN<br>
    T'Jon. Have you got it?</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Well, it's here, but...</p>
  <p> MARGAN<br>
    You've got to get it to us.<br>
    T'Jon... please... We're dying<br>
    here. You don't know... this is<br>
    the worst it's ever been.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>56A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> T'Jon is visibly moved by what he is hearing.</p>

    I'm doing everything I can.<br>

  <p> From Picard and T'Jon.</p>
  <p> MARGAN<br>
    (cuts him off)<br>
    Stop. I can't listen. T'Jon...<br>
    we need the medicine. So, many<br>
    people... so much suffering.<br>
    You've got to get it to us. I<br>
    can't... I can't go on. Help,<br>
    T'Jon... please.</p>
  <p> The SCREEN SHUTS OFF. For a beat everyone is quiet.<br>
    The strain on T'Jon is very evident. The pressure is<br>
    enormous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> T'Jon then turns and puts a death grip on the person<br>
    nearest to him. Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Take us to our planet - leave us<br>
    there with our medicine or this<br>
    person dies.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a STEP FORWARD, then STOPS.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't you see -- I have no choice.<br>
    We were sent to bring back the<br>
    Felicium. The suffering on my<br>
    planet is too great. People are<br>
    dying. It doesn't matter any more<br>
    whether we are entitled to the<br>
    Felicium... we have to have it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let him go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>56B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Take us there now -- or give us<br>
    a shuttle -- but we must have the<br>
    medicine... if you refuse, this<br>
    person dies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not be coerced.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    I'll do it. I'll kill him.</p>
  <p> The strain of the pressure is all over T'Jon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    No you won't. You're not a killer<br>
    and neither am I.</p>
  <p> T'Jon releases Riker, who sags a little, then catches<br>
    his balance.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Help us... please... help us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure that I can.</p>

  <p>62A INT. ORNARAN GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> As they all stand and consider what to do. Langor<br>
    APPEARS AT THE DOOR.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Captain Picard, we couldn't help<br>
    overhearing. Could I see you for<br>
    a moment?</p>
  <p> Picard is almost relieved by the distraction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come with me, Doctor. This could<br>
    be interesting.</p>
  <p>63 INT. BREKKIAN GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly are there with Langor and Sobi.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    We have thought about this a great<br>
    deal.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    Both of us feel deeply about what<br>
    is happening on Ornara.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Although this is going to cause<br>
    hardship to us and to our people,<br>
    we have decided to give the<br>
    Felicium to them.</p>
  <p> A slow smile plays at the corners of Picard's mouth.<br>
    Beverly's expression is harsh.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    They can pay for it when they are<br>
    able.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    We don't want to cause any<br>
    suffering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> For a beat Picard doesn't answer. Both Beverly and<br>
    Picard make the connection at the same time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    I wonder why I expected this.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Pardon?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's the other shoe.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Langor)<br>
    The Ornarans are not aware, are<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Of what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That the plague which nearly<br>
    destroyed Ornara... infected your<br>
    world as well.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    You don't know that for sure.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It had to.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But somehow, one of your ancestors<br>
    realized that your desire for the<br>
    drug continued after the disease<br>
    had been cured. They made the<br>
    connection and were able to end<br>
    their addiction.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (scornful)<br>
    But these same wonderful people<br>
    also realized that their neighbors<br>
    never found out. Their need for<br>
    the drug grew to the point it is<br>
    now. Your sole source of support<br>
    comes from providing the narcotic.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the refinement process of<br>
    which you are so proud was a way<br>
    to make Felicium even more<br>
    addicting... and tighten your<br>
    grip on the Ornarans even further.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    Are you going to tell them?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I can't tell them. You see,<br>
    I am bound by the rules of the<br>
    United Federation of Planets,<br>
    which say I am not to interfere<br>
    in other worlds, other cultures.<br>
    To tell them any of this would<br>
    be interfering and would violate<br>
    the Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (suspicious)<br>
    You're talking to us about it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Telling you things you already<br>
    know... which changes nothing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc. I can synthesize<br>
    something which will alleviate<br>
    their suffering and make<br>
    withdrawal painless.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    That won't be necessary, because<br>
    if I understand the captain, he<br>
    is going to allow the Ornarans<br>
    to have the Felicium.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I am.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You can't do that. Some things<br>
    go beyond words on a page. These<br>
    Brekkians have knowingly enslaved<br>
    others. They have caused untold<br>
    suffering and hardship, just so<br>
    their pitiful lives could be<br>
    easier. At least don't give the<br>
    Ornarans more drugs.</p>

  <p>63 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is not for me to make any of<br>
    these decisions.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    You are absolutely right, Captain.</p>
  <p> Sobi and Langor are smug.</p>

    for this gathering, along with the parts which have<br>
    been fabricated for the Ornaran freighters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, we've arrived at Ornara<br>
    and assumed standard orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Acknowledged. Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard CROSSES to stand in front of the four aliens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Forgive me for doing what I must.<br>
    (to T'Jon and Romas)<br>
    I'm beaming you down to your<br>
    world... with your Felicium.</p>
  <p> T'Jon and Romas are delighted.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    Good. I knew it would work out<br>
    this way.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    You've made the only humanitarian<br>
    decision, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard nods joylessly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Symbiosis&quot; - 2/17/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>67A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    (to T'Jon)<br>
    Langor and I will beam down to<br>
    Ornara with you.</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    We'll work out payment terms for<br>
    the Felicium.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    On behalf of my people, I extend<br>
    thanks for your benevolent<br>
    attitude.</p>
  <p> Sobi and Langor smile proudly. Beverly is fuming at<br>
    the hypocrisy, but keeps it hidden.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I also thank you, Captain,<br>
    for doing the right thing.</p>
  <p> Romas indicates the coils.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    Your gift of these coils will<br>
    ensure that our freighters will<br>
    continue to work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    (confused)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not supply you with spare<br>
    parts for your freighters. If<br>
    you want them repaired, you'll<br>
    have to do that yourself.</p>
  <p> The four aliens are stunned.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    In a short time our freighters<br>
    will be inoperable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite possibly.</p>

  <p> T'JON<br>
    But we depend on those freighters!<br>
    We must have those parts.</p>
  <p> SOBI<br>
    If you withhold those coils,<br>
    you're disrupting the stability<br>
    of both our planets --</p>
  <p> LANGOR<br>
    -- and interfering with a trade<br>
    arrangement that has lasted for<br>
    generations! What of this Prime<br>
    Directive of yours?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing in the Prime Directive<br>
    compels me to help you.</p>
  <p> ROMAS<br>
    You're an executioner, Captain.<br>
    You want our world to perish.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. That's not what I want.</p>
  <p> T'JON<br>
    But without our freighters, there<br>
    will be no more shipments of<br>
    Felicium! We will die!</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't respond. Beverly is empathetic:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You must trust in yourselves.<br>
    There are... other options.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you must understand that my<br>
    oath as a Starfleet officer gives<br>
    me no choice in the matter.</p>
  <p> The four aliens stare at him, unable to comprehend how<br>
    Picard can do this to them. Picard touches a com panel.</p>
