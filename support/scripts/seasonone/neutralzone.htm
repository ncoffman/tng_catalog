  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 OMITTED</p>
  <p>2 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship is motionless as it awaits the return of<br>
    its captain. A short distance off, and APPEARING very<br>
    small, is another vehicle - also drifting.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First officer's log, stardate 41986.0.<br>
    The captain has left the ship for<br>
    a conference and we are awaiting<br>
    his return. It is unusual for us<br>
    to be motionless, and a unique<br>
    experience for everyone concerned.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> GEORDI is at Conn - WORF at Tactical - DATA at Science<br>
    One, RIKER is in the Command position. Troi is off the<br>
    bridge in her office. Everyone is looking at the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is quite intriguing. It is<br>
    transmitting a carrier signal on<br>
    a frequency which has not been used<br>
    for centuries.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there a message?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None. Just the carrier, possibly<br>
    intended for encoded computer or<br>
    telemetry information.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have never seen a space vehicle<br>
    like it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Strictly speaking, it is not a<br>
    &quot;space vehicle.&quot; It appears to<br>
    be a satellite, similar in its<br>
    rudimentary design to those which<br>
    orbited Earth in the late<br>
    twentieth and early twenty-first<br>
    centuries.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Three hundred years ago.<br>
    (mostly as a joke)<br>
    Then there probably aren't any<br>
    life signs?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None.</p>
  <p> Data continues studying the readout.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The power is solar... quite<br>
    primitive. There is however<br>
    minimum life support.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wonder how it got out here.<br>
    If it was in orbit around Earth,<br>
    even at maximum impulse -- and<br>
    there's no way it could travel<br>
    any faster, it would have taken<br>
    a dozen centuries to get here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    At its present speed and heading,<br>
    the vehicle will eventually enter<br>
    the Kazis Binary system and will<br>
    certainly be destroyed.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to face Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sir, I could attach a tractor beam<br>
    and adjust its heading.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think not, Mister Worf. It's just<br>
    a piece of space debris. If we<br>
    weren't sitting here waiting for<br>
    the captain, we wouldn't have even<br>
    noticed it. Leave it be. Let<br>
    nature take its course. How long<br>
    until Captain Picard returns?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The last communication indicated<br>
    it would be several hours.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, request permission to<br>
    investigate this vehicle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why, Data? It's just a derelict.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a piece of history. The<br>
    opportunity to examine such an<br>
    ancient vehicle does not come<br>
    around very often, and as you<br>
    pointed out, we do have the time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right, Data. But be ready<br>
    to beam back before the captain<br>
    returns.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Worf -- go with him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The two EXIT the bridge.</p>

  <p>7 INT. DERELICT - SMALL CONTROL AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as they BEAM IN. They are in a small control area.<br>
    The equipment we see is late twentieth century in<br>
    design. Worf is tense -- ready for the unexpected.<br>
    Data scans the area with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - TEASER 4.</p>

  <p> Nothing happens.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Computer...</p>
  <p> Data interrupts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In the late twentieth century,<br>
    computers were not voice activated,<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Data examines the keyboard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Notice the readouts -- dials,<br>
    needle machines, gauges.<br>
    Remarkable what they used three<br>
    centuries ago. The on-board<br>
    computers have ceased functioning.<br>
    I may be able to download this old<br>
    style disk drive back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>8 WORF</p>
  <p> APPROACHES the door, clearly expecting it to slide open.<br>
    He waves a hand in front of it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It must be sealed -- probably<br>
    with age. I will blast it open.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not necessary.</p>
  <p> He reaches down and turns a handle, physically slides<br>
    the door OPEN.</p>
  <p>9 INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM</p>
  <p> They move forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>10 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> Riker is sitting at the Command Chair.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, this is Riker. What<br>
    have you found?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Very little so far.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have picked up the captain's<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    E.T.A.?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Twelve minutes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Alert Main Shuttle Bay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>11 INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM</p>
  <p> As Worf and Data ENTER the other compartment they see a<br>
    series of crypts, lining both sides of the room. Each<br>
    glass-covered and coffin-like in design, with a<br>
    computerized panel above it. The panel both monitors<br>
    and controls the crypt.</p>
  <p>12 CRYPT</p>
  <p> As Data clears away the frost TO REVEAL a shriveled<br>
    human form. It's all BLACKENED AND HIDEOUS. Data<br>
    REACTS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The seal was broken and the<br>
    environment has been corrupted.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the next crypt. Beside him, Worf wipes<br>
    the frost from a third crypt. He has found another<br>
    shriveled form.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Here's another.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data wipes away the frost from the crypt by him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This one is empty.</p>
  <p> He easily lifts the cover.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It has been forced open and the<br>
    occupant removed.</p>
  <p> In the b.g. Worf is wiping the frost from another<br>
    crypt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander. Look at this.</p>
  <p> Data steps over.</p>
  <p>12A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Through the hole which Worf has wiped in the frost,<br>
    WE CAN SEE a human -- a WOMAN. About thirty-five,<br>
    attractive and unconscious.</p>
  <p> OFF Worf and Data's REACTIONS, WE:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/21/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>12B INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf and Data are still beside the frozen woman.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Has she been frozen for an<br>
    extended journey?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If that were the purpose, there<br>
    would be evidence of a more<br>
    sophisticated monitoring system.<br>
    This container is designed solely<br>
    for refrigeration.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is the destination?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe they were going<br>
    anywhere. This vehicle should<br>
    still be in Earth orbit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is no way it could break<br>
    orbit and travel this distance<br>
    on its own power. Not in three<br>
    hundred years -- not in three<br>
    thousand. Some intelligent lifeform<br>
    must have brought it to<br>
    this section of the galaxy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (indicating the crypts<br>
    with the shriveled<br>
    forms)<br>
    These crypts were opened.<br>
    (indicating the empty<br>
    crypts)<br>
    The occupants in those were taken.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why take some of them, destroy<br>
    others, and leave her apparently<br>
    untouched?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps they learned all they<br>
    could from the others. We may<br>
    never know.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/21/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data moves down the line of crypts, wipes another To<br>

  <p>13 OMITTED</p>
  <p>14 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data and Worf have for the moment been forgotten.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The captain's shuttle is<br>
    approaching Main Shuttle Bay.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise, this is the captain.<br>
    Number One, I want to get underway<br>
    as soon as the shuttle is secure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir. We will make all<br>
    preparations.<br>
    (to the Away Team)<br>
    Commander Data, return to the<br>
    Enterprise -- immediately.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have run into an unusual<br>
    situation here. There are people<br>
    on-board. Frozen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Frozen. How many?</p>
  <p>15 INT. DERELICT - THE SECOND ROOM (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> Data and Worf in the middle of the room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Three. What should I do? The<br>
    vehicle has suffered severe<br>
    damage. Most of the systems<br>
    have failed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you recommending they be<br>
    transferred to the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not think we should leave<br>
    them here. With your permission,<br>
    sir, we will be returning with<br>
    three containers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whatever you do, do it quickly.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Forge, set course zero-five-eight,<br>
    mark nine-seven-three.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye -- laying in the course now.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Captain, those coordinates will<br>

  <p> REACTIONS from the others to the destination.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's correct Mister La Forge, warp<br>
    factor eight.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Warp eight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage. Mister La Forge, you have<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM</p>
  <p> The regulars are at their positions, except Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Two Federation outposts in Sector<br>
    three-zero have been destroyed.<br>
    There has been no communication<br>
    with any Federation starbases in<br>
    Sector three-one since stardate<br>
    41903.2.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Romulans.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is the assumption.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's been no direct contact<br>
    with the Romulans since the Tomed<br>
    Incident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The question is: Why here? Why<br>
    now? What's their objective, if<br>
    indeed they have one? For half<br>
    a century there's barely a whisper<br>
    about them and now for no apparent<br>
    reason they seem to be back with<br>
    a roar. Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Almost everything we know about<br>
    them is based on rumor and<br>
    conjecture.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The strategic decision is to send<br>
    one ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is a risk. We could get<br>
    out there and find ourselves<br>
    greatly over-matched.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    True enough -- it is a gamble.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:<br>
    RIKER<br>
    This first encounter... coming<br>
    so suddenly after all this time.<br>
    There's a very good chance it's<br>
    a setup.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps the Romulans are probing.<br>
    They want to see how we react.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, we should expect<br>
    hostilities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prepare as always. If force is<br>
    needed we will use it, but that<br>
    will mean we have failed. Our<br>
    goal here is to establish some<br>
    kind of relations with the<br>
    Romulans -- failing that -- to<br>
    convince them of our resolve and<br>
    to do this without resorting to<br>
    force. Right now, the general<br>
    feeling is that they are seeking<br>
    a confrontation. They may want<br>
    to test themselves in battle<br>
    against a Federation starship to<br>
    gauge how much we have advanced.<br>
    Personally, I think it is<br>
    possible they have different<br>
    motives altogether based on needs<br>
    which we have not identified.<br>
    If that's the case... I must know<br>
    it.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor -- I will need a complete<br>
    profile on them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There is limited information, but<br>
    I will prepare something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data. Extrapolate for me the<br>
    logical progression of their<br>
    technical advancement;<br>
    specifically, but not restricted<br>
    to -- weapons.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to everybody)<br>
    I want this thought through<br>
    completely. Anticipate, as much<br>
    as you can, all the possible<br>
    permutations.</p>
  <p> He looks around the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Computer, how long before we<br>
    arrive at the Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Nineteen hours, twenty-eight<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will reassemble in six hours.<br>
    Let's be smart. No surprises.<br>
    I would much rather outthink them,<br>
    than outfight them. Questions?</p>
  <p> There are none. The meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As Picard, Riker and the others COME ON to the bridge.<br>
    Geordi is in the Command seat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (as he gets up)<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (then:)<br>
    Doctor Crusher said she would like<br>
    to talk with you, when you<br>
    finished your meeting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (on Com)<br>
    Doctor Crusher, this is the<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Oh, good. Captain, could you<br>
    possibly join me in Sickbay?</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/23/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I would not ask you if it wasn't<br>
    important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will be right there.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Take the Conn, Number One. I<br>
    won't be long.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS THE SHOT as Riker takes his position.</p>
  <p>21 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's the people from the capsule.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Capsule? People? What people?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The people Data beamed over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wasn't aware he had.</p>
  <p> On the medical tables behind her are THREE HUMANS<br>
    covered with sheets.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, he did and they were frozen.<br>
    I thawed them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I didn't know what else to do.<br>
    The crypts in which they had been<br>
    frozen were literally falling<br>
    apart. It was either that...<br>
    or...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's their condition?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/22/88 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Right now they are all sleeping.<br>
    Each of them needed minor medical<br>
    attention... minor &quot;now&quot;, but<br>
    &quot;then&quot; their conditions were<br>
    obviously terminal. One had a<br>
    heart problem, another had an<br>
    advanced case of emphysema and<br>
    extensive liver damage. But the<br>
    most surprising thing, is that<br>
    each of them had been frozen after<br>
    they died.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    After they died?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exactly. Cryonics. It was a<br>
    kind of fad in the late twentieth<br>
    century. People feared dying.<br>
    It terrified them. At the moment<br>
    of death, they would be frozen,<br>
    so that later... some time in the<br>
    future, when presumably medical<br>
    science had a cure for whatever<br>
    killed them, they would be thawed<br>
    back to life, healed and sent on<br>
    about their business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, for this group, apparently<br>
    it worked.</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS OVER to the com panel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data, please<br>
    report to Sickbay -- immediately.</p>
  <p>22 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is a Science Station Two. He looks up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Permission to leave the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Granted.</p>
  <p> Data walks toward the turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>23 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> ON Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am never critical of any member<br>
    of my staff being curious, but...<br>
    the timing is just so...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I could not leave them there,<br>
    Captain. The condition of the<br>
    vehicle was deteriorating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But, Data -- they were already<br>
    dead. I mean... what more could<br>
    have happened to them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I see your point, Captain, but<br>
    at the time...</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right -- under the<br>
    circumstances I would have done<br>
    exactly the same.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    When they arrived... what was I<br>
    supposed to do? Not help them?</p>
  <p> Again Picard has no answer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My question is: What do we do<br>
    with them now?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are the options?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We cannot go back and return them<br>
    to their ship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We can't refreeze them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/21/88 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They are alive now, so we have<br>
    to treat them as living human<br>
    beings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alive and well, just waiting to<br>
    be awakened.</p>
  <p> Picard is perplexed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have them sedated but they<br>
    should be up and about as soon<br>
    as possible.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a deep breath.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well...</p>
  <p> He looks around for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Then, there really is no choice.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    None that I can see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Before you wake them, I want<br>
    Security here.<br>
    (touching com)<br>
    Mister Worf, report to Sickbay.</p>
  <p>24 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> She goes to the first one in the line and touches the<br>
    hypospray to her neck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>25 WOMAN</p>
  <p> Slowly she wakes up. Looks around. At Sickbay. At<br>
    the equipment, then at Beverly and Picard. She<br>
    swallows. Worf ENTERS Sickbay. The woman takes one<br>
    look at them and her head falls back on the table. Out<br>
    &quot;cold&quot; again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... Welcome to the twenty-fourth<br>
    century.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>26 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at warp speed.</p>
  <p>27 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> It is as we left it. Picard, Data and Worf watch as<br>
    Beverly wakes them all up, we get to &quot;meet&quot; each of<br>
    the guests. They are still covered only in sheets.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was able to retrieve some<br>
    information from the ancient disk<br>
    I removed from the module's<br>
    computer. Based on that...</p>
  <p>28 NUMBER ONE</p>
  <p> She re-awakens the woman.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Her name is Clare Raymond, age<br>
    thirty-five; occupation,<br>
    homemaker... must be some kind<br>
    of construction work.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She died of an embolism. It<br>
    probably happened very suddenly,<br>
    otherwise her physical condition<br>
    was excellent.</p>
  <p> CLARE RAYMOND is handsome, not pretty. A solid,<br>
    no-nonsense person. This time she stays awake, as she<br>
    takes in the room, everything and everyone in it.<br>
    They move to:</p>
  <p>29 NUMBER TWO</p>
  <p> As the nurse (Nurse Wright) awakens him:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    His name is Ralph Offenhouse, age<br>
    sixty-three; occupation,<br>
    financier.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Advanced cardiomyopathy,<br>
    inoperable at the time, but easily<br>
    correctable now. He must have<br>
    known for some time his condition<br>
    was terminal.</p>
  <p> RALPH OFFENHOUSE was a power broker on both coasts<br>
    who came up hard -- is used to being absolutely in<br>
    charge. He too, is disoriented -- confused -- unsure.<br>
    They MOVE to the last:</p>
  <p>30 NUMBER THREE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Much of his file could not be<br>
    retrieved. His name is L. Q.<br>
    &quot;Sonny&quot; Clemonds. Apparently his<br>
    occupation had something to do<br>
    with music.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There was marked deterioration<br>
    of every system in his body.<br>
    Probably due to massive chemical<br>
    abuse. Unbelievable.</p>
  <p> L. Q. &quot;SONNY&quot; CLEMONDS has a lot of miles on his<br>
    forty-seven years. He's passed his time with booze<br>
    and drugs, and covered up the wear and tear with<br>
    cosmetic surgery. His attention span is about<br>
    twenty-eight seconds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That sounds like someone who hated<br>
    life -- yet he had himself frozen<br>
    so presumably he could go through<br>
    it all again.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Fear. Too afraid to live... too<br>
    scared to die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, this seems to be a<br>
    situation more suited to your<br>
    talents. I will leave it in your<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> With a nod to Data to join him:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll be on the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/21/88 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He is satisfied that they do not represent a clear and<br>
    present danger to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Picard and Data EXIT.</p>
  <p>A31 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> a flyby.</p>
  <p>31 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> The three humans are finishing dressing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know you have a lot of<br>
    questions, but I would like you<br>
    to wait. You are feeling a<br>
    certain amount of disorientation.<br>
    In a little while it should pass;<br>
    then we can fully discuss what<br>
    has happened. Nurse Wright will<br>
    furnish you with anything you<br>
    need.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Not so fast. Is this part of the<br>
    service or is it extra?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think it would be best if...</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I demand to know the cost of<br>
    anything you do before the<br>
    procedure is approved.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I have no idea what you're talking<br>
    about.<br>
    (then, mostly for the<br>
    others)<br>
    Just take it slowly. Everything<br>
    is fine. Worf, would you show<br>
    them to the guest quarters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p>32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER and CROSS to the Command<br>
    Position.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/18/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Number One, kindly take charge<br>
    of our guests until we have time<br>
    to decide what we are going to do<br>
    with them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... and keep them out of my way.</p>
  <p> Riker rises to leave.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (requesting to join<br>
    Riker)<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Picard nods as Data EXITS with Riker.</p>
  <p>33 INT. GUEST LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They are all sitting -- unsure of themselves.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know this is all very confusing<br>
    to you so I'll attempt to<br>
    explain. First -- you are on the<br>
    starship -- USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    American?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No -- we are a vessel of the United<br>
    Federation of Planets. Earth is<br>
    a member.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    What year is this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    By your calendar... two thousand<br>
    three hundred sixty-four.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    (very excited)<br>
    What?<br>
    (then, holding back)<br>
    My heart? Is it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's perfectly fine. In fact,<br>
    you are all now in excellent<br>
    health.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I made it... It worked. I never<br>
    believed this was...</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    (pointing to Data)<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An android.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    You mean a robot?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually there is a distinct<br>
    difference between a robot and<br>
    an android.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    And him? The one I saw before<br>
    with the... head.</p>
  <p> Riker is confused.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She means Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh, he's a Klingon, and that<br>
    requires a little more<br>
    explanation.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Guys... listen. I paid some idiot<br>
    a lot of money to freeze me when<br>
    I died. I need to hear the<br>
    words... Am I alive?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh, yes... absolutely.</p>

    And the liver that was about to<br>
    explode in my face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perfectly sound.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Great...</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    (who has remained<br>
    confused through it<br>
    all)<br>
    Excuse me. Would someone tell<br>
    me what's going on?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... About three hundred and<br>
    seventy years ago you died of a<br>
    massive embolism.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    I don't remember anything about<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You and the others were frozen.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Cryonics -- you know... freeze you<br>
    now... heal you later.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    I've heard about it; I just never<br>
    paid it much mind. How did we<br>
    get here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why were you in a module?</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    The whacko who sold me this scam<br>
    said that by putting us in orbit<br>
    there would be no chance of brown<br>
    out.</p>

  <p> RALPH<br>
    Several cryonics companies had<br>
    fallen into disrepute because of<br>
    power failures which adversely<br>
    affected their refrigeration<br>
    system. Their stocks were<br>
    severely depressed.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    The whole deal was a long shot...<br>
    but I figured... what the hell,<br>
    might as well give them the dough<br>
    instead of leaving it to my<br>
    ex-wives.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    But you know, son, I figured it<br>
    was just so much hooey.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hooey? Accessing.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Ah, as in malarkey... jive...<br>
    bull... hogwash... an<br>
    intentional fabrication.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    There you go, now you got it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Clare)<br>
    If you didn't contract for this,<br>
    who did?</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    It must have been Donald -- my<br>
    husband. If it was new and<br>
    foolish, he'd have popped for it.<br>
    Well, I'll say this. It's the<br>
    first thing he ever bought into<br>
    that worked.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I, for one, never had a doubt.<br>
    My stock in this company must have<br>
    split a dozen times by now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually the process of cryonics<br>
    was never more than a fad, and<br>
    did not continue much beyond the<br>
    mid-twenty-first century.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I need to make a phone call as<br>
    soon as possible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A phone call?</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I have provided for myself. I<br>
    have a substantial portfolio.<br>
    It's critical I check on it. Let<br>
    the bank know that I am alive and<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's ah... going to be a little<br>
    difficult right at the moment.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Do you at least have a copy of The<br>
    Wall Street Journal?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we should take the<br>
    doctor's advice and go slowly.<br>
    Get adjusted to your new... ah...<br>
    whatever, and then we'll talk to<br>
    the captain.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    They seem to be creatures of<br>
    extremes. One moment violent<br>
    beyond description, the next --<br>
    tender. They're related to the<br>
    Vulcans but as each developed,<br>
    their differences grew wider.<br>
    They are intensely curious. Their<br>
    belief in their own superiority<br>
    is beyond arrogance. For some<br>
    reason they have exhibited a<br>
    fascination with humans and that<br>
    fascination, more than anything<br>
    else, has kept the peace. One<br>
    other thing, they will not<br>
    initiate. They will wait for<br>
    you to commit yourself.</p>

    not that structured.</p>
  <p> Sonny walks over to the computer.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Now what?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Talk.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    I'd like me a thick Kansas City<br>
    steak - country fried potatoes<br>
    -- a mess of greens -- and... Oh,<br>
    hell... forget all of that. Let<br>
    me have a martini - -straight up...<br>
    two olives.<br>
    (he winks at Data)<br>
    ... for the vitamins.</p>
  <p> The drink is provided. He takes a sip and rears back<br>
    surprised.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there something wrong?</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Wrong? Only that your computer<br>
    here fixed just about the best<br>
    martini I have ever had.<br>
    (with a nod to Data)<br>
    I just might get to like this<br>
    place. Let's see if the Braves<br>
    are on. How do you turn on this<br>
    here teevee?</p>

    Teevee?</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Yeah, boob-tube... you know. I'd<br>
    like to find out how the Braves<br>
    are doin' after all this time.<br>
    Probably still finding ways to<br>
    lose.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Oh -- I think he means television,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Or maybe catch up on the soaps.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Sonny)<br>
    That particular form of entertainment<br>
    did not last much beyond the year<br>
    Two Thousand Forty.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    So, what do you guys do? I mean,<br>
    you don't drink -- no teevee -- kind<br>
    of boring, isn't it?</p>
  <p> Data is at a loss of words</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    On the way.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    With whom were you speaking?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The captain.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Ah... good. Tell him I would like<br>
    to see him as soon as it's<br>
    convenient.</p>

  <p> Riker does not have an immediate answer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That will be up to the captain.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Well, get him in here. I have<br>
    to phone Geneva right away about<br>
    my accounts. The interest alone<br>
    could be enough to buy even this<br>

    These are not like any other<br>

    I find them fascinating.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From what I have already seen<br>
    of our &quot;guests&quot;, there is very<br>
    little to redeem them. In fact,<br>
    it makes me wonder, how our<br>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>35 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> The staff meeting is reassembled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are six hours from the Neutral<br>
    Zone. I have been unable to<br>
    establish communications with any<br>
    Federation colony or station in<br>
    this vicinity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How many outposts are there in<br>
    this sector?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we should go on the<br>
    presumption that they've all<br>
    been destroyed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    By the Romulans?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It fits their historical pattern.</p>
  <p> Picard is very thoughtful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since there has been no contact<br>
    with the Romulans for fifty-three<br>
    years, seven months, eighteen<br>
    days, we must consider that the<br>
    information we do have, is out<br>
    of date.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/22/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The positive side of that is their<br>
    information about us is also out<br>
    of date. Captain, I believe that<br>
    lack of information is what this<br>
    is all about.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Continue, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In my opinion, the Romulans want<br>
    a confrontation... specifically<br>
    against us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not by name; but yes, against us.<br>
    They know the Federation will send<br>
    their best -- this will be a<br>
    perfect chance for them to learn<br>
    firsthand, how much we have<br>
    advanced in both technology, and<br>
    technique.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And your recommendation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know if I have a specific<br>
    recommendation. Perhaps we should<br>
    consider taking the initiative.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I agree with Commander Riker.<br>
    We may only have one opportunity;<br>
    we should seize it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That strategy is built on a single<br>
    premise. The hostile intent of<br>
    the Romulans. If the premise is<br>
    sound, so is the proposal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If their intention isn't hostile,<br>
    what is it?</p>
  <p> RALPH'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Surprised at the interruption.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the captain, to whom am<br>
    I speaking?</p>
  <p> RALPH'S COM VOICE<br>
    Ralph Offenhouse. Captain, I need<br>
    to talk to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's going on here, Number One?<br>
    Did you give him permission to<br>
    contact me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir. He must have seen me<br>
    use the com panel.</p>
  <p> Picard nods his understanding.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Listen, Mister Offenhouse. We<br>
    are in a very important conference<br>
    right now and...</p>
  <p> RALPH'S COM VOICE<br>
    I am sick and tired of being put<br>
    off by you and your staff. This<br>
    is the worst run ship I have ever<br>
    been on. You could take some<br>
    lessons from the Q-E Two. Now<br>
    that's an efficient operation.</p>
  <p> Picard mutes the intercom.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data -- identify -- what's the<br>
    Q-E-Two?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was a passenger liner which<br>
    mostly traveled Earth's Atlantic<br>
    Ocean during the late twentieth<br>
    and early twenty-first centuries.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's comparing the Enterprise to<br>
    a cruise ship.</p>
  <p> RALPH'S COM VOICE<br>
    I demand you see me.</p>
  <p> Picard is nonplussed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>36 INT. GUEST LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Ralph by the com panel, still going on. The other two,<br>
    Clare and Sonny are off to one side, watching. Sonny<br>
    is slightly amused -- Clare still appears to be<br>
    disoriented.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    ... I think I have been very, very<br>
    patient, especially under the<br>
    circumstances and considering what<br>
    I paid for this procedure, but<br>
    frankly enough is enough. I<br>
    demand a phone, or a radio<br>
    whatever you have. I must contact<br>
    my...</p>
  <p> The doors OPEN and Picard STRIDES IN.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    (continuing; off balance<br>
    for a beat)<br>
    ...lawyers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Ralph composes himself quickly.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> He steps forward with his hand out.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now, we'll be able to get some<br>
    things straight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed we will. Those com panels<br>
    are for official ship business.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    If they are so important, why<br>
    don't they need an &quot;executive<br>
    key&quot;?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Aboard a starship, that is not<br>
    necessary. We are all capable<br>
    of exercising self-control. You<br>
    will refrain from using them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/24/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Now just a minute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are involved in a<br>
    very serious and potentially<br>
    dangerous situation.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I'm sure that whatever it is seems<br>
    very important to you. My<br>
    situation is far more critical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do not think you are fully aware<br>
    of your situation, or the time<br>
    which has passed.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Believe me, I'm fully cognizant<br>
    of where I am, and when. It is<br>
    simply that I have more to protect<br>
    than a man in your position could<br>
    possibly imagine. No offense,<br>
    but a military career has never<br>
    been considered upwardly mobile.<br>
    I must contact my lawyer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your lawyer has been dead for<br>
    centuries.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Yes, of course I know that, but<br>
    he was a full partner with a very<br>
    important firm. Rest assured the<br>
    firm is still operating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what this is all about...<br>
    A lot has changed in three hundred<br>
    years. People are no longer<br>
    obsessed with the accumulation of<br>
    &quot;things&quot;. We have eliminated hunger,<br>
    want, the need for possessions.<br>
    We have grown out of our infancy.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    You've got it wrong. It's never<br>
    been about &quot;possessions&quot; - it's<br>
    about power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; - 3/17/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Power to do what?</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    To control your life, your<br>
    destiny.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That kind of control is an<br>
    illusion.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Really -- I'm here aren't I? I<br>
    should be dead and I'm not.<br>
    That's what money did for me.<br>
    That's the kind of power I'm<br>
    talking about.</p>
  <p> Off to the side, Clare begins softly weeping.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (turning to her)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    I don't know. It just started<br>
    and I can't stop. I keep<br>

  <p> RALPH<br>
    Captain. I didn't mean to come<br>
    on so strong. I've built my life<br>
    on knowing what's going on. For<br>
    the first time -- I'm completely<br>
    out of touch -- it makes me crazy.<br>
    Can you understand?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's the first thing you've said<br>
    that I do understand. I'll see<br>
    what I can do. But please... stay<br>

    he'd mess up a free lunch. Why<br>

    He must have thought you would<br>
    have wanted it.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    I can tell you exactly what<br>
    happened. He couldn't think about<br>
    going on alone. I died, but he<br>
    couldn't face it. So he figured<br>
    if he had me frozen, then in his<br>
    mind I wasn't really gone. Crazy,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I strongly recommend that<br>
    we go to Red Alert. If the<br>
    Romulans have improved their<br>
    cloaking device, and we'd be fools<br>
    to think they haven't, we should<br>
    assume a more defensive posture.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I agree, Captain. I recommend<br>
    we go immediately to battle<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> Picard will not be pushed.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    If not &quot;battle stations,&quot; may I<br>
    at least bring the ship to Yellow<br>

  <p> Picard considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Number One. That would be<br>

    I've spent my career being able<br>
    to tell when the other guy's mouth<br>
    is dry. There is something going<br>
    on. Something serious. The<br>

  <p> SONNY<br>
    He called it a pattern replication.<br>
    It plays real good, too.</p>
  <p> And he hits a couple of chords.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I'm trying to tell you that there<br>
    is a situation developing on this<br>

    you can talk about is that stupid<br>
    guitar!</p>

  <p> RALPH<br>
    That may be all right for you,<br>
    but I am not willing to allow my<br>
    fate to be decided by others.<br>

  <p> Ralph gives Sonny a look and goes to the door. It<br>
    OPENS. There is a security guard standing there.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    He needs help. I think he's<br>
    dying.</p>
  <p> As the security guard ENTERS the room and MOVES toward<br>
    Sonny, Ralph SLIPS UP behind him and hits him on the<br>
    head, knocking him unconscious.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    What the hell are you doing?</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    I'm going to find out what's going<br>
    on.</p>

    quickly about their business. Ralph is able to move<br>
    along unnoticed.</p>
  <p>A48 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Ralph continues moving forward, he notices the<br>
    turbolift door OPEN and some Enterprise personnel EXIT.<br>
    He STEPS ONTO the turbolift. For a moment he is<br>
    confused; he knows it's an elevator, but he sees no<br>
    buttons. He looks around, then to himself:</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Ah... let's see.<br>

    Ah... I want to go to a... the...<br>
    ah...<br>

    Captain, my sensors indicate a<br>

    on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I recommend we transfer<br>
    all power to phasers, and arm the<br>
    photon torpedos.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wait. If that is a Romulan ship,<br>
    it will read our intent. We will<br>
    be forcing them to take a similar<br>
    posture. We are not out here to<br>
    engage in battles; we are explorers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, there is sufficient<br>
    evidence. Outposts have been<br>
    destroyed... Countless lives have<br>

    said it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stay calm, everyone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, these are Romulans -- they<br>
    are without honor. They killed<br>
    my parents in an attack on<br>
    Khitomer at a time when they were<br>
    supposed to be our allies. They<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but correct in his<br>
    assessment.</p>
  <p> TEBOK<br>
    We do not know who is<br>
    responsible... Why entire<br>

  <p> TEBOK<br>
    Captain Picard, because your<br>
    actions are those of a thoughtful<br>
    man who is neither rash nor easily<br>
    provoked, I tell you this. More<br>
    urgent matters have caused our<br>
    absence, and witness the results.<br>
    Outposts destroyed, evidence of<br>
    the Federation everywhere. We<br>
    have been negligent, but no more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have made some progress in our<br>
    relations... let's not ruin that<br>

  <p>56B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The READOUT on the screen indicates that Thomas Raymond<br>
    is married and has two children, ages four and seven.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Computer -- let us see Thomas<br>
    Raymond.</p>
  <p> And the screen REPAINTS with a semi-line drawing of<br>
    a man around thirty.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    Oh, my God... It's Donald...<br>
    that's my husband.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually, it's your great, great,<br>
    great, great, great grandson.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    He's the spitting image.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have his address. When you get<br>
    back to Earth, you could go and<br>
    see him.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    But... I will still be out of<br>
    time. A relic.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps. But it's a place to<br>
    start. He is after all, family.</p>
  <p> Clare looks at the picture on the Screen.</p>
  <p> CLARE<br>
    There's no denying that.</p>
  <p> For the first time since she was thawed, her attitude<br>
    brightens.</p>
  <p>57 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard and other members of the crew are with the<br>
    &quot;guests.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Here is what I propose. You can't<br>
    remain on the Enterprise. We have<br>
    arranged to rendezvous with the<br>
    USS Charleston, bound for Earth.<br>
    You will be delivered there.</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    And then what will happen to us?<br>
    There's no trace of my money -- my<br>
    office is gone -- what will I do?<br>
    How will I live?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (amused)<br>
    This is the twenty-fourth century.<br>
    Those material needs no longer<br>
    exist.</p>
  <p> RALPH<br>
    Then what's the challenge?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To improve yourself... enrich<br>
    yourself. Enjoy it, Mister Offenhouse.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    Well, one good thing -- since<br>
    everybody's forgotten everything<br>
    I ever did... it'll all be brand<br>
    spankin' new. Hell, I'll be a<br>
    bigger hit than I ever was.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps so, anything is possible.</p>
  <p> SONNY<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    What say, son -- you'd make a hell<br>
    of a sideman.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That offer does present a certain<br>
    fascination.</p>
  <p>58 OMITTED</p>
  <p>59 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker EXIT from the turbolift.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have plotted a course to<br>
    intercept the Charleston, sir,<br>
    but they have informed me that<br>
    they will be making an extended<br>
    stop at Arloff Nine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;... Neutral... &quot; - REV. 3/22/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your point, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At warp eight, we could have<br>
    our guests at Starbase Thirty-Nine<br>
    Sierra in five days. It<br>
    would cut months off their<br>
    journey.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They will benefit from the<br>
    extended time. It will allow<br>
    them to acclimate before arriving<br>
    at Earth.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a pity we can't take them<br>
    ourselves. Having them on board<br>
    has been like a visit from the<br>
    past.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That would take us in the wrong<br>
    direction. Our mission is to go<br>
    forward and it has just begun.<br>
    Set velocity at warp six, Mister<br>
    La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir... warp six.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is still much to do... and<br>
    still so much to learn.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Mister La Forge... Engage.</p>
  <p>60 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it heads off.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
