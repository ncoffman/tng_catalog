    &quot;Angel One&quot; </p>
  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP AND PLANET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise APPROACHES, bearing down as:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41636.9.<br>
    As feared, our examination of the<br>
    seven year overdue Federation<br>
    freighter, Odin -- disabled by<br>
    an asteroid collision -- revealed<br>
    no survivors.</p>
  <p>2 REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> to show the Enterprise APPROACHING a GREEN PLANET. As<br>
    the Enterprise slows to assume an orbit:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    However, three escape pods were<br>
    missing, suggesting the<br>
    possibility of survivors...</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENTERPRISE MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Green Planet is featured on the Main Viewer.<br>
    PICARD, GEORDI, DATA, RIKER, TASHA and TROI at their<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ready to begin orbit of Angel One,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Mister La Forge. What<br>
    kind of place is this, Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Angel One is a class M planet,<br>
    supporting carbon-based flora and<br>
    fauna, sparsely populated with<br>
    intelligent life forms... similar<br>
    in technological development to<br>
    mid-twentieth-century Earth.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just like being marooned at home.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Assuming any survivors made it<br>
    this far. Admittedly, it's the<br>
    closest planet to the Odin. But<br>
    the distance we've traveled in the<br>
    past two days at warp one would've<br>
    taken the Odin escape pods five<br>
    months.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Five months, fourteen days, eleven<br>
    hours, two minutes --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- and fifty-seven seconds.</p>
  <p> During this, Tasha reacts to a display at her station.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, we're receiving an audio<br>
    signal from Angel One.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet was quite adamant that<br>
    we maintain excellent diplomatic<br>
    relations with this planet. Any<br>
    other pertinent information before<br>
    we reply, Mister Data? Their form<br>
    of government would be a logical<br>
    starting place.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Angel One has evolved into a<br>
    constitutional oligarchy. It is<br>
    governed by a parliamentary body<br>
    consisting of six elected<br>
    Mistresses, and headed by a female<br>
    they refer to as &quot;The Elected<br>
    One.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It sounds very much like my own<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (aside to Data)<br>
    Klingons appreciate strong women.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How current is your information,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A Federation vessel last visited<br>
    this planet sixty-two years ago,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Except, let us hope, for the Odin<br>
    escape pods.<br>
    (then:)<br>
    Since this is a female-dominated<br>
    society, it might be more prudent<br>
    if you made the initial contact,<br>
    Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods, and:)<br>
    Please open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is Counselor Deanna Troi of<br>
    the USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> FEMALE'S COM VOICE<br>
    I am Beata, The Elected One. How<br>
    may we assist you, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The Federation has neglected a<br>
    visit to your planet for far too<br>
    long. With your permission, we<br>
    would like to correct that<br>
    oversight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We feel in no way neglected,<br>
    Counselor. A diplomatic courtesy<br>
    call is neither expected nor<br>
    required.</p>
  <p> REACTIONS at lack of hospitality. Troi pushes on:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We also come in search of possible<br>
    survivors from one of our<br>
    freighters.</p>
  <p> BEATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    A brief visit will be tolerated.</p>
  <p> CLICK.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    They've broken off transmission.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ever feel like you're not really<br>
    wanted?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's their prerogative,<br>
    Lieutenant.<br>
    (then:)<br>
    Prepare the away team, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, aye, sir.</p>
  <p> As Riker, Data, Troi and Tasha stand down, heading<br>
    toward the turbolift, Picard returns his attention to<br>
    the green planet on his Main Viewer.</p>
  <p>4 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> WESLEY and a BUDDY converge on the Holodeck entrance.<br>
    As WE FOLLOW this excited twosome, WE PICK UP Riker<br>
    (carrying a METALLIC BOX) Troi, Data and Tasha<br>
    APPROACHING from the opposite direction.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where're you boys off to?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Skiing, sir. Our instructor has<br>
    us scheduled for the Swiss Alps,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Save us some deep powder.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No problem, sir. The Holodeck<br>
    has all you'll ever need.</p>
  <p> All enjoy the enthusiasm of the boys as they HURRY INTO<br>
    the Holodeck.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and a transporter operator at the console as the<br>
    away team ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The away team is ready, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Angel One's position in this<br>
    quadrant may become strategically<br>
    vital. The hope at Starfleet is<br>
    that some day this planet could<br>
    become a part of the Federation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll try to make a good impression,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Tasha and Data take their places on the<br>
    Transporter pad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize!</p>
  <p> The operator does. TRANSPORTER EFFECT. Then:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. ANGEL ONE - DAY - ESTABLISH (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lush vegetation surrounded by high-tech architecture.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>7 INT. ANGEL ONE EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY</p>
  <p> Steel and glass and concrete, with all the trappings<br>
    of a Presidential Suite. The Elected One, BEATA, sits<br>
    behind a huge desk. Dressed in utilitarian fashion,<br>
    the woman is still very attractive. Hovering over her<br>
    is TRENT, her personal secretary. He's shorter in<br>
    stature, much more frail than Beata (as are all the<br>
    men of this planet). In contrast to his boss, he's<br>
    dressed in bright colors. Beata is busy scanning and<br>
    signing papers that Trent places in front of her, when:</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE - THE DOOR</p>
  <p> Another male secretary shows Troi, Data, Tasha and<br>
    Riker INTO the office, then WITHDRAWS. They stand<br>
    before the desk, waiting.</p>
  <p>9 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Beata lets our away team &quot;learn their place&quot; as she<br>
    continues to ignore them, studying documents, etc.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    See that these matters are handled<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    As you wish, Mistress.</p>
  <p> He takes the papers, HURRIES OUT. Finally, Beata<br>
    focuses on the away team.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    I am Beata, The Elected One of<br>
    Angel One.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mistress Beata, I am Counselor<br>
    Troi.<br>
    (refers to metal box)<br>
    We've brought you a small token<br>
    of our goodwill.</p>
  <p> Beata eyes the metal box... eyes Riker.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    My cooperation is not for sale,<br>
    Counselor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We didn't mean to imply that it<br>
    was, Mistress.<br>
    (beat, and:)<br>
    Out of respect to your wishes that<br>
    we keep our visit brief, perhaps<br>
    you would like to address the<br>
    issue of survivors immediately.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (curtly)<br>
    Immediately -- but not<br>
    impetuously. You will present<br>
    your case.</p>
  <p> She rises. This woman is as tall as Riker.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Until I am certain of your<br>
    intentions, I know of no such<br>
    survivors.</p>
  <p> And on this unexpected twist, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. ANGEL ONE - DAY - ESTABLISH (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p>11 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> Steel, glass and smooth concrete softened by dripping<br>
    ferns and draped sheers. The outer doors swing open<br>
    and IN STRIDES our away team. Riker still carries the<br>
    metal box.</p>
  <p>12 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> TO REVEAL the occupants. A large U-shaped table<br>
    dominates the room. At the top of the U is Beata.<br>
    Trent stands behind off one shoulder. The flanking<br>
    sides of the table are occupied by three (tall) WOMEN<br>
    to each side, one of whom will be identified as ARIEL.<br>
    Several other male secretaries are in attendance along<br>
    the perimeter of the table.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Representatives of the Starship<br>
    Enterprise -- do you wish to<br>
    petition the Parliament of Angel<br>
    One?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We do. We have reason to hope<br>
    that survivors from a damaged<br>
    Federation freighter may be<br>
    marooned on your planet. We are<br>
    seeking to learn if this is so.</p>
  <p> General stoicism from the Parliamentarians. Except<br>
    for Ariel who displays particular interest.<br>
    Suspiciously:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Even a planet as remote as Angel<br>
    One has heard of Starfleet.<br>
    Searching the galaxy for survivors<br>
    seems a petty task for one of their<br>
    mighty vessels.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't consider even one<br>
    survivor petty.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (to Troi, offended)<br>
    Is this man suggesting that we<br>
    place a lesser value on life than<br>
    you do?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not at all.</p>
  <p> Troi looks to Riker for encouragement. He nods for<br>
    her to continue.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our discovery of the abandoned<br>
    freighter was an accident,<br>
    Mistress Beata. We have a duty<br>
    to investigate.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    I see. And if you were to find<br>
    survivors? What then?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We will take them with us. See<br>
    that they are reunited with their<br>
    families.</p>
  <p> Ariel reacts to this, her concern evident.</p>
  <p> ARIEL<br>
    Mistress Beata... ?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Yes, Ariel?</p>
  <p> ARIEL<br>
    Are we to take these strangers<br>
    at their word?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    A good question.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What reason could we possibly have<br>
    to deceive you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Another good question.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are there survivors from the<br>
    freighter Odin on this planet?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    After we discuss that matter,<br>
    we'll let you know.</p>
  <p> What the hell kind of answer is that? Before it can<br>
    be pursued:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing; to Trent)<br>
    See to their comforts.</p>
  <p> Trent leaves his place near the seat of power to escort<br>
    the away team from the Great Hall.</p>
  <p>13 INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY</p>
  <p> As plush as the Great Hall, consisting of common area<br>
    with doors leading to separate sleeping cubicles. The<br>
    main door OPENS -- Trent LEADS the away team IN.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    You will remain here until<br>
    summoned.</p>
  <p> Trent EXITS. Tasha removes a tricorder, checks the<br>
    area. As Riker places the metal box on a side table:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are we able to talk? Is the<br>
    area secure?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yes. Tricorder doesn't show<br>
    any listening devices or<br>
    anything else of a threatening<br>
    nature</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good. Troi?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There was much fear in that room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Paranoia, if you ask me. But of<br>
    what?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I cannot say. Nor do I feel their<br>
    fear was focused. I sensed that<br>
    all were not concerned for the<br>
    same reason.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are undoubtedly survivors<br>
    from the Odin on this planet,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I agree. Otherwise, why would<br>
    they be so circumspect?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    As the Mistress Beata is so fond<br>
    of saying -- good question.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do we do if they elect to<br>
    deny the existence of any<br>
    survivors?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's not look for problems.</p>
  <p> But of course, that's what they are all trained to do.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship continues to orbit Angel One.</p>
  <p>15 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR NEAR HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Picard and WORF are walking down the hallway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want all departments prepared<br>
    for a warp six trip to the Neutral<br>
    Zone as soon as the away team<br>
    completes its mission.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Trouble, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Insurance. Romulan battlecruisers<br>
    have been detected near one of<br>
    our border posts. They've<br>
    requested assistance as soon as<br>
    we are available.</p>
  <p> Without warning, Picard is hit squarely on the cheek by<br>
    a SNOWBALL. He stops cold.</p>
  <p>16 REVERSE - OPEN HOLODECK DOOR</p>
  <p> A laughing Wesley comes TUMBLING OUT, smashing into<br>
    Worf as he avoids the pursuit of his buddy. Both skid<br>
    to a shocked halt at sight of Picard.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain Picard!</p>
  <p> Picard wipes the snow from his face. The boys, soaking<br>
    wet themselves, cringe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We, ah, finished our ski lesson,<br>
    sir... and it kinda just happened,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the Enterprise, Mister Crusher,<br>
    nothing &quot;just happens.&quot;<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    What is that smell?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (sniffs, and:)<br>
    Hmm, yes... slightly reminiscent<br>
    of Night-Blooming Throgni,<br>
    Captain. From home.<br>
    (deep breath)<br>
    Quite stimulating, wouldn't you<br>
    say?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Wesley tries to smell, but no luck. He glances at his<br>
    Buddy who shrugs.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I can't smell anything. I'm<br>
    a little congested...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't let this &quot;just happen&quot;<br>
    again, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (snapping to)<br>
    Yes, sir!!</p>
  <p> As the boys wheel and MARCH/RUN OFF, Worf catches<br>
    Picard with the hint of a smile. Shaking it off, the<br>
    two men continue on.</p>
  <p>17 INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY</p>
  <p> Tasha pacing; Troi and Riker sitting; Data examining<br>
    knickknacks. Data's attention falls on an atomizer.<br>
    Squeezing the ball, he gets a face full of mist. Sniffs:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interesting. An alcohol-based<br>
    synthetic, artificially<br>
    reproducing a floral scent.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is called perfume, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The purpose of which is... ?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Certain cultures consider perfume<br>
    an aphrodisiac.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am unfamiliar with that term.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An aphrodisiac is something<br>
    designed to stimulate or enhance<br>
    sexual pleasure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How does stimulation of the<br>
    olfactory nerve affect the<br>
    enjoyment of sex?</p>
  <p> All look to the other to field this one. They are<br>
    saved by the door. Trent ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    The Elected One will see you now.</p>
  <p> He stands aside so that Riker, Tasha and Troi can EXIT.<br>
    Data brings up the rear, putting the atomizer down as<br>
    he EXITS. Trent picks up the atomizer, sprays himself,<br>
    enjoys the scent a moment before FOLLOWING.</p>
  <p>18 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Beata.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    You claim you intend to remove<br>
    these survivors from our planet.<br>
    Are you prepared to give us your<br>
    solemn word on that?</p>
  <p>19 REVERSE ON OUR AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> standing as before.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We are.</p>
  <p>20 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Parliament in full session as before.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    You should know that the vote was<br>
    not unanimous. Some among us are<br>
    suspicious.</p>
  <p>21 ARIEL</p>
  <p> to name one.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>22 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Yet, the majority feel that we<br>
    have no choice but to trust you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't understand the source<br>
    of your misgivings, Mistress, but<br>
    we appreciate your faith in us.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    Make certain that our faith has<br>
    not been misplaced.<br>
    (then:)<br>
    There are four survivors from the<br>
    ship you call the Odin. All male.<br>
    Their leader is a man who calls<br>
    himself Ramsey.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll bring these men to us,<br>
    we'll have them off your planet<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    If they were mine to deliver, I<br>
    would do so without hesitation.<br>
    Unfortunately, their hiding place<br>
    has long eluded us.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hiding place? Why are they in<br>
    hiding?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Because they are fugitives on<br>
    Angel One! And the sooner we are<br>
    rid of them, the better!<br>
    (calming down)<br>
    When these men arrived seven years<br>
    ago, they accepted our hospitality<br>
    quickly enough. But gradually,<br>
    they grew restive. Making<br>
    unreasonable demands, going<br>
    against the natural order -- there<br>
    seemed to be no end to the trouble<br>
    they created.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Using the technology of the<br>
    Enterprise, we might be able to<br>
    find these men.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT ONE 16.</p>

  <p> BEATA<br>
    I assumed as much. But be warned,<br>
    Counselor --<br>
    (beat, and:)<br>
    -- these men are dangerous.</p>
  <p> Our away team members exchange a look -- what have they<br>
    stepped in this time? And on this, we:</p>

  <p> BEVERLY administers hypo shots to Wesley's buddy who<br>
    is laid out on a bed next to Wesley as:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (suffering)<br>
    This is worse than Hesperan<br>
    Thumping Cough. What is it, Mom?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You and your friend probably<br>
    picked up something on the Quazulu<br>
    Eight field trip last week.<br>
    Whatever it is may have been<br>
    activated by your exposure to the<br>
    cold ski environment of the<br>
    Holodeck.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But the transporter biofilter is<br>
    supposed to kill stuff like that.</p>
  <p> Beverly has moved to stand at his side, checking his<br>
    vital signs with an instrument.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If this is our first contact, it<br>
    wouldn't have been programmed into<br>
    the biofilter computer yet.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (getting sleepy)<br>
    Mom...</p>
  <p> And he's asleep. Beverly gives in to the out-dated,<br>
    yet motherly hand-to-Wesley's-forehead-checking-for-fever,<br>
    tucks him in. FOLLOW AS she CROSSES to her LAB<br>
    AREA. The work space already shows the CLUTTER of her<br>
    search for answers to this illness.</p>

    Picard here.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wesley and one of his friends have<br>
    contracted some form of<br>
    respiratory ailment -- most likely<br>
    a viral infection.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it contained?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I believe so. I've isolated the<br>
    twelve students who were on the<br>
    field trip where I believe the<br>
    problem began.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How contagious is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Unknown. Nor do I have a clue<br>
    as to how it's transmitted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please stay with it, Doctor.<br>
    Starfleet has important business<br>
    for us as soon as the away team<br>
    returns. I don't relish having my<br>
    crew infected.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    At the moment, my only suggestion<br>
    is that all crew avoid any<br>
    cold-weather Holodeck simulations<br>
    until further notice.</p>
  <p> Picard rubs his neck, trying to ease the stiffness.<br>
    His voice betrays a trace of irritation:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT TWO 19.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. And keep me advised.</p>
  <p> Damn that stiffness!</p>

  <p> Away team present. Beata and her Parliamentarians<br>
    listen as:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, how can we best go about<br>
    finding Mister Ramsey and the<br>
    other survivors?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Assuming the survivors have<br>
    retained some remnants of their<br>
    lives aboard the Odin, we might<br>
    not have a difficult task. If<br>
    we can isolate something unique<br>
    to the survivors -- perhaps an<br>
    element not otherwise found on<br>
    Angel One -- we can utilize the<br>
    Enterprise scanners.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beata)<br>
    Mister Data will need access to<br>
    your library.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Our library is far too<br>
    sophisticated for a man to<br>
    comprehend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am an android, Mistress, though<br>
    anatomically, I am a fully<br>
    functioning male.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    An amusing notion. Perhaps you<br>
    could teach our males a thing or<br>
    two.<br>
    (with a look)<br>
    Trent -- see to the android's<br>
    needs.</p>
  <p> Trent nods, LEADS Data from the room. To the team:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Do not forget your promise.</p>
  <p> Without another word, Beata, and then the other women,<br>

  <p>30 INT. ENTERPRISE - CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Beverly hovers over Picard with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is all quite unnecessary,<br>
    Doctor.<br>
    (suppressing the pain)<br>
    I'm merely fatigued.</p>
  <p> Beverly reads the tricorder, shakes her head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Because you are very ill, Captain.<br>
    You have the virus.<br>
    (in full stature)<br>
    Captain, in my opinion, you are<br>
    no longer physically able to<br>
    effectively command this vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't be ridiculous, Doctor. I've<br>
    got an away team down there, in<br>
    less-than-friendly territory, not<br>
    to mention an appointment with the<br>
    several Romulan battlecruisers...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have an appointment in your<br>
    cabin, Captain. With your bed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that an order?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She's as stern as she can be. He relents.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I guess I'm better at giving<br>
    orders than taking them.</p>
  <p> She smiles. He shivers.</p>
  <p>31 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf at their stations.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stuffy nose)<br>
    I think I may sneeze...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A Klingon sneeze?!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Only kind I know.</p>
  <p> Geordi's dread is short-lived as Picard, walking<br>
    unsteadily, ENTERS the bridge, FOLLOWED by Beverly.<br>
    Every eye sneaks a look. Pausing at the turbolift,<br>
    he turns to Geordi:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge -- you have<br>
    command until further notice.<br>
    Please make the proper entries<br>
    in the ship's log.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly ENTER the turbolift; doors CLOSE.<br>
    Geordi's concern for Picard is tempered by the supreme<br>
    pleasure he feels as he experiments with the fit of<br>
    the command chair. Worf glances at his scanner<br>
    display:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Scanners indicate a platinum<br>
    trace. Should I notify the away<br>
    team?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Worf stares and shakes his head in reaction. Even<br>
    Geordi can't believe he said that. The command chair<br>
    seems to fit Geordi like a glove.</p>
  <p>32 INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Riker, Trent with him as escort, stands before Beata<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Enterprise reports a possible<br>
    location for Mister Ramsey and<br>
    the other survivors.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    So soon? I'm impressed with your<br>

  <p> ARIEL<br>
    I am suspicious of it.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    You've had your opportunity to<br>
    object, Ariel. You were in the<br>
    minority.</p>
  <p> ARIEL<br>
    Excuse me, Mistress. I have<br>
    matters to attend to elsewhere.</p>
  <p> Giving the away team a final look, she EXITS. And:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With your permission, we'd like<br>
    to begin our search immediately.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    By all means.<br>
    (rising)<br>
    But I'm sure that Counselor Troi<br>
    and the others can do that without<br>
    you.<br>
    (off his reaction)<br>
    If I recall, you had a gesture<br>
    of goodwill you wished to give<br>
    me... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That can certainly wait until<br>
    we've recovered the survivors.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Are you suggesting that the women<br>
    in your party are incapable of<br>
    performing this task without the<br>
    help of a man?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all. Lieutenant Yar and<br>

    there are other people to do that<br>
    job now.</p>
  <p> Geordi sees the wisdom of this, presses the Com:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    bridge to Engineering. Lieutenant<br>
    Wong knows the system. I'm sure<br>
    she'll be able to resolve all<br>
    problems.</p>
  <p> ENGINEERING'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'll ask her to look at it right<br>
    away, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Stopping in the Lift, Worf turns back to face Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thanks for the advice.</p>
  <p> Worf nods. But he can't speak because another sneeze<br>
    is on the way. The turbolift doors CLOSE just in time<br>
    as the SNEEZE explodes.</p>
  <p>41 INT. ANGEL ONE HIDEOUT - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Ramsey, a large, pleasant man, pours drinks for the<br>
    away team. He's dressed in a subdued version of the<br>
    male native dress.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We haven't much time, Mister<br>
    Ramsey. The Enterprise has urgent<br>
    business elsewhere.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    Certainly we have time for a<br>
    drink.</p>
  <p> Troi and Tasha take the offered drinks. He raises his<br>
    in silent toast, takes a sip, and:</p>

  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How did you find me?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually, it was quite simple.<br>
    I accessed all possible elements<br>
    available to the crew of the Odin,<br>
    cross-referenced those to elements<br>
    endemic to Angel One, then<br>
    eliminated the common<br>
    denominators. Angel One has no<br>
    platinum. Enterprise scanners<br>
    did the rest.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    Platinum, was it?</p>
  <p> Ramsey pulls a PENDANT on a CHAIN from around his neck<br>
    INTO VIEW.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My wings. I kept them for their<br>
    sentimental value.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Where are the other survivors,<br>
    Mister Ramsey?</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    Oh, they're nearby. Packing, as<br>
    a matter of fact, since we can<br>
    no longer remain here. As the<br>
    unofficial leader of our little<br>
    group, I've been chosen to speak<br>
    for us all.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Marooned seven years on an alien<br>
    planet. Rather than excitement<br>
    or anticipation at being rescued,<br>
    I sense a feeling of calm in you.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    What is it you think you're<br>
    rescuing me from? My shipmates<br>
    and I have all taken wives. A<br>
    few even have children. You can't<br>
    &quot;rescue&quot; a man from the place he<br>
    calls his home.</p>
  <p> Home? This is getting more complicated by the moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>42 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Trent is no longer in the room. Beata and Riker,<br>
    seated comfortably on a lounge, each have a drink.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... Why were you so hesitant at<br>
    first to tell us about the Odin<br>
    survivors?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Simply because Ramsey and his men<br>
    are anarchists. Tampering with<br>
    the laws of nature. Obsessed with<br>
    spreading untruths, and<br>
    encouraging dissent among our<br>
    people. I had to be certain you<br>
    weren't here to fuel their<br>
    struggle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not our place to interfere<br>
    in the domestic affairs of other<br>
    societies.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Not you, perhaps, because you<br>
    understand a man's place. But<br>
    Ramsey is not so well-mannered.<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    Sometimes I fear that it is<br>
    actually the men who are the<br>
    clever ones, enjoying all that<br>
    life has to offer while we women<br>
    devote ourselves to the drudgery<br>
    of making life work.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In our society, men and women<br>
    share equally in all that life<br>
    has to offer.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Don't misunderstand me, Riker.<br>
    I'd be the last to imply that men<br>
    are in any way inferior to women.<br>
    But, after all, men are... men --<br>
    with a natural place in the scheme<br>
    of things.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (amused)<br>
    We gave up those distinctions<br>
    centuries ago. In our world,<br>
    equality among the sexes is so<br>
    well established, we no longer<br>
    consider it an issue.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (humoring him)<br>
    You deny that differences exist<br>
    between men and women?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We not only acknowledge the<br>
    differences. We delight in them.</p>
  <p> The mood is growing a bit more seductive.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    That's so like a man. So<br>
    emotional. What would we do<br>
    without you... ?</p>
  <p> A question she is about to answer with a kiss. But<br>
    the moment is cut short by a NOISE o.s. Both REACT<br>
    to:</p>
  <p>43 ANGLE - TRENT</p>
  <p> ENTERING with the metallic box. Taking the box:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Trent.</p>
  <p> Trent continues to stand. Dismissing him:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    You may go.</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Trent EXITS. Riker offers Beata the<br>
    metallic box.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With compliments of the USS<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Their hands linger at the touch before Riker finally<br>
    pulls his away. Beata opens the box and withdraws a<br>
    large, clear, octagonal CRYSTAL.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's called an Albeni meditation<br>
    crystal.</p>
  <p> Riker removes a small striking bar from the box, taps<br>
    the crystal. It comes to life, producing a warm GOLDEN<br>
    GLOW and accompanying resonant HUM.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Very impressive.</p>
  <p> Riker puts his hand over the crystal to turn it off.<br>
    Beata covers his hand with her own. There's a lot of<br>
    heat between these two, and it's no secret.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And now, of course, I must repay<br>
    you in kind.</p>
  <p> She leans to kiss Riker. He submits. Willingly.</p>
  <p>44 INT. HIDEOUT - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Ramsey paces the small place, the away team watching,<br>
    listening to:</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    ... Five months in a rescue pod<br>
    no bigger than this room is an<br>
    eternity I hope none of you ever<br>
    have to face. When we finally<br>
    made it here, we all thought we'd<br>
    died and gone to heaven. You've<br>
    seen the women of the planet --<br>
    tall and strong and lovely.</p>
  <p> Shakes his head, remembering his moment of realization:</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But once the newness wore off,<br>
    we started to see how men on this<br>
    planet were treated. No vote,<br>
    no opinions... no respect.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    None of which is any longer your<br>
    concern, Mister Ramsey. Call the<br>
    others in, please. It's time to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    Despite its problems, Lieutenant,<br>
    we like it here on Angel One.<br>
    (simply)<br>
    We're not going anywhere.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But Mistress Beata --</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Mistress Beata be damned! Her<br>
    wish is not my command. And<br>
    neither is yours. You can't force<br>
    us to go.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Ramsey is correct,<br>
    Counselor. The Odin was not a<br>
    starship, which means its crew<br>
    is not bound by the Prime<br>
    Directive. If he and the other<br>
    survivors wish to stay here, there<br>
    is absolutely nothing we can do.</p>
  <p> Tasha and Troi exchange a look, a shrug.</p>

  <p>46 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> SHOOTING from the lab area, WE CAN SEE the room is<br>
    overflowing with beds of sick crewmembers. A line of<br>
    newly infected has formed in the doorway. Beverly is<br>
    busy with her research when:</p>

    Bridge to Sickbay -- how are you<br>
    Doing, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>47 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT AS REQUIRED)</p>
  <p> Geordi, nursing a stiff neck of his own, listens:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've been forced to confine over<br>
    three hundred to their private<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're going to be seriously<br>
    undermanned if we're forced to<br>
    engage the Romulans in battle.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Romulans are your problem,<br>
    Lieutenant. Trying to find an<br>
    innoculant is mine. This virus<br>
    mutates every twenty minutes.<br>
    On the positive side, the virus<br>
    is debilitating -- but so far we<br>
    haven't had any fatalities.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If this continues, there'll be<br>
    no one left to run the ship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If it continues, no one will be<br>
    healthy enough to care.</p>
  <p> (END INTERCUT) Geordi surveys his undermanned bridge.<br>
    If anything, his neck seems even stiffer.</p>

  <p> Data and Troi standing by. Ramsey watching.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Prepare to beam three back to our<br>

    we regroup with Commander Riker,<br>
    we'll return to the ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Suggest you make that on the<br>
    double. We have a real medical<br>
    emergency brewing up here. A<br>
    third of the crew is down. And<br>
    the latest report from the Neutral<br>
    Zone outpost is that more Romulan<br>
    battlecrusiers are entering the<br>
    area.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'll inform the commander.<br>
    (then, to Ramsey)<br>
    One thing before we go. You said<br>
    you were expecting us. Why?</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    I'm sorry. I can't tell you.</p>
  <p> The away team accepts this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We wish you well, Mister Ramsey.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>

    Energize!</p>
  <p> Our away team DEMATERIALIZES. Beat. Ramsey goes to<br>
    a door, opens it, speaking off:</p>

    They are gone.</p>
  <p> Beat. OUT steps Ariel. They embrace.</p>
  <p>49 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON the Albeni mediation crystal. Beata's hand<br>
    reaches INTO FRAME, taps the crystal with the striking<br>
    bar. It GLOWS, HUMS. PAN off the crystal to the<br>
    lounge where Riker and Beata are wrapped in each<br>
    other's arms. There are caresses and kisses as<br>
    counterpoint to:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    It is such a refreshing change<br>
    to be with a man who knows what<br>
    he wants.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You mean without a woman having<br>
    to tell him?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Exactly! I knew you were bright<br>
    enough to understand. Women, by<br>
    our very nature, want only what<br>
    is best for their men.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Men are not objects to be<br>
    possessed, Mistress Beata.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (humoring him)<br>
    Of course they're not. It was<br>
    merely a figure of speech.</p>
  <p> A BELL o.s. The kiss continues. Another BELL.<br>
    Angered by the interruption, Beata reaches out to quiet<br>
    the Albeni crystal before sharply calling off:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p>50 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Trent ENTERS the chamber. &quot;Don't kill the<br>
    messenger&quot; is practically stamped on his forehead.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Why do you bother me?</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    Forgive the disturbance, Elected<br>
    One...</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I expect so little from this sorry<br>
    excuse for a man. Perhaps even<br>
    that much is too much...</p>
  <p> She is on her feet, charging the smaller man.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is so important you find it<br>
    necessary to intrude on my<br>
    privacy?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    They have returned, Mistress.<br>
    But without Ramsey or the others.</p>
  <p> Trent motions off, and IN WALK Data, Tasha and Troi.<br>
    Riker rises on their entrance.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Your advanced technology has<br>
    proven inadequate?</p>
  <p> Rather than answer her, the away team turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What happened, Troi?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mister Ramsey and the other<br>
    survivors refuse to leave.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    But you promised!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considers, and:)<br>
    I'm sorry. There's nothing else<br>
    we can do.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    I am sorry as well.</p>
  <p> She moves to sit behind her desk.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Since you refuse to take them with<br>
    you, I am left with no choice...<br>
    but to sentence them all to death.</p>
  <p> On Riker's REACTION, we:</p>

  <p> Beverly, a thermos-like container in hand, ENTERS.<br>
    Picard makes no pretense of health as he shivers under<br>
    his blankets. Beverly squirts a serving of green<br>
    liquid into a cup. He's too weak to take the cup.<br>
    She lifts his head, holding the cup to his lips. He<br>
    resists.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It looks horrible, tastes worse --<br>
    but it's absolutely guaranteed to<br>
    make you feel better.</p>
  <p> Picard gulps, nearly choking on a mouthful of the foul<br>
    brew. He sputters, growls, twisting up his face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    New cologne?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (coughs, groans)<br>
    Same... you gave me last birthday.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Uh-uh, different. Like something<br>
    I smelled earlier. Something...<br>
    I don't know... like a flower I<br>
    remember. Something Klingon, I<br>
    think.</p>

    It's that smell! That must be<br>

    What's the latest on the<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Crusher feels the virus<br>
    will undoubtedly run unchecked<br>
    through the entire ship's<br>
    contingent. Attempts to develop<br>
    an innoculant have so far ended<br>
    in failure. Lieutenant La Forge<br>
    still has the Conn pending your<br>

    What about the Romulans in the<br>
    Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The border outpost reports a<br>
    contingent of seven Romulan<br>
    battlecruisers within sensor<br>
    range. The USS Berlin has<br>
    answered their distress call, and<br>
    is standing by. However, should<br>
    hostilities erupt, the outpost<br>
    and the starship will be<br>
    outgunned. It is felt that the<br>
    Enterprise's presence in the area<br>
    will be a vital show of force.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Some show of force. The<br>
    Enterprise may be able to fly on<br>
    autopilot. But with that virus<br>
    knocking down our crew, we're<br>
    going to be in sorry shape if<br>
    things turn ugly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Romulans won't know our<br>
    strength, Lieutenant.<br>
    (glancing around)<br>
    It's time for us to leave this<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It feels terribly wrong to leave<br>
    while Beata is determined to<br>
    execute those people.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She has to find them first.<br>
    Ramsey and his bunch have been<br>
    fugitives for years. I suspect<br>
    he's pretty good at evading<br>
    capture. As cold as it sounds<br>
    we're going to have to treat this<br>
    mission as if it never happened.<br>
    Everything will remain exactly<br>
    as it was before we arrived.</p>
  <p> A COMMOTION o.s., and they turn to see:</p>

  <p>55 BEATA AND THE PARLIAMENTARIANS</p>
  <p> FILING INTO the Hall, taking their seats. Ariel is<br>
    not among them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (low, to team)<br>
    Something is wrong.</p>
  <p> The away team's attention is focused on Beata even as<br>
    her attention is on them. Finally:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Your presence on Angel One no<br>
    longer amuses me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Amusement was never our intention,<br>
    Mistress.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Before you go back to your ship,<br>
    there is something I wish you to<br>
    see.</p>
  <p> She nods to a guard near the far door. The guard opens<br>
    the door, and other guards lead Ramsey, three male<br>
    earthlings, two other native women and a handful of<br>
    native men into the hall.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    We were no harm to anyone. Why<br>
    did you tell them where to find<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Don't blame them, Ramsey. You<br>
    brought this upon yourself.<br>
    You... and the traitor.</p>
  <p> She glances to the guard near the door she and the<br>
    Parliamentarians used. The guard opens this door,<br>
    EXITS... only to RETURN half a beat later with Ariel<br>
    in tow. Ariel and Ramsey exchange a pained look.</p>

    One doesn't need the technology<br>
    of the Enterprise to follow<br>
    Mistress Ariel sneaking off to<br>
    warn her husband.<br>
    (to Guard)<br>
    Let her stand with him now...</p>
  <p> The Guard leads Ariel to Ramsey's side, into his arms<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... For tomorrow they will die<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> Off our away team's REACTIONS, we find ourselves:</p>
  <p>56 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit.</p>
  <p>57 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Beverly, medical tricorder in hand, is examining<br>
    Geordi. He looks terrible, feels worse. Otherwise,<br>
    the bridge is empty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're out of commission, Geordi.<br>
    Report to your quarters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (in horrible pain)<br>
    Can't leave my post... until I'm<br>
    relieved.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've been aboard the Enterprise<br>
    long enough to know she's designed<br>
    to run herself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But the innoculant --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can do my research on the<br>
    computers here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then I can convalesce here.</p>
  <p> Geordi holds his position, sick as he is. Beverly<br>
    resigns herself to taking the seat adjacent. She's<br>
    not at all pleased with what's happening. What's worse<br>
    is -- she's beginning to feel ill herself.</p>
  <p>58 INT. ANGEL ONE EXECUTIVE OFFICE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Riker stands before the desk, fighting to draw Beata's<br>
    attention from the stack of paperwork she<br>
    intentionally hides behind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You claim to be an advanced<br>
    society, yet you resort to tyranny<br>
    and executions in order to<br>
    suppress those who don't share<br>
    your views.</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    I don't expect you to understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why? Because I'm only a man?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    You'll accomplish nothing with<br>
    that attitude.</p>
  <p> Riker counts to ten, and:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mistress Beata, if you could avoid<br>
    executing Ramsey and his<br>
    followers, would you do so?</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    Is that not the way of an advanced<br>
    society?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then let us talk to men from the<br>
    Odin one last time. Let me try<br>
    to convince them to leave with<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEATA<br>
    But what of the others? Their<br>
    minds have been poisoned. Will<br>
    you also include those from this<br>
    planet who unwisely chose to<br>
    follow Ramsey and his group?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. All of them.</p>
  <p> Beata considers this.</p>
  <p>59 INT. HOLDING AREA - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Ramsey, Ariel, and the others sit, stand or lean in<br>
    the cramped area like ancient Christians awaiting dawn<br>
    and the inevitable lions. All react to:</p>
  <p>60 ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Troi and Tasha are allowed into the room<br>
    by a Guard who closes and locks the door behind them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mistress Beata is giving you a<br>
    second chance. We're prepared<br>
    to take your entire group with<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    That's very kind of you, sir, but<br>
    we're not going.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Haven't you been paying attention,<br>
    Ramsey? You're scheduled to be<br>
    executed tomorrow.</p>
  <p> A glance to his followers, all of whom are listening,<br>
    confirms his resolve.</p>
  <p> RAMSEY<br>
    We don't want to die. We don't<br>
    want to leave, either. I'm not<br>
    Academy educated, but I've studied<br>
    a little history. The ancient<br>
    Christians faced their lions, the<br>
    natives of the African continent<br>
    faced their suppressors.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RAMSEY (Cont'd)<br>
    Even the women of the twentieth century<br>
    chose to settle for nothing but<br>
    full equality.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's no time to debate the<br>
    issues, Ramsey. We're taking you<br>
    with us whether you choose to go<br>
    or not.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me, Commander, but removing<br>
    any of these people against their<br>
    will would be a violation of<br>
    several Starfleet regulations,<br>
    not the least of which would be<br>
    the Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    I realize that, Data.<br>
    (softly)<br>
    But I'd rather be facing a court<br>
    martial than trying to live with<br>
    the guilt of leaving these people<br>
    to their deaths.<br>
    (into Com)<br>
    Commander Riker to Enterprise.</p>
  <p>61 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (into Com)<br>
    This is the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Our away team share a look.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Things must be worse up there than<br>
    we thought.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor, where is Lieutenant La<br>
    Forge?</p>
  <p> For the first time, WE SEE Geordi, barely conscious<br>
    in the command chair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's right here, Will, but he's<br>
    in no shape to be here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're on our way, Doctor.<br>
    There'll be fourteen to beam up.<br>
    Two groups, five each. I'll be<br>
    in the last group of four.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid I can't allow that,<br>
    Will. The virus is totally out<br>
    of control. Until I know exactly<br>
    what I'm dealing with, I can't<br>
    let anyone new be exposed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There are people facing certain<br>
    death down here, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They could well be facing the same<br>
    thing up here, Will. I have no<br>
    idea what effect living on Angel<br>
    One might have on a person's<br>
    immune system. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> REACTIONS all around.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood.<br>
    (considers, then:)<br>
    Doctor -- would this virus have<br>
    any effect on Data?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    None that I can imagine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're going back alone, Data.<br>
    We have no idea what the Romulans<br>
    plan to do to that outpost.<br>
    You're going to have to get the<br>
    Enterprise to the Neutral Zone<br>
    before it's too late.</p>
  <p> Reading Data's pause as uncertainty:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's a direct order, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Neutral Zone before it is too<br>
    late. Understood, Commander.</p>
  <p>62 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (into Com)<br>
    This is Data, standing by to beam<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> Data DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p>63 ANGLE - OUR AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> turning now to look at tomorrow's intended victims.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And what of them?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know, Deanna.</p>
  <p> And on this uncertain fate, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>64 EXT. ANGEL ONE - DAY - ESTABLISH</p>
  <p>65 INT. ANGEL ONE - GUEST QUARTERS - DAY</p>
  <p> A sleepless night has been spent by all. Trent ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    Mistress Beata invites you to<br>
    witness this morning's<br>
    reaffirmation of Angel One's moral<br>
    imperative.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Is that supposed to be the fancy<br>
    name for murder on this planet?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Send Mistress Beata our regrets.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    The Elected One will not look<br>
    fondly upon --</p>
  <p> Trent's admonishment is cut short by:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    They are still here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (into Com, angry:)<br>
    This is Commander Riker.</p>
  <p>66 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (INTERCUT AS DESIRED)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I gave you a direct order to head<br>
    for the Neutral Zone immediately.<br>
    Explain the delay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To be precise, Commander, you<br>
    ordered me to reach the Neutral<br>
    Zone &quot;before it is too late.&quot;<br>
    I have computed the length of time<br>
    the border outpost and USS Berlin<br>
    can safely withstand a Romulan<br>
    attack... deducted our time to<br>
    destination at maximum warp speed.<br>
    That leaves Doctor Crusher with<br>
    forty-eight more minutes to<br>
    complete her research and develop<br>
    an innoculant to the virus.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (energized)<br>
    Which means there's still time<br>
    for us to do something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Forty-eight minutes... I think<br>
    we're down to splitting hairs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Splitting hairs is a figure of<br>
    speech I recognize, Commander.<br>
    Speaking for those whose hair is<br>
    soon to be split, forty-eight<br>
    minutes may make a great deal of<br>
    difference.<br>
    (refers to console)<br>
    Excuse me -- forty-seven minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considering:)<br>
    Perhaps, Data, just perhaps.<br>
    (then)<br>
    Thanks for following my orders<br>
    so precisely, Data. Riker out.</p>
  <p> (END INTERCUT) Riker turns to Trent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    On second thought, Trent, we would<br>
    be honored to watch your moral<br>
    imperative in action.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>67 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY - (TO BE WRITTEN)</p>
  <p> Lots of folk. Tasha, Troi and Riker. Ramsey and<br>
    Ariel. Ramsey's merry band of followers. Guards.<br>
    Beata. The Parliamentarians. Trent. Anyone else we<br>
    can find and costume. It's hangin' time.</p>
  <p> The thrust of this scene is Riker trying to convince<br>
    Beata that the execution of Ramsey will not halt what<br>
    can only be perceived as an irrevocable evolutionary<br>
    cycle in Angel One's societal development.</p>
  <p> After getting Beata to admit that Ramsey and his<br>
    followers are merely symbols of a change that preceded<br>
    their arrival on Angel One, Riker is quick to point<br>
    out that executing these people will only make martyrs<br>
    of them. That, in fact, to kill them will accelerate<br>
    rather than stop or retard the coming equality between<br>
    the sexes of Angel One. Riker might even point out<br>
    similar occurrences in Earth's history... I don't<br>
    know... depends on how clever he is.</p>
  <p> Nevertheless, Riker is able to demonstrate to our<br>
    audience, and Beata, that executing Ramsey, et al, will<br>
    be counterproductive.</p>
  <p> The ladies adjourn to caucus.</p>
  <p>68 INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY (TO BE WRITTEN)</p>
  <p> Our away team waits. They're running out of time.<br>
    They explore their options. Hey, it's a short scene.</p>
  <p>69 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit.</p>
  <p>70 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data moves from station to station, checking all is<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Go ahead, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>71 INT. CRUSHER'S LAB (INTERCUT AS DESIRED)</p>
  <p> Her work area shows evidence of much work. Beverly<br>
    looks tired... but very pleased.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Bingo, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Bingo? I fail to see the<br>
    relevance, Doctor. Is that not<br>
    a reference to an ancient Earth<br>
    game?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's also a reference to success,<br>
    Data. I've got the innoculant.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excellent, Doctor. And we still<br>
    have a margin of seventeen<br>
    minutes. I will inform the away<br>
    team immediately.<br>
    (changes channel)<br>
    Enterprise to Commander Riker.</p>
  <p>72 INT. ANGEL ONE GUEST QUARTERS - DAY</p>
  <p> Our Team listens as:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We are ready to have you beamed<br>
    up, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, I want you to lock the<br>
    transporter on the holding area<br>
    where they're keeping Ramsey and<br>
    the others. If we don't hear from<br>
    Beata in the next ten minutes,<br>
    you are to begin the beam up<br>
    sequence, five at a time. The<br>
    away team will beam up last.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Understood, Commander. Enterprise<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> NOISE o.s., and Trent ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TRENT<br>
    The Elected One wishes to see you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>73 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY (TO BE WRITTEN)</p>
  <p> Beata, Trent, the away team. Basically, Beata tells<br>
    Riker he's pretty smart for a man. She's given his<br>
    words a great deal of thought, sees his point, has<br>
    (with the help of her parliament) reached a decision.</p>
  <p> The Ramsey cult will not be executed. Instead, they<br>
    will be exiled to a remote part of Angel One where they<br>
    can promote all the heresy they wish. And anyone else<br>
    on Angel One who feels the same way can go with them.</p>
  <p> This solution won't stop the inevitable decay of Angel<br>
    One's cherished system, but at least it will retard<br>
    it long enough so that Beata won't have to be around<br>
    to see the damage.</p>
  <p> Beata urges them to be on their way. She strikes the<br>
    meditation crystal, giving in to its soothing warmth<br>
    as Riker belays the previous order to &quot;kidnap&quot; the<br>
    Ramsey group, and our away team DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p>74 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi and Tasha MATERIALIZE. Beverly is standing<br>
    by to inoculate the returning away team.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Welcome home.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's good to be back. Is everyone<br>
    recovering?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Slowly... but yes.</p>
  <p> He HURRIES OUT, FOLLOWED closely by Troi and Tasha.</p>
  <p>75 INT. ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard is still in bed, but he looks much better than<br>
    before. DOOR CHIME.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS his stateroom.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How are you feeling, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Angel One&quot; - 11/9/87 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the mend, thank you. Tell me<br>
    about Angel One.</p>
  <p> Troi sits next to him, ready to make her report.</p>
  <p>76 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is seated at his usual station. The turbolift<br>
    doors OPEN and OUT STEP Riker and Tasha, each hurrying<br>
    to the appropriate station. As Riker takes the center<br>
    seat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set coordinates for the Neutral<br>
    Zone, Mister Data. We have a call<br>
    to pay on the Romulans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Coordinates set, Commander. On<br>
    your mark --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    As Captain Picard would say --<br>
    make it so, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data hits the &quot;make it so&quot; buttons and:</p>
  <p>77 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> the ship breaks out of orbit and heads toward its next<br>
    adventure as we:</p>
