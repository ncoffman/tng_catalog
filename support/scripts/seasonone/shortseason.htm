  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Too Short A Season&quot; </p>
  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship circles a reddish planet. Behind both<br>
    is the backdrop of a sparkling splash of stars against<br>
    black space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V. O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41309.5.<br>
    We are in orbit around Persephone<br>
    V where I have been sent to confer<br>
    with Admiral Mark Jameson in<br>
    regard to an extraordinary<br>
    situation....</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> All other bridge personnel are in place at their usual<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet received this subspace<br>
    transmission two days ago,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> REVEALING CLOSE UP OF ADMIRAL MARK JAMESON. The<br>
    Admiral is a man of eighty, still crusty and alert,<br>
    still a Starfleet warhorse. Jameson nods briskly as:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Let's see it, Captain.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE TOWARD COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen and relay to the<br>
    admiral, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data taps his console quickly and:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>5 CLOSE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Screen FLASHES UP a sharp color picture of KARNAS<br>
    in his OFFICE. There is a desk, several chairs. The<br>
    wall behind the desk is barren, save for a set of three<br>
    weapons mounted on it. Two of the weapons are<br>
    phaser-like, but of old design and of different sizes.<br>
    One of the weapons is a short pole about two inches<br>
    in diameter with a wicked-looking blade on either end.<br>
    Karnas sits at the desk, facing INTO CAMERA. He is<br>
    in his sixties, with a formal, military bearing, a man<br>
    with a good many worry lines marking his face, a man<br>
    without many smiles.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    I am Karnas, governor of Mordan<br>
    IV. A dissident terrorist group<br>
    has taken Federation Ambassador<br>
    Hawkins and his staff hostage.<br>
    They will not discuss terms with<br>
    me. This is a crisis I cannot<br>
    resolve without assistance. The<br>
    terrorists are demanding a<br>
    Federation negotiator.</p>
  <p>6 CLOSE TWO - PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> studying the screen as Karnas speaks.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    I feel there is only one<br>
    negotiator with the skills and<br>
    understanding to resolve this<br>
    situation. The hostages' lives<br>
    will depend on Starfleet<br>
    delivering this man to Mordan.<br>
    Commander Mark Jameson.<br>
    (corrects himself)<br>
    Admiral Jameson. The terrorists<br>
    have given you six Earth days to<br>
    arrive here -- or the hostages<br>
    will die. Please...hurry.</p>
  <p> Abruptly, the Screen goes BLANK. A star b.g. appears.<br>
    It, in turn, is replaced by the IMAGE OF JAMESON.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet doesn't understand how<br>
    or why this situation developed.<br>
    Mordan IV has finally gained peace<br>
    after decades of civil war --</p>
  <p>9 INTERCUT JAMESON ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN WITH PICARD AS<br>
    NEEDED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Forty years of civil war, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, sir. Karnas was largely<br>
    responsible for the planet's<br>
    unification and peace. Why<br>
    should he suddenly be unable to<br>
    deal with rebellious factions?</p>
  <p> Jameson leans back in his chair, looking inward.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Forty-five years ago I negotiated<br>
    a hostage situation on Mordan.<br>
    Karnas was a young man then....<br>
    (light chuckle)<br>
    ... but so was I. He seems to feel<br>
    I can handle the situation again.<br>
    Obviously Starfleet feels that<br>
    way too, or you wouldn't be here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I'm detailed to take you to Mordan<br>
    IV as soon as you can be ready,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    My wife and I will beam aboard<br>
    at 1500 hours, Captain. Be<br>
    prepared to depart this starbase<br>
    and proceed immediately to Mordan<br>
    IV. Acknowledge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Received and acknowledged, sir.<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nearly 1500 now, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Well, Number One. Why don't we<br>
    go and welcome the admiral aboard?</p>
  <p>12 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER CHIEF,<br>
    PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker ENTER, glancing toward the platform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral Jameson, sir. Have you<br>
    met him before?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your hero, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not only mine. My father served<br>
    on the Falcon with him. I grew<br>
    up on stories about Mark Jameson.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I've heard all the legends about<br>
    him, too. Not only the Falcon's<br>
    missions and the Mordan rescue,<br>
    but the Gettysburg's explorations,<br>
    his command of the old Pegasus<br>
    in the Klingon conflicts....</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE AT TRANSPORTER</p>
  <p> Two Figures are BEGINNING TO MATERIALIZE on the pads.<br>
    As the TRANSPORTER EFFECT AND SOUND DIE DOWN Jameson<br>
    and his wife, ANNE, FULLY MATERIALIZED. Jameson appears<br>
    as he did on the Main Viewscreen -- except WE NOW SEE<br>
    he has been confined to a &quot;physical support chair,&quot;<br>
    which greatly inhibits the physical movements of his<br>
    lower body. The chair is enclosed around his hips and<br>
    legs, hiding them from our view.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Anne Jameson is seventy, slim, one of those especially<br>
    graced women whose face still shows the looks that made<br>
    her a beautiful young woman. Picard and Riker exchange<br>
    a quick glance; the admiral's physical condition is a<br>
    surprise. Then they move forward as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard, Admiral.<br>
    (indicating Riker)<br>
    My executive officer, Commander<br>
    William Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My pleasure, sir.<br>
    (a nod to Anne)<br>
    Ma'am.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    My wife, Anne.</p>
  <p> Anne smiles graciously at Picard and Riker.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Captain, there are certain details<br>
    of this mission that you should<br>
    understand before we begin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this the place to be discussing<br>
    them, sir?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Why not? You and your first<br>
    officer are both here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Captain, I am not simply an<br>
    advisor. On any assignment I<br>
    accompany, Starfleet has<br>
    designated me Senior Mission<br>
    Officer. I control the Away Team<br>
    and all its actions. Is that<br>
    understood?</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a surprised look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>14 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He seems quite pleased with himself -- but also<br>
    concerned for Picard's feelings.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Of course, Captain, you will<br>
    command the ship -- but the<br>
    mission is mine. I trust you<br>
    are in complete agreement.</p>
  <p>15 ON PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> nonplussed -- but what can Picard do? He puts the best<br>
    face on it he can and manages another smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, sir. Of course.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> underway at warp speed, flashing by on her urgent<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE TOWARD GEORDI AND DATA</p>
  <p> Geordi sees something on his console, turns in his<br>
    chair toward Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Response to our message coming<br>
    in from Mordan, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put it on the screen, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data nods and tabs the panel quickly.</p>
  <p>18 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Troi are in their usual positions,<br>
    with Jameson installed in his support chair on Riker's<br>
    right. They all respond with interest as:</p>
  <p> KARNAS (V.O.)<br>
    (filtered)<br>
    Mordan IV to Enterprise. This<br>
    is Karnas. I will speak to the<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Picard, in command<br>
    of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>19 ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (KARNAS'S OFFICE) Karnas is seen seated behind his<br>
    desk.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (abrupt, curt)<br>
    Is Admiral Jameson on board?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>20 ANGLE AT COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> The others glance over at Jameson, who sits up<br>
    straighter in his chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods toward Jameson)<br>
    He is here, beside my first<br>
    officer. Do you wish to speak<br>
    to him now?</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Karnas nods and squints INTO CAMERA as:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    So, Jameson.<br>
    (squints again)<br>
    I see time has not been kind.</p>
  <p>22 WIDER - INCLUDING TROI AND JAMESON</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It seldom is, Karnas. However,<br>
    we could save a good deal of it<br>
    now if you'll outline the<br>
    terrorists' demands....</p>
  <p> Troi is shifting her attention between Jameson and<br>
    Karnas (on the screen), taking in the speech and body<br>
    nuances of both men.</p>
  <p>22A ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    They insist all discussions will<br>
    take place here... on Mordan. They<br>
    refuse to speak to me -- only to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (V.O.)<br>
    They could relay their terms on<br>
    your communications channels....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>22A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    They insist on speaking face to<br>
    face when you arrive. They say<br>
    they will brook no excuses. If<br>
    there are any offered, your<br>
    ambassador and his people will<br>
    die. Unpleasantly. I believe<br>
    them -- and so should you,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (pause, then:)<br>
    Tell them I accept the conditions<br>
    of negotiation.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    I will do so immediately. Karnas<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> The IMAGE CUTS OUT, and is replaced by WARP STARS.</p>
  <p>24 ANGLE TOWARD COMMAND AREA - EMPHASIZING PICARD AND<br>
    JAMESON</p>
  <p> Jameson navigates his chair a little forward as:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For a man in his position, Karnas<br>
    doesn't seem to know much about<br>
    the situation.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Wrong, Number One. He told me<br>
    the terrorists are desperate<br>
    enough to kill if they're crossed.<br>
    They're willing to talk one on<br>
    one, but not to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    From his body language as well<br>
    as his words and tone... I'd judge<br>
    that what Karnas said was honest,<br>
    but I sensed a holding back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps he knows more about the<br>
    terrorists than he is willing to<br>
    admit.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Possible, but I suspect it's<br>
    closer to the mark if we said he<br>
    doesn't want to admit failure of<br>
    his own efforts to negotiate.<br>
    He is a proud man.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That could be, sir. Karnas has<br>
    established himself as a powerful<br>
    man on Mordan. Suddenly -- in<br>
    this situation -- his power is<br>
    useless.</p>
  <p> Interrupted by:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to bridge. I am ready<br>
    for Admiral Jameson now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is on his way, Doctor.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    On my way to what, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just a routine medical checkup.<br>
    Ship's regulations.</p>
  <p>25 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> His expression flickers just slightly, but he nods<br>
    toward Picard, acquiescing.</p>
  <p>26 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> watching Jameson. She frowns as she senses something<br>
    behind Jameson's apparent agreement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>27 INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Pardon me, sir, but refusing a<br>
    simple medical check --</p>
  <p> CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE JAMESON.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm sorry, Doctor, but it isn't<br>
    necessary.<br>
    (hands her a tiny disk)<br>
    The chief medical officer on<br>
    Starbase 45 ran a complete battery<br>
    of tests on me two days ago.<br>
    Semi-annual exam. You'll find<br>
    I've been a victim of Iverson's<br>
    Disease for five years. My<br>
    &quot;case,&quot; as you doctors like to<br>
    call it, is now chronic. In<br>
    another year, it will undoubtedly<br>
    progress to terminal.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry --</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    No need. I do not accept the<br>
    prognosis, Doctor. But right now,<br>
    I don't have time to waste, and<br>
    there's no point in you wasting<br>
    your time either.<br>
    (indicates disk)<br>
    There's your information.</p>
  <p> Beverly considers only briefly. Commanders don't win<br>
    arguments with admirals.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you, Admiral. I'll look<br>
    them over.</p>
  <p>28 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling at warp speed, as before.</p>
  <p>29 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - WIDE SHOT</p>
  <p> Gathered around the desk are Picard, Riker, Data, Troi<br>
    and Jameson.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What I don't understand, sir, is<br>
    how Karnas knew you were still...<br>
    available.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Still alive, you mean.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (unembarrassed)<br>
    So far as Karnas knew, you might<br>
    have been dead, sir.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Quite right, Commander. But I'm<br>
    not, and I imagine Ambassador<br>
    Hawkins told him that. I briefed<br>
    the ambassador about Mordan<br>
    before he left to take up<br>
    residence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Karnas has a problem<br>
    he feels you can handle. What<br>
    can the terrorists want that<br>
    Karnas can't or won't give them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mordan has had peace for five<br>
    years. They have finally come<br>
    to a state of productivity that<br>
    satisfies their planetary needs,<br>
    but no more than that. Perhaps<br>
    the dissidents feel the Federation<br>
    can provide more -- technology,<br>
    science, agricultural<br>
    assistance....</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I've negotiated many a treaty on<br>
    many planets, Picard. I've found<br>
    that peace -- or the appearance<br>
    of it -- is often a prelude to<br>
    war.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Admiral are you suggesting the<br>
    terrorists want arms and weapons?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    They may. I am suggesting Karnas<br>
    is the last man to give them such<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Karnas worked and fought for<br>
    years to achieve peace.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    And he's not likely to throw it<br>
    away... even for the lives of the<br>
    hostages.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see. You believe Karnas won't<br>
    negotiate on that point, so the<br>
    terrorists demanded an outside<br>
    negotiator.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I know Karnas. He is a warrior...<br>
    he lives for challenge. These<br>
    people have insulted his honor<br>
    by taking the embassy staff<br>
    hostage. I'll negotiate -- but<br>
    I'll have to be very careful in<br>
    handling Karnas. He'll want<br>
    revenge for that insult.</p>
  <p> He looks around at them challengingly, daring them to<br>
    debate it. No one cares to argue with the expert, but<br>
    Troi still studies Jameson with particular interest.</p>
  <p>30 INT. JAMESON QUARTERS - ANNE AND JAMESON</p>
  <p> Anne is straightening out the final details of their<br>
    quarters, putting away clothing items, etc. As Jameson<br>
    ROLLS IN, seated in the support chair:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (mildly teasing)<br>
    ... You're late. Couldn't get away<br>
    from the bridge?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Didn't want to. It feels good<br>
    to be on one again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (going to him)<br>
    I'm glad, Mark.<br>
    (touches chair)<br>
    Do you want me to help you up?</p>
  <p> Jameson waves her off, opens the front of the chair,<br>
    and lifts himself out of it into a regular chair. Anne<br>
    stares at him, somewhat surprised.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    You're stronger today...</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm fine. Feel like a kid again.</p>
  <p> Anne touches his face gently, smiling at him. Sure --<br>
    there are the good days. She pecks him on the cheek,<br>
    turns away to put away some final item.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    This ship is magnificent. Pity<br>
    we didn't have them twenty, thirty<br>
    years ago. We could have been<br>
    together almost all of your<br>
    career.</p>
  <p>31 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> as her voice comes OVER, we see he is beginning to feel<br>
    pain... gradually at first, and then getting worse... and<br>
    worse.</p>
  <p> ANNE (V.O.)<br>
    It's so good to be able to be with<br>
    you now.</p>
  <p>32 TWO SHOT</p>
  <p> A GASP from Jameson as he can no longer contain the<br>
    pain. Anne swings around sharply, hurries to him.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark! I'll call Sickbay --</p>
  <p> His hand shoots out and traps her wrist, nailing her in<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    No! There's no need. It's<br>
    happened before --</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    When? You haven't said anything<br>
    --</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It'll pass... give me a moment....</p>
  <p> She watches him, concerned, caring. And the pain does<br>
    die away from his face, loosening its grip. His hand<br>
    on her arm loosens, too; and she absently rubs her<br>
    wrist where his fingers dug in and left deep red marks.<br>
    She's more worried about him than herself.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    See... I'm better. It's going<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    What is it? Do the doctors know?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Just body changes... My last<br>
    checkup, they said I'd have to<br>
    expect it.</p>
  <p> He notices she is still rubbing her arm, and he reaches<br>
    out to touch her gently.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    You're sure? Don't lie to me.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> He holds out his arms, and she bends into his embrace.<br>
    They hold each other very tightly -- old lovers still<br>
    in love.</p>
  <p>33 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - TWO SHOT - BEVERLY AND<br>
    PICARD</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... All the medical information<br>
    the admiral provided is<br>
    satisfactory, sir....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (it's routine)<br>
    Excellent, Doctor --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (overriding)<br>
    Except for one thing.</p>
  <p> Picard gives her an inquiring look and waits for it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The test results he gave me aren't<br>
    two days old, they're two months<br>
    old. The medical file coder<br>
    always includes the date as part<br>
    of the file number. He lied to<br>
    me, sir -- and I don't know why.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is eighty years old, Doctor.<br>
    For some, the memory begins to<br>
    fail....</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He suffers from Iverson's Disease,<br>
    sir. It affects the body -- not<br>
    the mind. I just have a gut<br>
    feeling he's hiding something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd expect that observation from<br>
    Counselor Troi, but --<br>
    (on her sharp look)<br>
    I respect your opinion, Doctor.<br>
    And I'll want you on the bridge<br>
    for the next day or so. The<br>
    admiral has to remain in the best<br>
    of health for these negotiations.<br>
    He might require your services.</p>
  <p> The level look he exchanges with her tells her a lot.<br>
    Picard respects her judgment -- and he's uneasy about<br>
    the situation. She nods to him, she'll go with it.</p>
  <p>34 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's personal log... I am<br>
    puzzled and somewhat concerned<br>
    by the dating error Admiral<br>
    Jameson made on his medical<br>
    records.</p>
  <p>35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> All regulars at their stations, Jameson in the support<br>
    chair surveying information at Science Station 2, near<br>
    Worf. Beverly is seated on the guest bench near Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rises, turns to<br>
    Jameson)<br>
    Admiral, we're approaching the<br>
    Idini Star Cluster. Would you<br>
    like to take the Conn as we make<br>
    transit?</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He turns slightly in the chair and smiles at Picard.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Thank you, Captain. I would.</p>
  <p> And then he swings away the enclosing front section of<br>
    the support chair, rises and walks toward the ramp.</p>
  <p>37 INTERCUT REACTIONS - ALL KEY BRIDGE PERSONNEL</p>
  <p> staring at Jameson as he moves a little unsteadily but<br>
    entirely on his own down the ramp. Halfway down, he<br>
    stumbles slightly, and Riker reaches out a hand to him.<br>
    Jameson waves him away, regains his balance and MOVES<br>
    ACROSS to Picard.</p>
  <p>38 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> She is frowning deeply, not liking what she sees.</p>
  <p>39 AT THE COMMAND CHAIR</p>
  <p> Picard reins in his surprise, quickly collects himself.<br>
    Jameson is grinning, pleased with his feat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Admiral. Quite a little<br>
    surprise you've pulled on us.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. Quite.</p>
  <p> Jameson shoots a look at Beverly, nods to her.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Neglected to mention... I began<br>
    some new therapy before I left.<br>
    Seems to be working. I haven't<br>
    felt this good since the last time<br>
    I was in space. The Gettysburg.<br>
    All I needed to get me out of that<br>
    chair was the thought of walking<br>
    the decks in command of a starship<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> Beverly stares at him, impassive -- and not buying<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... you only have the Conn<br>
    temporarily.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (laughs lightly)<br>
    Figure of speech. Of course she's<br>
    your ship.<br>
    (takes the chair)<br>
    I'll just keep an eye on her for<br>
    a while.</p>
  <p> As he continues to smile genially at Picard:</p>

  <p>40 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling at warp speed.</p>
  <p>41 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD, BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Picard has led the doctor into the room; Beverly is<br>
    still disturbed by what has happened. As the door<br>
    closes behind them, Picard turns to face her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The admiral displayed a remarkable<br>
    improvement out there, wouldn't<br>
    you say?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, no one recovers from<br>
    Iverson's Disease. There is no<br>
    known cure, and there are no cases<br>
    where it has gone into remission.<br>
    I haven't heard of any new<br>
    therapy that would have results<br>
    like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then how do you account for it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't. All I can tell you is<br>
    that the admiral has been confined<br>
    to the support chair for four<br>
    years by the effects of Iverson's.<br>
    By all the medical facts we know,<br>
    he should never have walked again.</p>
  <p> Picard considers that, finally looks up at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like you to look into it,<br>
    Doctor. Thoroughly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 20.</p>

  <p>43 INT. JAMESON QUARTERS - ANGLE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He is seated at a desk, studying a personal Viewer.<br>
    NOTE: The light is dim here, turned down so he can see<br>
    the screen better.</p>
  <p>44 CLOSE ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jameson is reviewing the Karnas message seen in the<br>
    Teaser.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    The terrorists have given you<br>
    six Earth days to bring him here<br>
    -- or the hostages will die.<br>
    Please...hurry.</p>
  <p>45 WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING ANNE</p>
  <p> (Viewer o.s.) She comes into the main room from the<br>
    bedroom area as:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    I don't know how much more<br>
    information you think you can get<br>
    out of that tape.</p>
  <p> He rises, walks easily toward her, still in DIM LIGHT.<br>
    Anne stops, staring at him.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark... ? My God... what happened?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It's a new therapy I've been<br>
    taking. It's -- working, Anne.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (runs to him)<br>
    Oh, Mark!</p>
  <p> He puts his arms around her, gives her a warm kiss.<br>
    In fact, as she responds, his kiss gets warmer. His<br>
    hands move toward a more intimate position. Anne pulls<br>
    back slightly, surprised by the sudden sensuality from<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark... ?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I told you I just needed to get<br>
    back into space again.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (studies him)<br>
    You're really looking much<br>
    better....</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It's the new treatment.</p>
  <p>46 EMPHASIZING ANNE</p>
  <p> She is frowning a little.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    No... come here....</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (makes another grab for<br>
    her)<br>
    I hope you're heading for the<br>
    bedroom.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Stop it, Mark.</p>
  <p> She takes his hand, leads him into the brighter area<br>
    of the room where a mirror hangs on the wall. As he<br>
    COMES INTO BRIGHTER LIGHT, WE SEE far more changes<br>
    about him than just the smoother walk. His hair has<br>
    darkened, lost some of the gray. Some of the deep<br>
    wrinkles in his face have softened. Anne moves<br>
    Jameson in front of the mirror and, in this brighter<br>
    light, she stares at him in shock.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark, you look like you did twenty<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    You're flattering me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>47 TWO SHOT</p>
  <p> Anne looks up at him, frightened and angry.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark, what the hell is going on?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I don't know what --</p>
  <p> He suddenly breaks off, nearly falls to the floor,<br>
    wracked with intense pain. As an anguished CRY escapes<br>
    him, Anne reaches out to him.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark!</p>
  <p> Jameson goes to his knees, then collapses on his side.<br>
    Anne runs to the companel and activates it, near panic.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sickbay! Medical emergency in<br>
    the admiral's quarters!</p>
  <p> Anne looks back at Jameson, who is curled into an<br>
    almost fetal position on the floor, still wracked with<br>
    intense pain. As he CRIES OUT AGAIN:</p>
  <p>48 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY AND PICARD</p>
  <p> The Captain is looking over her shoulder at the Viewer<br>
    (o.s.). It is flashing up confirming information as<br>
    she talks:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (frowning)<br>
    I've found traces of chemical<br>
    substances in his blood and tissue<br>
    samples, but none of them are in<br>
    our pharmacopeia. We're still<br>
    working on alien references to<br>
    substances like these. All I can<br>
    say is that he ingested something<br>
    that's strongly affecting his<br>
    body.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Specifics, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, there are so many things<br>
    going on here, I can't be positive<br>
    without a lot more tests.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Give me what you have now.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His red cell count is running<br>
    riot. Then there's the cellular<br>
    structure of his body tissue.<br>
    It's -- changing. I can't even<br>
    begin on that until I see what<br>
    it's changing to. His DNA is all<br>
    skewed. I don't know how it's<br>
    possible, but he even looks<br>
    younger. And Captain... there<br>
    is absolutely no sign of Iverson's<br>
    Disease.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said there is no cure for<br>
    Iverson's.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    None we know of. Whatever else<br>
    these substances are doing to his<br>
    body, at least they've done that<br>
    for him. But how or why, I can't<br>
    say on the information I have now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get me some answers, Doctor. As<br>
    soon as possible.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard STRIDES OUT, and Beverly looks after him,<br>
    crinkles her nose slightly. Easy for him to say.</p>
  <p>49 INT. JAMESONS' QUARTERS - ANGLE AT THE DOOR</p>
  <p> as Picard ENTERS. Anne comes to meet him, concerned<br>
    and frightened -- more than we'd expect her to be.</p>

    Captain....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are some questions I have<br>
    to ask the admiral, Mrs. Jameson.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (O.S.)<br>
    Ask away. There's nothing to hide<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Picard looks o.s. at the man standing in the doorway to<br>
    the bedroom -- and goes rigid.</p>
  <p>50 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He now looks like a man in his fifties -- vital,<br>
    strong, still ready to take on the world.</p>
  <p>51 WIDER - TO INCLUDE PICARD, ANNE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (recovers himself)<br>
    Admiral -- in addition to your<br>
    rank, you are a particularly<br>
    valuable commodity just now.<br>
    Starfleet has a right to some<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> Jameson shrugs, gestures toward a group of chairs.<br>
    Picard and Anne follow him there as:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'd been planning this for a long<br>
    time -- ever since I learned I<br>
    had Iverson's Disease. Since it<br>
    put me in that chair.</p>
  <p> From her expression, this is news to Anne.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    What did you do, Mark?</p>
  <p>52 CLOSER ON THE GROUP</p>
  <p> as they sit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    There's a planet in the Cerberus<br>
    system -- Cerberus II -- they say<br>
    the natives have a process that<br>
    rejuvenates the body... gives you<br>
    your youth back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've heard that story, too. It's<br>
    a myth.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It's true, Picard. I'm the living<br>
    proof. Oh, it's dangerous -- the<br>
    mortality rate is high -- and it's<br>
    painful.<br>
    (ruefully)<br>
    Very painful. Aliens are seldom<br>
    allowed to obtain the process,<br>
    but I managed it. I negotiated<br>
    a treaty for Cerberus II several<br>
    years ago, and they felt obligated<br>
    to honor my request for the<br>
    process.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (studies him)<br>
    Obviously it works rapidly. How<br>
    does it work?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    The herb and drug combinations<br>
    are self-administered... slowly,<br>
    over a period of two years. Every<br>
    response is different, depending<br>
    on a being's DNA.<br>
    (to Anne)<br>
    I got enough for both of us, Anne<br>
    -- but I had to test it on myself<br>
    first. I couldn't risk you. If<br>
    I died... well, I was half a man<br>
    anyway, to what did it matter... ?</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    It would matter to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    But I was starting to change,<br>
    Anne. It was almost undetectable,<br>
    but the improvement was there.<br>
    Then this hostage situation came<br>
    up, and I knew I'd have to be at<br>
    my peak to deal with it. I<br>
    didn't have time to wait for the<br>
    drugs to work naturally --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You took the whole dose.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I took both of them. And look<br>
    at me! Annie, look at me. I'm<br>
    strong, alert, I'm fit. I'm<br>
    fitter than you are, Picard. And<br>
    I'm getting younger!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The only question I have, Admiral,<br>
    is why you felt it necessary to<br>
    be young to negotiate the hostage<br>
    release. Surely Karnas requested<br>
    you because of your age and<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> Jameson stares at him -- then glances away, his face<br>
    flushing. He doesn't have an answer. Picard sighs,<br>
    rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll be on the bridge, Admiral,<br>
    if you wish to talk further.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p>53 CLOSE ON ANNE</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Why didn't you tell me, Mark?<br>
    We've always been honest with each<br>
    other -- until now.</p>
  <p> CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE JAMESON as he faces her<br>
    bitter anger. The visible difference in their ages<br>
    is very apparent here.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Annie, I did it for us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    I'm sure you believed that --<br>
    until you had a chance to head<br>
    up a mission... to command again.<br>
    Then you just upended the bottle<br>
    -- or whatever it was -- and damn<br>
    all. Did you think about me at<br>
    all?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I got enough of the dosage for<br>
    both of us....</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    But you never asked if I wanted<br>
    it. It's just like you, Mark,<br>
    to assume that what you felt was<br>
    right was the only answer.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It was the right answer for me.<br>
    It was killing you, having to take<br>
    care of an invalid. What good<br>
    was I to you? Annie -- we can<br>
    be together again....</p>
  <p> He takes her in his arms, tries to kiss her<br>
    passionately. She exerts a strong, angry effort and<br>
    pushes him away.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Let me go!</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I can get another supply of the<br>
    drug for you --</p>
  <p> Anne SOBS IN ANGER -- he just doesn't get it -- and she<br>
    runs into the bedroom. The door slides closed behind<br>
    her. Jameson is angry at her behavior. He slaps his<br>
    open palm on a piece of nearby furniture, heads rapidly<br>
    for the door.</p>
  <p>54 INT. CONFERENCE LOUNGE - ANGLE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He is seated at the table in front of a small Viewer.<br>
    There is no one else in the room. The lights are<br>
    DIMMED DOWN, and Jameson's face is largely in shadow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 28.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Commander Data, I wish to open<br>
    a communication frequency to<br>
    Karnas.</p>
  <p>55 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> Picard sits up straight as:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A moment, Mister Data. Admiral,<br>
    this is Picard. May I know the<br>
    purpose of this communication?</p>
  <p>56 INT. CONFERENCE LOUNGE - ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Karnas must have tried to<br>
    negotiate with the terrorists<br>
    before he was forced to call on<br>
    me. I want all the information<br>
    he has access to.</p>
  <p>57 INTERCUT BETWEEN PICARD ON BRIDGE AND JAMESON AS<br>
    NEEDED</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said he was a proud man...<br>
    probably sensitive about his<br>
    failure to deal with the<br>
    situation. Is it wise to press<br>
    him on this?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm the negotiator, Picard.<br>
    Karnas will have to cooperate<br>
    with me and the terrorists, and<br>
    damn his sensitivities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I suggest a secured channel,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (beat, then:)<br>
    A sensible precaution, Picard.<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to Data, who tabs his console as:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir. Frequency open and<br>
    secured.</p>
  <p>58 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> NOTE: The LIGHTS in the room REMAIN DIM; Jameson is<br>
    careful to remain back away from the light, so his face<br>
    is in shadow and cannot be clearly seen.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (to Viewer)<br>
    Karnas.</p>
  <p>59 ANGLE ON VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WE SEE Karnas, again in his office. His attitude is<br>
    firm, formal, but with a touch of belligerence.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    What is it you want, Admiral?</p>
  <p>60 INTERCUT CLOSE ON JAMESON AND KARNAS ON VIEWER AS<br>
    NEEDED. (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    We're on a secured channel,<br>
    Karnas. You can talk freely.<br>
    Who's behind this thing? You said<br>
    dissidents.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    Yes... political opponents who feel<br>
    the Federation will disavow me<br>
    as governor if they stir up enough<br>
    trouble on Mordan.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Then who is it? Ardan? Gilnor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 30.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    They're dead, Jameson. A long<br>
    time now. For a long time I<br>
    thought you were dead, too.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I almost died a couple of times<br>
    on missions, but I always made<br>
    it through somehow.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (coldly)<br>
    Yes. Now you're coming back to<br>
    Mordan -- to negotiate for<br>
    hostages again. It's almost as<br>
    though the forty-five years<br>
    between never happened....</p>
  <p> Jameson stiffens and stares at the image on the viewer,<br>
    suddenly realizing what this is about.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    You've never forgiven me.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Should I have -- after the legacy<br>
    of war you left us in your last<br>
    &quot;negotiation?&quot;</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    There are no dissidents, are<br>
    there? No terrorists. You have<br>
    the hostages.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    And if I have? You're coming to<br>
    Mordan, Jameson. You're going<br>
    to negotiate for their lives, and<br>
    I'm going to ask a very high price<br>
    for them.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    What if I refuse?</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Then the hostages will die.<br>
    You've seen how my executioners<br>
    work. They are still as efficient<br>
    as they were... perhaps even more<br>
    skilled now. You'll come -- even<br>
    if you don't have much honor left.<br>
    Karnas out.</p>
  <p> The Viewer GOES BLANK.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 31.</p>
  <p>61 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> angry, determined now on a course of action.</p>
  <p>62 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling as before at high warp speed.</p>
  <p>63 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> All personnel in their accustomed stations. Jameson<br>
    ENTERS from the Conference Lounge doors, CROSSING to<br>
    Picard as:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Are we still on schedule to arrive<br>
    at Mordan in thirty-eight hours?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. We're at warp four now.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Picard, I want a jump to warp eight<br>
    so we arrive ahead of our announced<br>
    ETA. It'll throw Karnas off balance,<br>
    and we can catch him before he's<br>
    ready.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready for exactly what, Admiral?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I believe Karnas is planning<br>
    something new... something that<br>
    will directly endanger the<br>
    hostages' lives.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened in your<br>
    communication to bring you to that<br>
    conclusion? It seems a big<br>
    jump....</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm not at liberty to say, Picard,<br>
    but negotiation is not the answer<br>
    or the issue here. The hostages'<br>
    lives are at stake.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT TWO 32.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I agree the most important thing<br>
    is saving the lives of the<br>
    hostages...</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    And you agree with that, too,<br>
    Riker?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I do, sir.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Good. Because I plan to<br>
    personally lead an away team on<br>
    an armed rescue mission to get<br>
    them out of there.</p>
  <p> On Picard and Riker's stunned shock and surprise:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>64 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is traveling at warp speed against a<br>
    background of streaking stars.</p>
  <p>65 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> Gathered in the Command area are Picard, Riker, Tasha,<br>
    Worf, Troi. Jameson presides from the Command Chair.<br>
    Data and Geordi are at their stations.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Commander Data, will you bring<br>
    up the plans I requested on the<br>
    Viewscreen, please.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> He begins to work his console. As Data activates the<br>
    Main Viewscreen, Jameson leans forward.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Most of Mordan's principal city<br>
    was devastated in the war. What<br>
    was left consisted of a network<br>
    of underground tunnels -- a rat's<br>
    maze. When they rebuilt the city,<br>
    they simply built over the<br>
    tunnels.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have it, sir.</p>
  <p>66 CLOSE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jameson was right. The GRAPHIC seen on the screen<br>
    depicts what looks like a complicated crochet-work<br>
    doily, every line indicating a tunnel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>67 BACK TO WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral, even if you're right<br>
    about Karnas being behind this,<br>
    he still wants to negotiate. Or<br>
    at least to talk. Why not hear<br>
    what he has to say?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I've heard what he has to say,<br>
    and I have good reason to believe<br>
    he's lying.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Pardon me, sir, but where do these<br>
    come into the picture?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    This is where Karnas held his<br>
    hostages before and where I<br>
    believe he has them now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wouldn't that be a little too<br>
    obvious, Admiral?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Karnas is a dogged strategist,<br>
    Picard -- not a brilliant one.<br>
    He sticks to what works.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An overt rescue attempt could push<br>
    Karnas into killing the hostages<br>
    outright.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I don't think that's what he<br>
    wants, Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what does he want?</p>
  <p> Troi studies Jameson closely, reacting with a slight<br>
    frown to his remarks.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Maybe his threats are just a way<br>
    to bargain for what he wants....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Karnas means exactly what he<br>
    says, Lieutenant. He will kill<br>
    the hostages if we don't get them<br>
    out of there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Therefore you see an armed raid<br>
    as our only option.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    You don't agree.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would point out no one else has<br>
    heard or considered Karnas's<br>
    demands but you, Admiral. The<br>
    Federation might take a different<br>
    view of them if they knew what<br>
    they were.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Starfleet gave me command of the<br>
    away team, Picard. I intend to<br>
    use them as I see fit.</p>
  <p>68 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD, TROI, BEVERLY</p>
  <p> They are gathered around Picard's desk as WE COME IN:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is Jameson physically able to lead<br>
    an away mission, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His cells, his tissue, even his<br>
    bones are still de-aging, but I'd<br>
    say he was. Generally, I'd call<br>
    Admiral Jameson a healthy<br>
    man... about forty-five... in<br>
    excellent physical condition.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about his mind?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The same. Brain scan reveals all<br>
    cells and tissue are changing,<br>
    but healthy. No loss of<br>
    memory... exellent grasp of facts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Certainly his physical capacities<br>
    have been restored. I sense that<br>
    gives him great satisfaction.<br>
    When he came aboard, he seemed<br>
    hopeful, eager. Now there seems<br>
    to be a harder, more forceful<br>
    attitude... ambition....</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    More of a young man's attitude,<br>
    I'd say. Aggressive... going right<br>
    for the throat of a situation<br>
    instead of considering the<br>
    alternatives.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Part of that is ambition too.<br>
    He wants to be the man he once<br>
    was. He is the man he once was,<br>
    but sometimes old memories aren't<br>
    very accurate. He was able to<br>
    lead away teams like this once.<br>
    Now he believes he can do it<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> As Beverly mulls over the implications of that one:</p>
  <p>69 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - BEVERLY, TROI, ANNE</p>
  <p> Anne is miserable, carrying the signs of her anguish on<br>
    her face.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Our anniversary is next week.<br>
    Fifty years....</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In his heart, he's still the same<br>
    man you married, Anne.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's true. He still cares for<br>
    you, despite the physical changes<br>
    he's undergoing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (confused, anguished)<br>
    But he's getting younger, and I'm<br>
    -- well, look at me. Why did he<br>
    do this... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There are lives at stake, Mrs.<br>
    Jameson.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    What about our lives? Mine and<br>
    his, together?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (takes Anne's hand)<br>
    Anne... I think I know a little<br>
    of what you're feeling. My<br>
    husband died on an away mission.<br>
    We'd been married two years. So<br>
    little time. Look at what you've<br>
    had with Mark --</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Years, yes -- but not together.<br>
    I was looking forward to time<br>
    together finally -- our<br>
    retirement. Now he's young again<br>
    and has a life to live over.</p>
  <p> Troi and Beverly exchange a worried glance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She has to know, Doctor.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Know what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Anne... he's --</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's not stabilizing.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    He may not have that life to live<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> Anne looks at her in anguish and despair as we go to:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>70 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as before, traveling at high warp speed.</p>
  <p>71 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard ENTERS. It's dimly lit, indicating it's late<br>
    -- ship's time. Picard makes his way toward a<br>
    comfortable chair, then:</p>
  <p> JAMESON (O.S.)<br>
    We'll be at Mordan in three hours.</p>
  <p>72 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING JAMESON</p>
  <p> He is seated further back from the windows, a drink of<br>
    some kind in his hand. Picard changes direction and<br>
    joins him as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I couldn't sleep either.</p>
  <p> Jameson indicates the glass in his hand... an offer.<br>
    Picard shakes his head and sits down opposite him. We<br>
    can see in this closer look at Jameson that he looks<br>
    younger still -- mid-thirties, perhaps.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I never could before a mission.<br>
    Always wound up in the Observation<br>
    Lounge, staring out at the stars.<br>
    Thinking.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe in this case rethinking?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Perceptive. They always have<br>
    given you high marks for that at<br>
    Starfleet, Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shrugs it away, then:)<br>
    Why is this mission so important<br>
    to you? Why did you risk your<br>
    life so you could lead it<br>
    personally?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I want to save lives, Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Noble sentiment -- but too easy<br>
    an answer. You've been here<br>
    before. You negotiated a release<br>
    of hostages with Karnas before.<br>
    Why is it now your answer is an<br>
    armed raid?</p>
  <p> Jameson is silent, staring into his glass.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's my away team you're going<br>
    to send in. There's something<br>
    you're not telling me, and I have<br>
    a right to know what it is.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (grunts)<br>
    Do you know the background? The<br>
    Mordanites had some<br>
    sophistication, but were still<br>
    ruled by tribal family units.<br>
    Karnas's father was the ruling<br>
    chief of one of the families, and<br>
    another tribe had him<br>
    assassinated. Karnas seized the<br>
    passengers of a starliner and<br>
    held them hostage, demanding that<br>
    Starfleet provide him with weapons<br>
    that would enable him to defeat<br>
    his rivals.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's the official record.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Officially the story is that after<br>
    two other mediators were<br>
    murdered, I went in and negotiated<br>
    with Karnas to bring out the<br>
    hostages safely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying that's not the<br>
    truth?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    It wasn't my golden oratory that<br>
    saved them, Picard. I gave Karnas<br>
    the weapons he wanted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT THREE 40.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You did what?</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I gave exactly the same weapons<br>
    to his rivals. My interpretation<br>
    of the Prime Directive. Let them<br>
    solve their problems with those<br>
    arms on an equal basis.</p>
  <p> Picard is staring at him with disbelief and disgust.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That decision plunged them into<br>
    forty years of civil war.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I didn't know that would happen.<br>
    I thought, a minor war -- it'll<br>
    be settled in less than a year.<br>
    How could I know it would be four<br>
    decades? I falsified the reports<br>
    to Starfleet, but I've lived with<br>
    that on my soul, Picard.<br>
    Sixty-three people came away safe<br>
    -- but millions died on Mordan<br>
    because I delivered those weapons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Karnas could have worked for peace<br>
    all those years instead of<br>
    continuing the war. It's not all<br>
    on your head, Admiral.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    But I started it. I lit the<br>
    match. Now, finally, I can<br>
    vindicate myself, if only in a<br>
    small way. I came to negotiate,<br>
    but that isn't what Karnas wants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Revenge. That's why he demanded<br>
    you when he found out you were<br>
    still alive.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I'm not going to give it to him,<br>
    Picard. I'm going to do what I<br>
    should have done the first time.<br>
    We're taking the hostages out<br>
    by force. No deals.</p>

  <p>73 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT AROUND MORDAN IV<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Mordan is not a very promising looking planet. In<br>
    fact, it's a mud-brown ball with some hints of blue and<br>
    green. The Enterprise is in standard orbit.</p>
  <p>74 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Jameson is standing, facing Picard and Riker. Already<br>
    on the pad are Tasha, Worf, Data, Geordi. All are<br>
    equipped with phasers. Data and Tasha also have<br>
    tricorders. Jameson steps up on the pad.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Prepare to energize, Chief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Belay that.</p>
  <p> The chief looks helplessly from one officer to the<br>
    other. Who's he supposed to obey?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Admiral, the correct place for<br>
    you is on the bridge...</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    I will remind you one more time,<br>
    Picard, I am the Senior Mission<br>
    Commander, and I'm leading this<br>
    team.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for just a beat, then steps up on the<br>
    platform himself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Admiral is correct, Number<br>
    One. He has that right. But I'm<br>
    the captain of this ship, and I<br>
    have it, too. You have command<br>
    of the Enterprise, Commander<br>
    Riker.<br>
    (to the Chief)<br>
    Energize.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>75 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT AROUND MORDAN<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as before, the Enterprise holding standard orbit around<br>
    the planet.</p>
  <p>76 INT. TUNNEL - DAY - ANGLE ON AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> as they MATERIALIZE IN THE TRANSPORTER EFFECT. As soon<br>
    as the TRANSPORTER EFFECT FADES, the Team is<br>
    immediately busy, checking phasers, Data taking<br>
    tricorder readings. Jameson looks around, seems to<br>
    recognize where he is. The tunnel itself is old, seems<br>
    unmaintained.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Yes...perfect. We are in the M-4<br>
    tunnel directly under the<br>
    governor's residence. M-4 is a<br>
    subsidiary tunnel, but it crosses<br>
    and links with several main ones.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry, sir. That does not<br>
    correspond with the information<br>
    I have on the tricorder, sir.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Your information is incorrect,<br>
    Commander. I know these tunnels<br>
    like the back of my own hand.<br>
    (gestures off)<br>
    That way. It takes us to the<br>
    hatch that will let us into M-1<br>
    tunnel. Keep scanning for signs<br>
    of human life forms. Karnas held<br>
    his hostages in these tunnels<br>
    before. He'll do it again.</p>
  <p> Jameson STARTS OFF down the tunnel. The others FOLLOW,<br>
    staying alert.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>77 CLOSER - PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> Data drops in beside Picard, staring at the tricorder<br>
    screen in bewilderment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The admiral is definitely<br>
    incorrect, Captain. The tunnel<br>
    schematics we have indicate this<br>
    is a dead end. It was sealed off<br>
    two years ago....</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've no doubt you're right, Mister<br>
    Data. However, forty-five years<br>
    ago, I'm sure it linked in with<br>
    the tunnels Admiral Jameson<br>
    remembers.</p>
  <p>78 INT. TUNNEL #2 - DAY - ANGLE ON THE TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They round a corner -- and see the way has been blocked<br>
    off. There was a hatch of some kind, but this has been<br>
    cemented over. Geordi scans it with his VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Steelplast. Fairly recent<br>
    installation.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Damn. This is the most direct<br>
    route. Set phasers to cut through<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Worf and Tasha adjust their phasers and FIRE at the<br>
    blocked area.</p>
  <p>79 ANGLE AT BLOCKED AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two PHASER BEAMS slash in and cut a rough square in<br>
    the blocked area.</p>
  <p>80 BACK TO WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    If you have the coordinates for<br>
    where you think the hostages are,<br>
    sir, we could just beam in there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    But Karnas might not have them<br>
    in the same place. There is no<br>
    substitute for a personal<br>
    reconnoiter, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> She glances at Picard, decides not to say anything<br>
    else. With Jameson leading, they step through the hole<br>
    into another tunnel.</p>
  <p>81 INT. TUNNEL #3 - ON THE AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> The team moves along this tunnel, toward an<br>
    intersection ahead. There is some debris in the way,<br>
    as though part of the tunnel had given way at one time<br>
    and has been shored up. Geordi is still scanning with<br>
    his VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Admiral, there's an infrared light<br>
    signal ahead. Steady beam,<br>
    straight across the tunnel, chest<br>
    high. Another at hip level.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    An alarm trigger or --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reset phasers to stun.</p>
  <p> Jameson steps forward, and:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Look out, sir!</p>
  <p>82 ANOTHER ANGLE - AT INTERSECTION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ahead of them, a SQUAD OF MORDANITE SOLDIERS has come<br>
    around the corner of the intersection, armed and ready<br>
    for action. Our team brings phasers up, but the<br>
    Mordanites FIRE FIRST. Tasha moves herself in front of<br>
    Picard, but he pulls her down flat behind the tunnel<br>
    debris as PHASER-LIKE FIRE zips over their heads. The<br>
    SOUND OF THE FIRE is different, flat and humming.<br>
    Tasha begins to FIRE back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf, in the meantime, has bodily picked up Jameson<br>
    and moved him aside, against the wall, using his own<br>
    big body as a shield for the Admiral. Data ducks down<br>
    beside Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Their phasers, sir -- set on<br>
    kill.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (drily)<br>
    Thank you, Mister Data. I have<br>
    heard the sound before.</p>
  <p>83 ANGLE ON JAMESON AND WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jameson has unhitched his phaser and is firing quickly<br>
    down the tunnel toward the Mordanites. Worf's fire is<br>
    steady, methodical. Several Mordanites fall stunned as<br>
    a result of our people's fire. Jameson moves away from<br>
    the wall and the cover of Worf's body and tries to<br>
    charge down the tunnel toward the soldiers, who are<br>
    offering up a steady fire.</p>
  <p>84 WIDER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard reaches out to try to stop Jameson, but the<br>
    Admiral suddenly crumples, almost into Data's arms.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Is he hit?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (trying to examine him)<br>
    I cannot tell --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (tabs communicator)<br>
    Enterprise, this is Picard. Five<br>
    to beam up -- now!</p>
  <p> The five of them cluster together. MORDANITE FIRE is<br>
    still steady as the soldiers begin to advance toward<br>
    them. Tasha and Worf maintain a steady covering fire<br>
    that slows them down. Then the TRANSPORTER EFFECT<br>
    BEGINS TO BUILD AND COVER OUR PEOPLE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>85 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM</p>
  <p> as the team IS MATERIALIZED. As soon as the EFFECT<br>
    STOPS, Picard bends down to where Data, supporting<br>
    Jameson, is lowering him to the platform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How badly is he hurt?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not see any sign of a wound,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p>86 CLOSER ON THE GROUP</p>
  <p> WE DO NOT SEE Jameson's face, which is turned AWAY FROM<br>
    CAMERA. He is doubled over, shaking violently as<br>
    though palsied. Data looks up at Picard, frowning.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be another attack,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Call Doctor Crusher here<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir.<br>
    (goes to transporter<br>
    console)<br>
    Transporter Room Three to Sickbay.<br>
    Doctor Crusher, please report<br>
    immediately with Medical Support<br>
    Team.</p>
  <p>87 ANGLE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> WE DO NOT SEE his face. He CRIES OUT in agony, and<br>
    writhes painfully.</p>
  <p>88 OMITTED</p>
  <p>89 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> He is lying on one of the examination beds, face<br>
    turned AWAY FROM CAMERA, still shaking in pain. Troi<br>
    is standing by with Anne as a medtech monitors him<br>
    closely.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>90 INT. CRUSHER'S OFFICE - PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This last attack is the worst one<br>
    he's suffered, sir. The others<br>
    were overwith fairly quickly.<br>
    He hasn't recovered from this one<br>
    yet, and nothing has been able<br>
    to relieve his pain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any answers, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid none of it is very<br>
    hopeful. The compound he took<br>
    seems to be rejuvenating the DNA,<br>
    but it's also sloughing off the<br>
    old cells too fast for his body<br>
    to cope. His body is trying to<br>
    grow and die and regenerate all<br>
    at the same time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    You're saying the overdose of<br>
    the drug he took is working too<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exactly, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When will it stop?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It won't... because it can't.<br>
    Eventually, he won't be able to<br>
    stand the strain.</p>
  <p>91 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> ENTERING from the aft turbolift. Riker comes out of<br>
    the Command Chair toward him. NOTE: Data, Worf and<br>
    Tasha are now back at their regular stations. Troi is<br>
    not on the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The admiral... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sickbay. &quot;Not good&quot; is a galactic<br>
    understatement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Karnas again, sir. On the screen.</p>
  <p> He actives his console.</p>
  <p>92 ANGLE ON PICARD INCLUDING MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Karnas's image APPEARS ON SCREEN in the same setting as<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Enterprise. There has been an<br>
    armed intrusion in the tunnels<br>
    beneath the city. That smells<br>
    of Jameson. Where is he?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Picard. I am sorry to<br>
    inform you that the admiral is<br>
    critically ill, Karnas.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (coming out of the<br>
    chair)<br>
    That is not my concern. Sick or<br>
    well, you have ten minutes to beam<br>
    him down, Captain Picard.<br>
    Otherwise, the hostages die.</p>
  <p> The VIEWSCREEN GOES BLANK. Then:</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI'S COM VOICE<br>

  <p> Picard exchanges a worried look with Riker, then:</p>

    On my way.</p>
  <p> As he HURRIES for the turbolift:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>93 INT. SICKBAY - ANGLE AT DOOR</p>
  <p> as Picard ENTERS. Beverly meets him, her face grim.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You'd better see for yourself.</p>
  <p>94 ANGLE AT JAMESON'S BED</p>
  <p> Troi is trying to comfort Anne, who huddles at the side<br>
    of the bed in utter despair. Picard approaches, looks<br>
    down at the body there -- and his jaw drops.</p>
  <p>95 CLOSE ON JAMESON</p>
  <p> The eyes are alive and intelligent -- but the face and<br>
    body Picard sees are those of a teen-aged boy. NOTE:<br>
    Jameson's VOICE remains the same as before.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Picard....</p>

    Picard, I have to get to Karnas.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't allow him out of my care,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    My last option, Picard. The raid<br>
    failed... all I have left to<br>

  <p>97 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON RIKER</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A new demand from Karnas, sir.<br>
    If we don't deliver Jameson in<br>
    five minutes, a hostage will be<br>
    executed. Fifteen minutes after<br>
    that, another.</p>
  <p>98 INT. SICKBAY - ON PICARD, BEVERLY, JAMESON</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    He promises the method of<br>
    execution will be both slow and<br>
    painful.</p>
  <p> A beat, as Picard looks from Beverly to Jameson.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    Let me go. If I turn myself over<br>
    to him, he'll let the hostages<br>
    go. It's me he wants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's certain death for you,<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    My life for how many hostages,<br>
    Picard? Twenty?<br>
    (hard)<br>
    Let me go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat, then:)<br>
    Number One, inform Karnas we'll<br>

    Aye, sir. Riker out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>99 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON PLATFORM</p>
  <p> as Picard, Beverly (with medical kit) and the boy<br>
    Jameson are mounting the platform. Jameson's uniform,<br>
    while still that of an admiral, hangs loosely on him.<br>
    Riker ENTERS, moves toward them as:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, you can't go down there<br>
    again --<br>
    (stops, staring at the<br>
    boy)<br>
    Jameson... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Exactly why I have to go,<br>
    Will. As a Starfleet captain,<br>
    I have negotiating powers.<br>
    (to Transporter Chief)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief works his console. The<br>
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT BEGINS TO BUILD and cover the<br>
    figures of Picard, Beverly and the boy Jameson.</p>
  <p>100 INT. KARNAS'S OFFICE - DAY</p>
  <p> The TRANSPORTER EFFECT MATERIALIZES the three figures<br>
    directly in front of Karnas's desk. Karnas is waiting,<br>
    puzzled to see three. There are several Mordanite<br>
    soldiers in the room, but it will be noticed they are<br>
    old soldiers -- veterans in their late fifties and<br>
    sixties.</p>
  <p> Karnas gets to his feet as THE MATERIALIZATION EFFECT<br>
    FADES, and he sees Picard, Beverly and the boy Jameson.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    Who are you! I want Jameson!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Admiral Mark Jameson.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>101 INT. KARNAS'S OFFICE - DAY - PICARD, JAMESON (BOY)</p>
  <p> as we left them. Karnas stares at the boy in the<br>
    Starfleet uniform, dismisses him with a grunt, and<br>
    turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    This charade will accomplish<br>
    nothing, Picard. Beam Jameson<br>
    down, and the hostages will be<br>
    freed. Continue this -- and I<br>
    promise you they will die -- and<br>
    you with them.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Karnas, if you'll just listen....</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Why have you brought him here?<br>
    This is no place for children.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Peretor Karnas. You always were<br>
    a stubborn man. I thought you<br>
    wanted me. I'm here. Release<br>
    the hostages. now.</p>
  <p> Karnas stares at him, startled for a moment, then:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    &quot;Peretor&quot; was my old title. Why<br>
    do you call me that?</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Because you're acting like the<br>
    warrior you were -- not like the<br>
    planetary governor you are.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Picard, I warn you, this trick<br>
    is going too far. He has been<br>
    coached... for some devious<br>
    reason. If this farce is not<br>
    stopped immediately, you and the<br>
    hostages will be put to death.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>101 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly Jameson doubles over, the intense pain driving<br>
    him to his knees. Beverly rushes to him as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral!</p>
  <p> Beverly is checking him, frowning. She administers a<br>
    hypospray, which seems to ease him a bit.</p>
  <p>102 ANGLE ON KARNAS AND PICARD</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    I'm waiting for an explanation,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is the admiral. Before we left<br>
    on this mission, he administered<br>
    an overdose of an alien de-aging<br>
    drug to himself. He wanted to<br>
    face you with strength again... on<br>
    even terms. This is what the drug<br>
    has done to him.</p>
  <p>103 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BEVERLY AND JAMESON</p>
  <p> Beverly has helped Jameson to a chair. He seems to be<br>
    weak, almost frail. Karnas paces in front of the desk,<br>
    railing at Picard.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    This story you are telling is<br>
    unbelievable. Jameson is a man<br>
    of eighty, not --<br>
    (points to Jameson)<br>
    -- this. I want that old man,<br>
    Picard. I want to show him this<br>
    world he helped to make... the<br>
    scars on old soldiers' bodies...<br>
    the graveyards of our young<br>
    dead... the wasted cities we are<br>
    still rebuilding... and all of<br>
    it caused by him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As I understand the facts, Karnas,<br>
    you were the one who demanded<br>
    weapons to avenge your father's<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    But Jameson didn't give weapons<br>
    only to us. If he had, we would<br>
    have triumphed over our enemies<br>
    in less than a year, and we would<br>
    have had peace in all these<br>
    decades. When Jameson gave<br>
    weapons to both sides, he gave<br>
    us forty years of war. I want<br>
    him to pay for that, Picard.</p>
  <p> Jameson is hit by another viciously painful attack,<br>
    GASPS AND MOANS in pain. Beverly takes a quick reading<br>
    on her instruments, looks over at Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sir, I think Mrs. Jameson should<br>
    beam down. Now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods quickly)<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> As Beverly touches her communicator:</p>
  <p>104 ANGLE ON PICARD AND KARNAS</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Karnas, I've asked Doctor Crusher<br>
    to bring down the visual records<br>
    we've made of Admiral Jameson's<br>
    deterioration. Will you look at<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    You're wasting my time, Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Only a few moments.</p>
  <p> When Karnas does not reply immediately, Picard nods to<br>
    Beverly, who hands her medical P.A.D.D. to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You saw Admiral Jameson when he<br>
    was on board en route to Mordan?</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>104 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You recognized him?</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Picard holds out the medical P.A.D.D. for him to see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And this is the man you saw.</p>
  <p>105 CLOSE ON P.A.D.D. SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The screen shows Jameson as he was at the beginning, in<br>
    the physical support chair.</p>
  <p> KARNAS (V.O.)<br>
    Yes. This is the man I want.</p>
  <p>106 WIDER ANGLE - PICARD AND KARNAS</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Never again, Karnas.</p>
  <p> He holds out the tricorder again. Karnas reluctantly<br>
    looks.</p>
  <p>107 CLOSE ON TRICORDER SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Still shots APPEAR in sequence -- Jameson as he began<br>
    to de-age, as he became younger and younger.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Once he took the compound ... there<br>
    was no way to stop it.</p>
  <p> The final picture is the boy Jameson.</p>
  <p>108 WIDER - EMPHASIZING KARNAS, PICARD</p>
  <p> Karnas stares across the room at Jameson, who is being<br>
    tended by Beverly. The boy has begun to shake. Not<br>
    pain, but a quivering in the body that cannot be<br>
    stopped.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>108 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THE SOUND OF THE TRANSPORTER BEGINS, and ANNE<br>
    MATERIALIZES IN THE ROOM. She looks around, sees<br>
    Jameson's terrible condition and quickly goes to him.<br>
    She sits beside him, takes his hand, but he is paying<br>
    no attention to her. His eyes are on Karnas.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll have to deal with me,<br>
    Karnas. Whatever you wanted from<br>
    Jameson isn't possible any more.</p>
  <p> Karnas leans against his desk, stares around at the old<br>
    soldiers who had come to share his moment of triumph<br>
    over their legendary enemy. None of them know what<br>
    to think, but Karnas clearly is still not convinced.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You wanted revenge, Karnas. You<br>
    blamed your war on Jameson, and<br>
    there's no doubt he had a lot to<br>
    do with it. But you had the<br>
    weapons, and you used them. You<br>
    could have tried for negotiations<br>
    for peace on your planet long ago.<br>
    You chose to fight instead. How<br>
    many of those forty years of war<br>
    are on your head?</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Jameson has to pay for his<br>
    crimes... I have sworn it to my<br>
    people. When I found out he was<br>
    alive, I gave them my word I would<br>
    kill him for what he did. A public<br>
    execution... public retribution<br>
    for what he did to us.</p>
  <p> Picard realizes he may be talking to a wall. But one<br>
    more time:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (points to the boy)<br>
    Then there's Jameson. He wanted<br>
    to atone for what he'd done here.<br>
    Forty-five years ago, he made the<br>
    wrong decision, and he wanted to<br>
    come here to somehow right it.<br>
    He wanted to negotiate, and when<br>
    that failed, he decided to fight.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>108 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Your men foiled that, and all he<br>
    has left now is to give himself<br>
    up to you. He's brought this<br>
    retribution on himself.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    No. I don't believe you. You<br>
    are shielding Jameson on the ship<br>
    and telling me this tale to save<br>
    his life.</p>
  <p>109 ANGLE ON JAMESON (BOY)</p>
  <p> He is still shuddering, gets to his feet. Anne tries<br>
    to hold his hand, but he pulls away from her. Beverly<br>
    signals to her to let him go, but she keeps a close eye<br>
    on him herself.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Peretor Karnas... there were only<br>
    two of us in the meeting. You<br>
    didn't even trust your lieutenants<br>
    then. You told me old Peretor<br>
    Sain had ordered your father's<br>
    assassination. You told me you<br>
    wanted arms to destroy him. Peace<br>
    wasn't on your mind. You just<br>
    wanted revenge. And I gave you<br>
    the weapons to do it.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Jameson told you all this.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    I am Jameson. Do you want a list<br>
    of the weapons I gave you? Only<br>
    you and I would know what it was,<br>
    because I erased every trace of<br>
    them from the records.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Jameson still could have told you<br>
    this.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you are him, show me the scar.</p>
  <p> JAMESON<br>
    (rolls up sleeve)<br>
    There. The blood cut you gave<br>
    me to seal our bargain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>109 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He holds out his arm, and Karnas stares at him.</p>
  <p>110 CLOSE ON JAMESON'S (BOY'S) ARM</p>
  <p> A curious V-shaped scar arcs across the wrist, almost<br>
    like a chevron.</p>
  <p>111 ANGLE ON KARNAS AND JAMESON</p>
  <p> Karnas looks up at Jameson... and he finally believes.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    It is you. Somehow... it is you.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Karnas twists away, reaches for the wall<br>
    behind his desk and the weapons there. He grabs one<br>
    of the phasers and raises it, aiming it at Jameson's<br>
    heart.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Then die by one of your own<br>
    weapons!</p>
  <p> Everyone else is frozen by the moment. The boy/man<br>
    simply stands there, still shuddering from the terrible<br>
    changes going on in his body, but not afraid. Slowly,<br>
    Karnas lowers the weapon.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No. My revenge is in letting<br>
    you live like this.</p>
  <p>112 EMPHASIZING JAMESON (BOY)</p>
  <p> He holds for a long beat, and then he crumples to the<br>
    floor with a CRY of agony. Beverly and Anne go to him<br>
    immediately, Beverly running a quick scan with her<br>
    instruments.</p>
  <p>113 PICARD AND KARNAS</p>
  <p> as Karnas moves forward, laying the weapon down on his<br>
    desk. Jameson CRIES OUT AGAIN, in terrible pain.</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Such pain....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>113 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher?</p>
  <p>114 ANGLE ON BEVERLY, JAMESON (BOY), ANNE</p>
  <p> Beverly looks up, shakes her head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His body can't rejuvenate any<br>
    further. The compound he took<br>
    is trying to force the organs and<br>
    tissue to go further, younger,<br>
    and they can't take the stress.<br>
    It's like he's -- imploding. I<br>
    can't do anything to stop it, sir.</p>
  <p> Jameson CRIES OUT AGAIN.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you give him something for<br>
    the pain?</p>
  <p> Slowly, sadly, Beverly shakes her head.</p>
  <p>115 CLOSE ON JAMESON (BOY) AND ANNE</p>
  <p> Quietly, she moves in beside Beverly, who pulls back<br>
    out of the way. Anne takes the boy's head in her arms,<br>
    cradles him against her. No matter that this is just a<br>
    young teenager now -- this is still the man she loved<br>
    for fifty years.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    Mark... can you hear me?</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    I'll always love you.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    Annie with the golden hair....</p>
  <p> ANNE<br>
    (forces a smile)<br>
    Flatterer. It's grey now.</p>
  <p> JAMESON (BOY)<br>
    I only see the gold....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>115 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He convulses in a wave of fierce pain, and she holds on<br>
    to him tight. Then as it seems to pass, and he looks<br>
    up at her:</p>
  <p>116 CLOSE ON JAMESON'S EYES</p>
  <p> They are old eyes, filled with the memories of eighty<br>
    years. And then they close for the last time.</p>
  <p>117 WIDER - EMPHASIZING ANNE, JAMESON (BOY), KARNAS</p>
  <p> As the others look on, Anne begins quietly to weep.<br>
    Karnas moves closer, staring down at the strange body<br>
    of his old enemy. Finally:</p>
  <p> KARNAS<br>
    Rest, Jameson. Your long night<br>
    -- and mine -- is over.<br>
    (up to Picard)<br>
    The hostages will be released<br>
    immediately, Captain. I am<br>
    prepared to be -- cooperative.</p>
  <p>118 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT AROUND MORDAN<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Enterprise in standard orbit.</p>
  <p>119 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA</p>
  <p> where Picard is completing the dictation of his log.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... The hostages have been freed<br>
    by Karnas, unharmed.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Personal note. The body of<br>
    Admiral Mark Jameson has been<br>
    buried on Mordan, at the request<br>
    of his widow and with the<br>
    permission of Karnas. Log out.</p>
  <p> Picard glances across to Riker, shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The quest for youth, Number One...<br>
    so futile. Age and wisdom have<br>
    their graces.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Too Short... &quot; - 10/6/87 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>119 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wonder if one doesn't have to<br>
    have age and wisdom to appreciate<br>
    that, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope not, Number One. It would<br>
    be such a waste of youth.<br>
    (beat, then:)<br>
    Mister La Forge, prepare to take us<br>
    out of orbit. Set course for Isis<br>
    III.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. Leaving orbit.</p>
  <p>120 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MORDAN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the sleek starship begins her pull away from the<br>
    planet and heads for the stars.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
