  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN PLANET ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A lovely blue and white planet, close to Earthlike in<br>
    appearance.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>

    necessities, we have discovered<br>
    another Class M planet in the<br>

  <p> PICARD, TROI, WORF and WESLEY on duty with replacement<br>

  <p>4 EMPHASIZING PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... a pastoral world, which also<br>
    shows evidence of learning and<br>
    civilization. My first officer<br>
    has taken an away team down to<br>
    make contact and they are in the<br>
    process of returning to the ship.</p>
  <p>5 COMMAND AND HELM AREAS</p>
  <p> Picard looking to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riker has sounded very enthused<br>
    in his reports.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    He says the planet has life forms<br>
    almost identical to us.</p>
  <p> Interrupted by Beverly who ENTERS, obviously with much<br>
    on her mind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain... !<br>
    (sees she has<br>
    interrupted)<br>
    Sorry, Troi.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles, beckons Beverly in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The Doctor has something much more<br>
    important on her mind, Captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (frowns; to Troi)<br>
    Please, Troi, do not pick up my<br>
    feelings!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your feelings? All we need<br>
    are ears.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles to Beverly)<br>
    You've been talking about it for<br>
    days now... Shore leave for the<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> Beverly sees that her son Wesley has also thrown her<br>
    a concerned look. She gives an apologetic nod to Troi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm tired myself.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Establishing that colony has<br>
    exhausted the entire crew, sir.<br>
    We're not a supply vessel.<br>
    Settling all those people was a<br>
    strain on everyone.</p>
  <p> RIKER interrupts by ENTERING with DATA, GEORDI, TASHA.<br>
    They all register enthusiasm, giving the replacement<br>
    crew nods, smiles, thumbs up gestures as they take over<br>
    their positions. Riker has continued straight to<br>
    Picard, acknowledging Troi and Beverly too.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it as good as your reports,<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (enthused)<br>
    Exactly per my reports, sir.<br>
    Class M, so Earthlike, so<br>
    beautiful, it will startle you!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It sounds wonderful for the<br>
    children!<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The Holodecks are marvelous, of<br>
    course, but nothing like giving<br>
    them open space and fresh air...</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a simulated deep breath of air.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I've listed my report on their<br>
    customs and laws, sir. Fairly<br>
    simple, common sense things.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wild in some ways, puritanical<br>
    in others. Neat as pins,<br>
    ultra-lawful, and making love at<br>
    the drop of a hat.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Any hat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smile)<br>
    But even the happiest report has<br>
    its negatives. Let's start with<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grins)<br>
    There are none, sir. Not that<br>
    any of us can find.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But there is a problem here, sir!</p>
  <p> Data is puzzling over readings at his station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I do not understand this at all!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It's the faulty reading I<br>
    reported, sir.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sensor technicians are working<br>
    on it, sir. They've identified<br>
    it as a &quot;glitch&quot; in the system.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I take it you find no &quot;glitch&quot;<br>
    at all in this planet, however.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    If you approve shore leave, sir,<br>
    we could start with a small group<br>
    at first.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course...<br>
    (turns)<br>
    Wesley, if we go, you will join<br>
    the away team to evaluate this<br>
    world as a place for young people<br>
    to relax.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir!</p>
  <p> He glances at Beverly to note her smiling approval of<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If all scans and observations<br>
    confirm the reports...<br>
    (nods)<br>
    ... certainly I'll approve it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's hope it is not too good<br>
    to be true.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN PLANET ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The same lovely planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    We are in orbit of a planet<br>
    designated Rubicun Three... and<br>
    have found it to be the home of<br>
    a life form who call themselves<br>
    the Edo.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SURFACE OF RUBICUN THREE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The planet is as described. We are at an inhabited<br>
    part of it... clean, neat, the &quot;streets&quot; appearing more<br>
    like a running track, bordered with flowers. The<br>
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT brings in our new away team of Riker,<br>
    Troi, Tasha, Worf and Wesley. In the near distance, a<br>
    group of very human appearing people have seen them<br>
    arriving and two of them turn and race in this direction.<br>
    Worf is quickly aware of it and prepares to interpose<br>
    himself protectively.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Careful, sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all right, Lieutenant, these<br>
    are the Edo we met.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON THE EDO</p>
  <p> ARRIVING at high speed. A young female and male who,<br>
    like other Edo we'll meet, are both tall, full haired,<br>
    with even white teeth, great bodies. They're also<br>
    dressed in loose, sexy clothing and these two wear a<br>
    silvery necklace indicating high rank. Riker is<br>
    watching an attractive Edo woman, saying:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They certainly are... fit, right?</p>
  <p> Troi is looking at an Edo male.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They certainly are.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Health and happiness!</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    A pleasant day to you!</p>
  <p> Troi gives Riker an even sharper second look as the Edo<br>
    ARRIVE and RIVAN, the woman, gives Riker a close and<br>
    rather intimate hands-on hug which, although it touches<br>
    upon the sensual, also combines genuine friendship, too.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    You did return as promised!</p>
  <p> The man, LIATOR, is looking over Troi and Tasha with<br>
    healthy interest. Like Rivan, although slim and very<br>
    well muscled, he has a quiet dignity that fits well with<br>
    this necklace-badge of leadership.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Rivan, Liator...<br>
    (indicating)<br>
    Also from our vessel is Troi...</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Slowly, slowly...<br>
    (embraces Troi)<br>
    I must also welcome this lovely<br>
    one...<br>
    (embracing Tasha)<br>
    ... and this lovely one...</p>
  <p> Riker waits, watching with interest until Tasha<br>
    disengages. She understands his look.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    My pleasure.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Healthy sensuality, sir. I feel<br>
    mainly happiness and friendship.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    And I welcome this huge one...<br>
    (hugs and fondles Worf)<br>
    ... oh, yes, yes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    Nice planet!</p>
  <p> Rivan moves to Wesley, stops quizzically.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    But you are a young one. I do<br>
    not know your custom regarding<br>
    love.</p>
  <p> Wesley is clearly nervous, although intrigued too. He<br>
    clears his throat:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh... I guess... whatever you<br>
    usually do...</p>
  <p> Rivan shows excellent taste, giving Wesley a &quot;hug&quot; but<br>
    without any &quot;extras.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Others would like to visit here<br>
    too. If you'll tell us what<br>
    limits you'd place on the<br>
    number...</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Whatever pleases you. We can<br>
    discuss it at the Council<br>
    Chambers.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Shall we go there now or remain<br>
    and play?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Play?</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    At love. Unless you don't enjoy<br>
    that.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Perhaps you do?</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    And you? Yes, I can see that you<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Listen, maybe I'll just go on<br>
    ahead...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (indicates Wesley)<br>
    This is unfair to him.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    We'll go to the Council Chambers.<br>
    You'll find young people your age<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (warily)<br>
    Well... I really can't make any<br>
    promises...</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    You don't have to. Our rules are<br>
    simple. No one does anything<br>
    uncomfortable to them.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Come! Our people will want to<br>
    know you.</p>
  <p> Then she turns back, glancing at the more formal<br>
    clothing worn by the humans.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Rivan, perhaps they...can't...run.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Can't run? Sure we can run, right<br>
    sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    That's the custom here, running...<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Right! Lead the way!</p>
  <p> Rivan, Liator, and Wesley LEAD OFF, the Others JOGGING<br>
    AFTER them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 TRUCKING - EMPHASIZING RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> who find themselves out in front of Tasha and Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;When in Rome... ,&quot; eh?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When where, sir?</p>
  <p> CAMERA HOLDS as the Group runs past.</p>
  <p>9A EXT. SECOND SCENIC LOCATION</p>
  <p> Rivan and Liator leading the Enterprise people along<br>
    another lovely pathway where an elderly but very trim<br>
    FIRST EDO CITIZEN and a pair of younger N.D. EDO<br>
    CITIZENS see them coming and break into a run to join<br>
    them. Lots of smiles and waves.</p>
  <p>9B TRUCKING - EMPHASIZING AWAY TEAM AND FIRST EDO CITIZZEN</p>
  <p> The Enterprise people very much taken with the joy and<br>
    good health they're seeing. First Edo citizen notes<br>
    Tasha's light complexion and amazon form.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO CITIZEN<br>
    Good health to you!</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Happiness to you!<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    It's like an &quot;Eden&quot; here.</p>
  <p>10 EXT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> A combination of conference and recreation facilities,<br>
    lots of light and air and spectacularly healthy looking<br>
    people in revealing but comfortable garb. SOUND of<br>
    delighted ADULT LAUGHTER from inside the chambers too.<br>
    Two adults and a child DEPART on the run, another older<br>
    woman ARRIVES -- on the run too. She doesn't seem to<br>
    be breathing very hard at all.</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE ON RIKER AND TEAM</p>
  <p> ARRIVING on the run with their Edo companions. They<br>
    haven't done too badly. Rivan stops, looks Riker and<br>
    the Enterprise people over, then moves in and embraces<br>
    Riker again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Good health! I thought you might<br>
    be out of breath.</p>
  <p> A SHRIEK from children at play, several Edo children<br>
    race INTO SIGHT.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Children, we've brought you a new<br>
    friend!</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    Hello! Join us!</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    Yes, please!</p>
  <p> Wesley joins the smiling children.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grins)<br>
    We may surprise you in a lot of<br>
    ways.</p>
  <p>12 INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly<br>
    formalized furnishing plan -- it includes just about<br>
    any way anyone would like to sit or loll. The same sort<br>
    of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along with<br>
    good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly present<br>
    here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink selections.<br>
    A MUSIC GROUP of Harpists in sight -- admittedly<br>
    strange looking harps on which they compose, and now<br>
    and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like everything else,<br>
    is not taken too seriously here either.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Everyone! We've brought the<br>
    visitors!</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (gesturing to away team)<br>
    Please enjoy what we have!</p>
  <p>13 EMPHASIZING ENTERPRISE PEOPLE</p>
  <p> as they are taken charge of with great hospitality.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN ORBIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The same lovely planet.</p>
  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as Data ENTERS bridge from the turbolift, strides<br>
    rapidly toward his station, his face reflecting concern.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have traced it through all sensor<br>
    channels, Captain! It is not a<br>
    glitch... !</p>
  <p> Picard becomes alarmed at Data's tone, follows him to<br>
    the Ops station where Data begins going over readings<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... or any other form of error or<br>
    malfunction, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Confirmed by my readings, sir.<br>
    It's like a &quot;shadow something&quot;...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly! As if it's not entirely<br>
    in or out of our dimension.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;What&quot; is, Commander?</p>
  <p> Data points off to front starboard of the vessel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Whatever is sitting out there<br>
    without triggering our alarm<br>
    relays, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Center Main Viewer on that area.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the IMAGE there shifts slightly, but REVEALS nothing<br>
    but the planet and star background previously seen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data; continuing)<br>
    I need more, Commander.</p>
  <p> Data seems stumped for a moment, then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Permission to go to hailing<br>
    frequencies, sir?</p>
  <p> A puzzled Picard nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open. On all<br>
    frequencies and language forms,<br>
    send...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Enterprise to Object off our<br>
    starboard bow. Request that you<br>
    identify yourself!</p>
  <p> As suddenly, the &quot;what&quot; begins appearing -- A HUGE AND<br>
    COMPLEX LOOKING OBJECT, A BIT SMALLER THAN THE<br>
    ENTERPRISE. IT IS HALF-TRANSPARENT BUT PARTLY SOLID,<br>
    TOO, AND VERY DEADLY LOOKING. A VESSEL? PERHAPS, BUT<br>
    SEEMINGLY MORE, TOO. WE WILL LEARN THAT IT SOMEHOW<br>
    EXISTS HERE AND IN ANOTHER CONTINUUM AT THE SAME TIME.<br>
    At the moment it appears, the Enterprise RED ALERT with<br>
    KLAXON comes on too.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY OBJECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The partially transparent Mystery Object as described,<br>
    positioned very close to the starship Enterprise. Its<br>
    very nearness implies threat.</p>
  <p>18 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Red Alert lights FLASHING, the KLAXON SOUNDING a<br>
    couple more times, then going SILENT. The mystery<br>
    object IMAGE is on the Main Viewer; Picard and the<br>
    others are as we last saw them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shields and deflectors up full,<br>
    sir. Main phaser banks ready.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hailing frequencies? Any reply?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    It was something unintelligible,<br>
    Captain. Now running it through<br>
    our logic and language circuits...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have a real look at it, Geordi!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (hurrying for the<br>
    turbolift)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir, my sensors read it... well,<br>
    as &quot;half there.&quot; And it does<br>
    look...</p>
  <p> She hesitates. Data finishes her thought.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As if it's partly...transparent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what the hell is it?</p>
  <p> It is rather frightening to see Data turn to his<br>
    Captain... slowly shake his head.</p>
  <p>18A INT. STARBOARD LOUNGE - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERING on a run, racing to the first large<br>
    port, from which the mystery object/vessel thing can<br>
    be seen from here too. He stands examining it. Then:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge to Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead, La Forge. What can you<br>
    make out?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is something I've never<br>
    seen before, sir.</p>
  <p>18B INT. MAIN BRIDGE - COMMAND AREA - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard intent upon:</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's as if it isn't entirely in<br>
    our dimension, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anything else?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Negative, sir. It's something<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I have some information on its<br>
    first transmission, sir. It<br>
    translates as...<br>
    (looks up)<br>
    ... &quot;stand by.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>18B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CONN CREWMEMBER<br>
    Sir! Sensors show something<br>
    emerging from that... that ship,<br>
    if you want to call it that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Verified. Something very small...</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE - ON MYSTERY OBJECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> REVEALING A TINY PINPOINT OF LIGHT having come out of<br>
    the side of the mystery object (no hatchway visible)<br>
    CROSSING orbital space toward the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data watching Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Getting smaller...</p>
  <p>21 EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Still smaller now, the PINPOINT OF LIGHT moves toward<br>
    the starship then actually passes through its &quot;solid&quot;<br>
    side.</p>
  <p>22 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Several crewpersons stopping, astonished at the sight<br>
    of what this CLOSER VIEW shows as the SWIRLING BLOB<br>
    OF LIGHT comes INTO SIGHT near the corridor deck and<br>
    passes on an upward diagonal path of EXITING VIEW near<br>
    the ceiling beyond. (It is on its way to the bridge.)</p>
  <p>23 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where Conn is reacting to an alarm from his panel.<br>
    Geordi RE-ENTERS bridge, takes his position.</p>
  <p> CONN CREWMEMBER<br>
    Intruder alert, sir! But I<br>
    don't...<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    ... show a location...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Why a tiny swirl of light,<br>
    Lieutenant? Could you make out<br>
    anything else?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (puzzling; looks up)<br>
    No, sir. Perhaps it is meant to<br>
    seem &quot;non-threatening&quot; to us.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    The away team signal has been cut<br>
    off, Captain! We are no longer<br>
    in contact with our people!</p>
  <p> Conn is very puzzled over a reading at his station.</p>
  <p> CONN CREWMEMBER<br>
    Intruder relays do show<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> He hesitates, puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why has everything become a<br>
    something, or a whatever?</p>
  <p> He gets his answer as the tiny SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT<br>
    COMES INTO VIEW. It is about the size of a 'light bulb'<br>
    now, moving more slowly than before. COMING IN ON AN<br>
    UPWARD ANGLE THROUGH THE DECK, IT STOPS NOW, SUSPENDED<br>
    IN THE MID-BRIDGE AREA.</p>
  <p>24 ANGLE ON COMMAND AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard has come to his feet, watching as the TINY<br>
    SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT which moves in his direction, and<br>
    STOPS. Picard has tried not to retreat before the<br>
    mysterious thing, but it is with some difficulty. Conn<br>
    has moved in holding a large hand phaser ready, but<br>
    has gotten a headshake from Picard. Then, from the tiny<br>
    swirling light object, a VOICE we'll come to know as<br>
    the EDOLORD. THE WORDS ARE TRANSMITTED WITH SUCH VOLUME<br>
    THAT THEY LITERALLY SHAKE THE BRIDGE (OPTICAL OR CAMERA<br>
    JIGGLE). A couple of the bridge crew throw hands to<br>
    ears protectively. At the same time, we HEAR SOUND OF<br>
    SOMETHING SHATTERING &quot;GLASSLIKE&quot; AS IT COMES APART,<br>
    various PANELS FLARE WITH LIGHT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    STATE THE PURPOSE...</p>
  <p> Apparently aware the volume has been too great, the<br>
    Edolord message is begun again at least at a bearable<br>
    volume level.</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing; repeating)<br>
    STATE...<br>
    (volume still reduced)<br>
    STATE THE PURPOSE OF WHAT YOU HAVE<br>
    DONE!</p>
  <p>25 SHOT PERMITTING NEXT EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard fighting to stay calm. As he realizes he has<br>
    heard the entire message:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Picard, commanding<br>
    this Federation starship...</p>
  <p> VIOLENTLY, THE ENTIRE MAIN BRIDGE BUCKS AND SHAKES<br>
    (OPTICAL AND/OR CAMERA MOVEMENTS) IN A WAY SUGGESTING<br>
    SOMETHING &quot;SHAKING SENSE&quot; INTO A SMALL CHILD OR ANIMAL.<br>
    All not seated are thrown to the deck or must hang on.</p>
  <p>26 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data moves toward the Command Area, examining the LIGHT<br>
    SWIRL.</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    (repeating)<br>
    STATE THE PURPOSE OF YOUR VISIT<br>
    HERE!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (toward LIGHT SWIRL)<br>
    We have sent down what we call an<br>
    away team to make peaceful contact<br>
    with...</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    DO YOU PLAN TO LEAVE LIFE FORMS<br>
    HERE?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... we are merely visiting<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    BUT YOU DID MORE AT THE WORLD<br>
    YOU JUST LEFT. WHY HAVE YOU LEFT<br>
    YOUR OWN LIFE FORMS THERE?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The colony we just planted, sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We found that world uninhabited.<br>
    The life forms we left there...<br>
    (carefully choosing his<br>
    words)<br>
    ... had sought the challenge...<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    ... at least that's the basic<br>
    reason... had sought the challenge<br>
    of creating a new lifestyle,<br>
    a new society there.<br>
    (beat; explaining)<br>
    All life on our world is driven<br>
    to... to protect its own form by<br>
    re-seeding itself as... as widely<br>
    as possible.</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V.O.)<br>
    DO NOT INTERFERE WITH MY CHILDREN<br>
    BELOW!</p>
  <p>27 ANGLE ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> genuinely puzzled over Picard's last statement.<br>
    Suddenly the TINY LIGHT SWIRL RISES TOWARD DATA, comes<br>
    to rest floating inches in front of his face. Then,<br>
    Data registers a surprised expression now as he<br>
    continues looking at the SWIRLING LIGHT OBJECT. Then:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain... I do not understand how,<br>
    but it is asking me if I was...<br>
    constructed for information<br>
    exchanges.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hesitates, then)<br>
    If there... is any way of our<br>
    learning more about whatever is<br>
    out there, Data...</p>
  <p> Data starts to nod, a movement which triggers action<br>
    -- the tiny LIGHT SWIRL moving in to touch Data's<br>
    forehead -- resulting in Data going down to the deck<br>
    with a crash.</p>
  <p>28 ANGLE DOWN ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> His entire form GLOWING as he goes stiff, eyes rolling<br>
    back in their sockets.</p>
  <p>29 EXT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> ESTABLISHING.</p>
  <p>30 CLOSER ON ENTRY</p>
  <p> as Wesley comes INTO VIEW with THREE EDO YOUTHS of about<br>
    his own age, two male and one a very pretty young female<br>
    who has very much caught Wesley's attention. The boys<br>
    have a ball; they're all smiling, laughing.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    Watch! You can't do this!</p>
  <p> The Edo boy stands expertly on his hands. Wesley eyes<br>
    this, decides to do something else. He turns a series<br>
    of cartwheels. The Edo kids CHEER with enthusiasm,<br>
    especially the girl who hugs Wesley impulsively.</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    I want to do something too! With<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (loses smile; warily)<br>
    Uh... What?</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    Something you can teach me. Will<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, actually, there are some<br>
    games I... uh, don't quite know<br>
    yet...</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    It's playing ball. Will you teach<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (relieved)<br>
    Oh, sure. If you have a bat for<br>
    the ball, I'll show you my<br>
    favorite.<br>
    (sees their puzzlement)<br>
    A bat...<br>
    (shows measurement)<br>
    ... a stick or branch, about this<br>
    thick, this long...</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    We can get it from the gardens.</p>
  <p> They race OFF leading the way, beginning to toss the<br>
    ball back and forth.</p>
  <p>31 INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> Riker in the midst of reacting to something Worf has<br>
    just said. With him the balance of the away team is<br>
    mixing happily with various of the Edo.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touching his insignia)<br>
    Enterprise, come in.<br>
    (waits, then again)<br>
    Captain, do you read me?</p>
  <p> He gets nothing in return. Troubled, he turns to Worf,<br>
    speaking quietly:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's... it may be nothing, but<br>
    let's move our people together.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods, then)<br>
    Including the boy, Wesley? He's<br>
    outside...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is there some problem?</p>
  <p> Troi has somehow sensed Riker's feelings and made her<br>
    way toward them now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've lost contact with our ship.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (scans room)<br>
    It's nothing these people have<br>
    done... I'm certain of that. Their<br>
    minds are so open...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Help me locate Wes. He's wandered<br>
    somewhere.</p>
  <p> He LEADS Troi toward the entrance as Worf eases his way<br>
    toward the rest of the Away Team.</p>
  <p>32 OMITTED</p>
  <p>33 INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - EMPHASIZING WORF</p>
  <p> Not wanting to create a false emergency, he works his<br>
    way toward Tasha carefully. She's with Rivan, Liator<br>
    and other Edo.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If I can take a moment of your<br>
    time, Lieutenant...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yes, Worf... but you've got to hear<br>
    this.<br>
    (to Liator)<br>
    Are you telling me that there's<br>
    no crime here whatsoever? No one<br>
    breaks any laws?</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Once they did. Long, long ago<br>
    there was much disorder.<br>
    (smiles; shakes head)<br>
    But not now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to Liator and Rivan)<br>
    But I've seen no sign of... of<br>
    police... those who enforce laws.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    We have very few. They're called<br>
    &quot;Mediators.&quot; And they are needed<br>
    only in one place each day...</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    The &quot;punishment zone.&quot; An area<br>
    that's selected for a period of<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's a completely random selection?</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    No one but our Mediators know what<br>
    place or for how long. We're very<br>
    proud of the wisdom of our<br>
    ancestors. No person ever knows<br>
    where or when a zone will be.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (smiling too)<br>
    ... and so no one risks death.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (suddenly alert)<br>
    Death?</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    ... by breaking any law.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Wait, let's explain this...</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (nodding, pleased)<br>
    Only one punishment for any<br>
    crime.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Anyone who commits any crime in<br>
    the punishment zone dies!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The law is the law. Our peace<br>
    is built on that.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Even a small thing? Such as<br>
    ignoring a rule like &quot;keep off<br>
    the grass?&quot;</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (nods; happily)<br>
    Then no one breaks that rule.<br>
    Who wants to risk execution?<br>
    There's always a white wall or<br>
    fence to remind anyone of a<br>
    forbidden area like that...</p>
  <p> Tasha begins EXITING calling a question back to the<br>
    Edo.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    And just who tells visitors of<br>
    those rules?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We'd better find Wesley!</p>
  <p> They leave behind two puzzled Edo.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 EXT. EDO GARDENS</p>
  <p> Wesley INTO VIEW with his friends, still tossing the<br>
    ball back and forth. He makes a difficult catch,<br>
    capturing the Edo girls' admiration again. (In b.g.<br>
    is an attractive, glassed potting shed surrounded by<br>
    a low white fence.)</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    You're very clever at this!</p>
  <p> Wesley decides to show off, runs ahead...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    At home we play a lot of it.<br>
    (gestures; running<br>
    ahead)<br>
    Here, toss the ball ahead of me!</p>
  <p> Which is done, but it is going over his head.</p>
  <p>35 CLOSE ON EDO GIRL</p>
  <p> registering concern.</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    No, Wes...</p>
  <p>36 PANNING WESLEY</p>
  <p> making a strong effort to reach the ball, leaping a<br>
    neat white fence at the potting enclosure. The Boys<br>
    are now registering too.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    (shouting)<br>
    No! It's forbidden to disturb<br>
    the new plants... !</p>
  <p>37 ANGLE ON WESLEY'S FALL</p>
  <p> Leaping for the ball, missing... falling into the<br>
    potting shed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>38 GROUP SHOT - THE YOUNG PEOPLE</p>
  <p> The girl hanging back, ANXIOUS. The boys pressing in,<br>
    short of the white fence. Wesley lying in the broken<br>
    glass of the Shed.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    Couldn't you see the fence?<br>
    That's for new plants...</p>
  <p> SECOND EDO BOY<br>
    (overlapping first)<br>
    Don't ever go past a white<br>
    marker!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (getting up)<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> The the girl sees someone approaching from O.S., reacts<br>
    horrified, SCREAMS.</p>
  <p>39 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> REVEALING a pair of Edo MEDIATORS (local law<br>
    enforcement) hurrying toward the potting shed area in<br>
    b.g. They are middle-aged men, exceedingly trim and<br>
    healthy-looking, also kindly in appearance. Their only<br>
    indication of office is a neat belt and pouch. But at<br>
    the sight of them the girl SHRIEKS AGAIN and it is from<br>
    genuine despair and fear for Wesley.</p>
  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    Oh, no! Oh, please, no!</p>

  <p> as Wesley climbs back over the fence, brushing himself<br>
    off. The Edo young people now back away, awed at what<br>
    has happened.</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    Speak the truth. We are<br>
    Mediators.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (brushing clothes)<br>
    I said I was fine. Just some<br>
    splinters...</p>

  <p> EDO GIRL<br>
    (staying back; through<br>
    tears)<br>
    He doesn't know; he's from another<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    (genuinely)<br>
    How very sad. But this zone has<br>
    been selected.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    He doesn't understand!</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It's always sad... now doubly so.</p>
  <p> SOUND OF RUNNING STEPS, heralding:</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    What's happening here?</p>
  <p>41 ANGLE TO INCLUDE RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> HURRYING IN to where the two Mediators stand with<br>
    Wesley. The Edo young people are frightened, stay in<br>
    b.g.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I was chasing a ball...<br>
    (indicating shed)<br>
    ... and fell into that. I'm<br>
    really sorry!</p>
  <p> MEDIATOR<br>
    You admit you did that? Freely?</p>
  <p> Wesley straightens up, throwing a look toward Riker.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm with Starfleet. We don't<br>
    lie.</p>
  <p> Riker gives Wesley a look with some pride hidden in it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Mediators)<br>
    It won't happen again. We<br>
    apologize.</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    We're sorry, too. But that<br>
    changes nothing.</p>
  <p> Mixed with MORE RUNNING FOOTSTEPS.</p>
  <p>42 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> TO INCLUDE the rest of the away team, Tasha and Worf,<br>
    as they ARRIVE.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Careful, Commander, they've got<br>
    some strange laws here...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought you reviewed the laws<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    But they list nothing about<br>
    punishment. That's what all this<br>
    is about.</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    One moment, please...<br>
    (to young Edo)<br>
    Is there a witness to this<br>
    transgression?</p>
  <p> Hesitantly, sadly, the other young people nod.</p>
  <p> FIRST EDO BOY<br>
    But it was my fault; I threw the<br>
    ball past him...</p>
  <p> First Mediator holds up his hand, appearing to be<br>
    genuinely saddened as he silences the Edo boy. Second<br>
    Mediator drops his head in a gesture of extreme sadness<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    We have a visible transgression,<br>
    ample witnesses, and an admission<br>
    of guilt...<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    ... and it deeply pains us to do<br>
    what we must. Are you prepared<br>
    for punishment?</p>
  <p> First Mediator has opened his pouch during this, brought<br>
    out a small device (to be identified as a syringe).<br>
    Second Mediator has stepped to get to the rear of<br>
    Wesley, trying to get past Riker.</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Please?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Punishment? If you mean what the<br>
    others were talking about...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (demanding)<br>
    What kind of punishment? Name<br>
    it!</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    Death, of course! Don't make<br>
    it...<br>
    (raising syringe)<br>
    ... difficult for the boy...</p>
  <p> Second Mediator has now squeezed past Riker, obviously<br>
    intending to grab Wesley's arms from the rear... and<br>
    is up-ended fast by Riker while Tasha and Worf bring<br>
    out phasers trained directly on First Mediator.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Drop that; drop it now!</p>
  <p> The Mediators seem even more stunned by what the humans<br>
    have done. The syringe has been dropped; Tasha<br>
    retrieves it, holds it for Riker's examination.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's a kind of syringe...</p>
  <p> Riker grabs it, holds it under First Mediator's nose.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is this? You said &quot;death;&quot;<br>
    is it &quot;poison?&quot;</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    (offended; very upset)<br>
    But... but of course it is!<br>
    Completely painless; the boy would<br>
    have felt nothing...<br>
    (indicating Wesley)<br>
    But look at him now. You've<br>
    frightened him!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (disbelieving)<br>
    He was going to kill me?</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    And if this Zone were still in<br>
    effect, you would all deserve<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    It was announced you came as<br>
    friends. Is this how friends act?</p>
  <p> During which Riker has touched his insignia.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enterprise from away team, come<br>
    in.<br>
    (waits)<br>
    Are you receiving us, Enterprise?</p>

  <p> Both anxious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    have encountered a strange<br>
    vessel-like object, one with<br>
    frightening power, which appears<br>
    to exist partly in another<br>
    dimension. On the world below...</p>
  <p>51 EXT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> ESTABLISHING. As before, both young and old are seen<br>
    traveling easily at a run.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... what began as a shore leave<br>
    opportunity among delightful<br>
    inhabitants of a lovely Earthlike<br>
    planet... has led incredibly to<br>
    a death sentence...</p>
  <p>52 INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> in which Picard is being led to what appears a &quot;seat of<br>
    honor&quot; next to Rivan, Liator, other planet folk. Riker,<br>
    Troi and Geordi are moving in to take a place next to<br>
    the Captain. Hovering anxiously nearby are Tasha and<br>
    Worf holding their small phasers unobtrusively in hand<br>
    as they scan the Edo, alert for any further surprises.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... a death sentence proclaimed<br>
    against... one of our crew members<br>
    for what our world considers a<br>
    petty, non-criminal infraction.<br>
    How can I allow a crew member<br>
    to die for that?<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    How does the Prime Directive apply<br>
    to this case? Indeed if we do<br>
    save our crewmember, how will the<br>
    frightening object up here react<br>
    to that?</p>
  <p>53 CLOSER ON KEY GROUP</p>
  <p> Before Picard takes his seat, he moves Troi aside,<br>
    speaks quietly:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Care to comment privately how you<br>
    read any of this...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    Unnecessary, sir.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    I get strong feelings that they<br>
    are honest almost to a fault.<br>
    But they do have great respect,<br>
    even pride, in their own ways.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to take his seat.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Welcome to our world, Captain.<br>
    We regret that our system of<br>
    justice is troubling you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley Crusher -- where is he?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In accord with the Prime<br>
    Directive, Captain, I've let them<br>
    hold him pending the outcome of<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (gently)<br>
    He is safe and unharmed. We<br>
    promise that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT FOUR 35.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Captain Picard... I do not know<br>
    how you Earth people conduct law<br>
    and justice; even if you respect<br>
    such things...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We do.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Good, so do we. Our precepts have<br>
    been handed down from long ago.<br>
    The tranquility you see in our<br>
    lives has been made possible by<br>
    our laws...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    We are a people of law. They do<br>
    sometimes bring us sadness, but<br>
    we have learned to adjust to that.<br>
    Perhaps your laws work as well...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They haven't always, but they do<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Do you execute criminals?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... not any longer, that is.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    You did once?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, yes. But since<br>
    then...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (interrupts)<br>
    And when you did, was it believed<br>
    necessary to do so?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we please get to the facts<br>
    concerning our crewmember?<br>
    (MORE)</p>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (waits; gets no answer)<br>
    Yes, some people then felt it was<br>
    necessary. But we've learned how<br>
    to detect the seeds of criminal<br>
    behavior... Capital punishment<br>
    is no longer justified in our<br>
    world as a deterrent.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    But you once believed execution<br>
    necessary.<br>
    (to Rivan)<br>
    So, we are not yet as &quot;advanced&quot;<br>
    as they are.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    And since you are &quot;advanced&quot; in<br>
    other ways too, I suggest you use<br>
    the, ah, transfer device...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    &quot;Beam... &quot;</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    ... the &quot;beam&quot; device to permit<br>
    the Wesley boy to escape from us.<br>
    We will record him as a convicted-criminal<br>
    out of our reach...<br>
    (then sarcasm)<br>
    ... an &quot;advanced&quot; person who<br>
    luckily escaped the barbarism of<br>
    this backward little world.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts uncomfortably to this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, we have a law<br>
    ourselves known as the Prime<br>
    Directive...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Riker has explained it to us...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is the boy in the slightest danger<br>
    from you right now?</p>

  <p> LIATOR<br>
    (to Rivan)<br>
    Until sundown?</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (nods; to Picard)<br>
    Because you are strangers, we are<br>
    delaying enforcement of the law.<br>
    But we must act by the time of<br>
    sundown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, I have another question now,<br>
    please. While orbiting... while<br>
    circling high above your world<br>
    as we do... we encountered a<br>
    strange object, a &quot;vessel&quot;<br>
    perhaps? Do you know of such a<br>
    thing? It was... well, you could<br>
    say not entirely real, at least<br>
    not completely what you might call<br>
    solid...</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Do you mean God?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    God?</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    God is said to be somewhere up<br>
    there. Protecting us.</p>
  <p> A long beat during which the Enterprise people exchange<br>
    looks, uncertain what this could mean.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly... exactly how would you<br>
    describe &quot;God?&quot;</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (indicating Picard)<br>
    As you just did. As existing<br>
    both here and in another place<br>
    also.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    But when God wants to show its<br>
    power, it can make itself felt<br>

    Picard, Troi, and Beverly. At the instant Rivan sees<br>
    it, she drops to one knee, clenching her eyes closed,<br>
    with hands crossed over her chest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, Rivan, but this was<br>
    necessary. Do you know what that<br>
    is?</p>
  <p> Rivan nods jerkily, her eyes still clenched closed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (waits; then gently)<br>
    Can you tell us what it is?</p>
  <p> Rivan stays frozen in the same position. Picard now<br>
    waits, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it &quot;God?&quot;</p>
  <p> Rivan again nods jerkily, eyes still clenched.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now, it's very important you<br>
    answer something. How do you<br>
    recognize what it is?</p>
  <p>57 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Rivan actually trembling. Troi bends close, speaks<br>
    encouragingly:</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing will harm you, I promise!<br>
    Just tell us how you recognize<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    (beat; weakly)<br>
    It... has appeared...before. It<br>
    is... the same.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you speak to it... Does it<br>
    speak to you?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... !</p>
  <p>57A ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi is pointing agitatedly to where the mysterious<br>
    object/vessel is GLOWING BRIGHTER, and the bridge<br>
    begins to shake as WE HEAR THE IMMENSE VOLUME OF THE<br>
    VOICE WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE BRIDGE.</p>
  <p> EDOLORD (V. O.)<br>
    RETURN MY CHILD!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Captain; puzzled)<br>
    &quot;Return... ?&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard's eye falls on the trembling Rivan and he<br>
    suddenly understands. The moment interrupted by the<br>
    Enterprise beginning to SHUDDER and the LIGHTS BLINK<br>
    OFF, EMPHASIZING THE NOW BRIGHTLY GLOWING EDOLORD<br>
    OBJECT/VESSEL.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's coming toward us, sir... !</p>
  <p> And this is exactly what is happening. THE EDOLORD<br>
    OBJECT/VESSEL IS MOVING TOWARD THE ENTERPRISE ON A<br>
    COLLISION COURSE. The Enterprise is SHAKING heavily<br>
    now, WE CAN HEAR STRUCTURAL STRAIN.</p>
  <p> Picard understands what to do, takes off his insignia,<br>
    attaching it to Rivan's clothing as:</p>

  <p> Beverly's words have come faster, louder, until she<br>
    finally realizes she is giving way emotionally. She<br>
    stops, controls herself with an effort we can see.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I... apologize, sir... but this is<br>
    very difficult for me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You saw what that thing was about<br>
    to do. I have a ship, an entire<br>

    If you felt the same, you'd be<br>
    as frightened and trembling...</p>

    But I am.</p>
  <p> They face each other silently. Then she nods.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data is in Sickbay here. You'll<br>
    find him able to talk.</p>
  <p>58 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Data is conscious, being scanned on Sickbay equipment by<br>
    a MEDICAL TECHNICIAN. As Beverly and Picard ENTER, the<br>
    Technician pauses in what he is doing.</p>
  <p> MEDICAL TECHNICIAN<br>
    He's checking out fine, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    It is perhaps not what we'd<br>
    understand as a &quot;vessel,&quot; sir.<br>
    The dimensions this one occupies<br>
    allows them to... well, to be in<br>
    several places at once. But they<br>
    consider this entire star cluster<br>
    to be theirs, and it was probably<br>
    unwise of us to attempt to place<br>
    a human colony in this area.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please &quot;organize&quot; it into brief<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That would be a case of judging<br>

    silently observed by it. I am<br>
    concerned whether it understands<br>

    You have a facility for seeing<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The problem, sir, is there!<br>
    (indicates mystery<br>

    Although they have learned of the<br>
    Prime Directive from my mind, how<br>
    will they evaluate it? How do<br>
    they reason? What are their<br>
    values? Remember its warning<br>
    to us, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly. How do I explain not<br>
    obeying the laws down there, not<br>
    permitting young Crusher's<br>
    execution? Does that endanger<br>
    this ship and over a thousand<br>
    other lives?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you choose one life over<br>
    one thousand, sir?</p>

    I refuse to let arithmetic decide<br>
    questions like that!</p>

    indicates out toward the mysterious object/vessel again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    once existed in this dimension,<br>
    just as we do. Perhaps also in<br>
    the same kind of &quot;flesh and blood&quot;<br>
    form. Since then, however, they<br>
    have evolved considerably further.<br>
    Their present existence in mixed<br>

    we do not understand...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    blood existence they could have<br>
    once shared our kind of values.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Edo share them, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why would advanced things like<br>
    that feel obliged to protect the<br>
    Edo?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps because the Edo are a<br>

    Edo, eyes still<br>

    And the boy too.</p>
  <p> The Edo there shuffle nervously, uncertainly. They have<br>
    always appeared to be a calm, intelligent life form,<br>
    never seeming overly superstitious, but should they<br>
    reject this possibility? Beverly turns to Picard<br>
    hopefully; is this an answer to the dilemma? Then<br>
    Picard bends, lifts Rivan up by her elbows.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no, we're not &quot;Gods.&quot;<br>

  <p> LIATOR<br>
    We did not ask you to come here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Which has to do with another law<br>
    I must obey. All of us are sworn<br>
    not to interfere with other life<br>
    in the galaxy. I am caught<br>
    between the two. If I save this<br>
    young man, I break that law...</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    And you should be executed if you<br>
    do so!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I may suffer almost as much.<br>
    Starfleet takes our Prime<br>
    Directive very seriously...</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    No, it is God who will punish you!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    That has crossed our minds too.</p>
  <p> LIATOR<br>
    Our laws have been violated. What<br>
    of justice?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What of justice to Wesley? Does<br>
    he deserve to die?</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    What makes our law strong is the<br>
    certainty of punishment!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But my son had no warning...</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    We cannot allow ignorance of the<br>
    law to become a defense...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIVAN<br>
    Is it possible we are wrong about<br>
    that? Surely there is such a<br>
    thing as too much harshness...</p>
  <p> FIRST MEDIATOR<br>
    We do not dispense mercy... only<br>
    justice.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (calls from entrance)<br>
    Their sun is almost down, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Stand ready to beam out.</p>
  <p>65 ANGLE FOR BEAM OUT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Away Team gathers in position. CROSSING toward<br>
    them, Picard passes Liator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The question of justice has<br>
    concerned me a good deal lately.<br>
    Pained me. Until now, Liator.<br>
    I realize now that there can be<br>
    no justice...</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    God will destroy you!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (back to Liator)<br>
    ... no justice so long as laws are<br>
    absolute. Life itself is an<br>
    exercise in exceptions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Bravo. When has justice ever been<br>
    as simple as a rulebook, sir?<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Six to beam up, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (touches insignia)<br>
    Six to beam up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SECOND MEDIATOR<br>
    (screams it)<br>
    God will punish you!</p>
  <p> And with this ringing in their ears, they BEAM OUT.</p>
  <p>66 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND MYSTERY OBJECT/VESSEL</p>
  <p> both still in orbit.</p>
  <p>67 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the turbolift DISCHARGES Picard, Riker and the<br>
    others. The balance of our regulars are on duty there<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Main Viewer on!</p>
  <p> They slowly take their positions, eyes on the Viewer.<br>
    As Wesley ENTERS with Beverly, Geordi looks up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Greetings, Jailbird.</p>
  <p> It doesn't get a big laugh at this moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To the object sharing this<br>
    orbit... we will remove the human<br>
    colonists from the adjoining solar<br>
    system if signaled to do so. Or<br>
    we'll proceed on our mission, if<br>
    signaled to do that. Please tell<br>
    us...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p> The IMAGE on the Viewer begins FADING, FINALLY<br>
    DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Justice&quot; - 9/4/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Is that a signal?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I was hoping for more.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    More of what, sir? I'm happy it's<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We're all thrilled with that, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I was hoping we'd learn more about<br>
    it. But since we can't...<br>
    (looks to Riker)<br>
    Take us out of here, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Gladly, sir.</p>
  <p>68 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it begins leaving orbit.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
