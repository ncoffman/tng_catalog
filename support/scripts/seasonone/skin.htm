    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels through space on impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41801.3.<br>
    We are crossing through the Zed<br>
    Lapis sector, where we will<br>
    rendezvous with Shuttlecraft<br>
    Thirteen carrying Deanna Troi,<br>
    who is returning from a<br>
    psychology conference.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The usual CREW is in place, except for Troi and Wesley.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Because Engineering is taking this<br>
    opportunity to complete preventive<br>
    maintenance on dilithium<br>
    crystals, we are traveling on<br>
    impulse power.</p>
  <p> Tasha and Worf are at the Aft station, working the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Routine deep sensor probe<br>
    indicates no obstacles, no vessels<br>
    within a range of three light<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Short-range sub-space radar<br>
    confirms.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The martial arts competition is<br>
    in three days. Are you prepared?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    If you'll meet me on the Holodeck<br>
    later. I need your help on the<br>
    Mishiama wrist-lock and break.<br>
    If it works on you, I can use it<br>
    on anyone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A valid assumption. Who is your<br>
    first competitor?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    The aikido match is with Science<br>
    Officer Swenson.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will defeat him easily.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    I'm more concerned with Lieutenant<br>
    Minnerly's kick-boxing.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are favored in the ship's<br>
    pool.</p>
  <p> Tasha just looks at him, then smiles, surprised.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You bet on me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A sure thing.</p>
  <p>2A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, estimated rendezvous with<br>
    the shuttle in one hour, ten<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good, Lieutenant.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    It's not the same around here<br>
    without Counselor Troi, is it,<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> Riker's not sure if Picard's needling him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir. It seems...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    ... Sir! I am receiving an<br>
    emergency transmission from the<br>
    shuttle!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put it on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't. We are receiving audio<br>
    only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then open the frequency.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    (crackling; calm)<br>
    ... what a jolt!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Position report.</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir, I have an onboard systems<br>
    failure. You'll have to tell<br>
    me where I am.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I read coordinates three-zero-seven<br>
    mark one-two-six. Confirm!</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Can't confirm. My instruments<br>
    are haywire.</p>
  <p> The bridge crew REACTS with concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Prieto, is Counselor<br>
    Troi all right?</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir. Just a little shaken.<br>
    We're being buffeted a bit...</p>
  <p> A GREAT STATIC ECHOES through the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing; slightly<br>
    panicked; breaking up)<br>
    ... losing more power! My flight<br>
    control computer's fried.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Main Engineering!</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING (INTERCUT WITH MAIN BRIDGE AS<br>
    NECESSARY)</p>
  <p> where LIEUTENANT COMMANDER LELAND T. LYNCH and his<br>
    crew are working on DILITHIUM CRYSTALS. The door to<br>
    the chamber is OPEN. Lynch touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Engineering. Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Leland T. Lynch<br>
    reporting, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will it take to return<br>
    to warp power?</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Captain! I'm in the middle of<br>
    realigning the dilithium<br>
    crystals.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's an emergency, Lynch. I<br>
    need warp drive. How long?</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Twenty minutes. Maybe more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We don't have it.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    I'll align it by hand. Then<br>
    power up the core.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whatever it takes.</p>
  <p> A frustrated Lynch starts to move quickly.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (to his workers)<br>
    Let's go!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> the crew is very tense.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shuttle, this is the Enterprise.<br>
    Coordinates now read two-thirty-seven<br>
    mark one-oh-one. You're<br>
    moving in too close towards a<br>
    large mass.</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    I can see it. The planet's<br>
    getting closer.</p>
  <p> More STATIC fills the bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The planet is Vagra Two of the<br>
    Zed Lapis system. Uninhabited.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, report!</p>
  <p> TROI'S COM VOICE<br>
    This is Counselor Troi. I'll<br>
    relay, sir. The pilot is...<br>
    busy. We've lost most of our<br>
    impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engineering! Status report!</p>
  <p> LYNCH'S COM VOICE<br>
    Working on it. Three minutes,<br>
    Captain. But there are no<br>
    guarantees.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deanna, we'll be right there.</p>
  <p> Riker and the crew become very anxious as the STATIC<br>
    again fills the bridge.</p>
  <p> TROI'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... We're spinning around...</p>
  <p> BEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're caught in the planet's<br>
    gravity.</p>
  <p> TROI'S COM VOICE<br>
    (very controlled)<br>
    We're going to crash.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The faces of her friends reflect their fear and<br>
    anguish, as WE:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still on impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    We've lost all contact with<br>
    Shuttlecraft Thirteen -- and can<br>
    only assume they've crash-landed<br>
    on Vagra Two. Main Engineering<br>
    is working at top speed to return<br>
    us to warp power.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> where Lynch places the dilithium crystals on their<br>
    proper tray.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Forget the final check.</p>
  <p>7 CLOSER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the tray with the crystals is placed within the<br>
    chamber and the door CLOSES. Lynch WALKS to the<br>
    Computer.</p>
  <p>7A LYNCH AT THE COMPUTER</p>

  <p> LYNCH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, this is Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Leland T. Lynch. You<br>
    have minimum warp drive.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as Geordi watches his console closely. He waits for<br>
    Data's signal.</p>

  <p>10 OMITTED</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The crew calmly but rapidly performs their duties.<br>
    Riker sits almost immobilized next to Picard. Beverly<br>
    puts her hand on his arm.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Approaching Vagra Two.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Strange, sir. No emergency<br>
    signal from the shuttle as yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reassuring himself)<br>
    They're designed to withstand<br>
    almost any impact.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Beginning a deeper probe, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is this place, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no information in the<br>
    library computer, sir, other than<br>
    the fact of its existence. No<br>
    signs of any known higher life-form.<br>
    Virtually no vegetation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    Standard orbit, aye.</p>
  <p>11A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) (FORMERLY SC. 10)</p>
  <p> as it ENTERS orbit around Vagra 2.</p>
  <p>12 CLOSE ON PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> Riker's scared for Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I could have set up the rendezvous<br>
    in a dozen alternate sites.</p>
  <p> Picard knows what he's really saying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She means a lot to all of us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She's not dead. I'd know it.</p>
  <p>13 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> INCLUDING Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've located the shuttle!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not yet, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker REACTS to the possibility that Troi is dead.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Still probing. It appears to be<br>
    buried under a lot of debris.</p>
  <p> Worf shakes his head, then sees a FLICKER on the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I may have something, sir!</p>
  <p> He makes an adjustment on his instruments. Riker's<br>
    out of his chair instantly, looking over Worf's<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Faint life signs. Very faint.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How many?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There's no way of telling from<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we beam up the injured?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. Our sensors are not fully<br>
    penetrating whatever the debris<br>
    is, sir. I cannot explain it.</p>
  <p> A puzzled concerned REACTION from Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's very unusual.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. I cannot explain it.</p>
  <p> Picard gets a call.</p>
  <p> LYNCH'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, this is Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Leland T. Lynch. Can<br>
    I shut down the warp drive now<br>
    for a full realignment?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    Thanks. That's fine...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Wait.<br>
    (something is picking<br>
    at him)<br>
    Not yet.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    You'll have full impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand, but for the moment<br>
    I want all systems at full<br>
    readiness -- especially propulsion.</p>
  <p> LYNCH<br>
    As you wish, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Assemble your team, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right away.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll meet you in Transporter Room<br>
    Four.</p>
  <p> Riker gets up quickly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yar, Data.</p>
  <p> They're already halfway out of their positions and<br>
    HEADING for the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>14 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM FOUR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The team is assembled on the pad when Beverly COMES<br>
    IN with TWO MEDICAL TECHNICIANS and gear. They MOVE<br>
    ONTO the pad.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief works the console and the away<br>
    team DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p>15 EXT. VAGRA 2 (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Vagra 2 is arid, desolate, with very rocky terrain.<br>
    It's always dusk. The team BEAMS IN about ten meters<br>
    from the crash site. The shuttle appears to have<br>
    crashed into a hill. It's almost completely buried,<br>
    obscured by ROCKS. There is an eerie stillness, a<br>
    deadness about the place. Tasha takes readings.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Ben must have had no control<br>
    left, otherwise he would have<br>
    picked a better spot.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's go. The life signs are<br>
    weak.</p>
  <p> Tasha starts to lead the team quickly and cautiously<br>
    towards the shuttle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>16 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As they near the shuttle, they run into an obstacle -<br>
    a BLACK, SHINY, VISCOUS MASS lying on the ground.</p>
  <p>16A ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> They STOP for a beat and look at the slime. Data<br>
    takes a tricorder reading.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> No one has an answer.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No idea. We'll go around. Just<br>
    to be on the safe side.</p>
  <p>16B ANGLE ON TASHA</p>
  <p> As she leads the away team around the slick, it MOVES<br>
    PARALLEL with them so it stays between them and the<br>
    shuttle. The team STOPS.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We'll go the other way.</p>
  <p>16C ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> The away team CIRCLES AROUND the other way. And again,<br>
    the slick stays between them and the shuttle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (touching his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Enterprise, this is Riker. We've<br>
    got a problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    What kind of a problem, Number<br>
    One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure yet. There's some<br>
    kind of a slick blocking our<br>
    path. We'll keep you apprised.</p>

    Inconclusive, sir. I cannot tell<br>
    you what it is -- only what it is<br>
    not.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no evidence of neural<br>
    or circulatory systems. No<br>
    internal organs. Cellular<br>
    structure unknown. It does not<br>
    have any proteins which are known<br>
    to us.</p>
  <p> The slime remains SILENT and STILL... Until:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's narrower over here. Can<br>
    we get over it?</p>
  <p> They try -- but it EXPANDS, so they can't pass.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait, Beverly. How is it moving,<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know, sir. It does not<br>
    appear to have any skeletal<br>
    framework or musculature.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what's causing it to move?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we are. It appears to<br>
    be following us, sir.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    No readings of intelligence.<br>
    No brain as we know it. But<br>
    evidence of thought, Mister Data?</p>

    While on the planet Vagra Two to<br>
    rescue members of the crew who<br>
    were injured in a rather strange<br>
    and unexplained shuttle crash,<br>
    the away team, lead by Commander<br>
    Riker, has encountered a strange<br>
    creature which seems to be able<br>
    to take many forms, including<br>
    something which is humanoid.</p>

  <p> Picard touches his arm panel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go easy, Number One. Let's find<br>
    out what it is we are dealing with<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Agreed, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Number One, I don't believe<br>
    the location shuttle crash and<br>
    the proximity of this creature<br>
    is necessarily a coincidence.</p>
  <p>C21 EXT. PLANET VAGRA 2</p>
  <p> Riker moves a STEP CLOSER to the creature.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander William Riker of<br>
    the USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I am ARMUS. Why do you intrude<br>
    into my space?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>C21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We mean you no harm. We have an<br>
    injured crew in that shuttlecraft.<br>
    We need to get to them. May we<br>
    pass?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    That is important to you? That<br>
    they live?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. Preserving life -- all life<br>
    -- is very important to us.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We believe that everything in the<br>
    universe has a right to exist.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Interesting. Irrelevant. But<br>
    you may now leave if you wish.</p>
  <p> Riker and the crew are startled.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We won't without the shuttle<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> The shroud REMAINS SILENT as Tasha makes a slight MOVE<br>
    TO GO AROUND IT.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You will not like it here.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What are you saying -- that you<br>
    are going to try and deny us<br>
    access and attempt to force us<br>
    to leave without our comrades?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I told you what you can do. You<br>
    can leave.</p>
  <p> Tasha has had enough of this and starts to move toward<br>
    the narrowest strip of slime.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Enough. We have people who need<br>
    attention. We mean you no harm,<br>
    but do not interfere.</p>

    to the ground.</p>
  <p>22 ON THE TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everything from here on must happen in a blur of<br>

  <p>30 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> The medical team is easing Tasha onto the operating<br>

    him. He MOVES OFF TO THE SIDE and watches silently,<br>
    with Data and Riker, as:</p>
  <p>31 CLOSE ON DIAGNOSTIC SCREEN</p>
  <p> which shows her bodily readings to be totally askew.</p>
  <p>32 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly and the Nurse work together as if they'd done<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's dead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Nurse immediately helps her attach the device,<br>
    which clips onto the bed and slips over Tasha's head<br>
    like a loose headband. As soon as both devices are<br>
    activated, Beverly and the Nurse anxiously watch the<br>
    diagnostic screen. A FEW KEY INDICATORS APPROACH<br>
    NORMALITY. Picard is anxious and impatient.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There. You did it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I've got her on total<br>
    support. There's no independent<br>
    brain activity.</p>
  <p> Beverly grimly and quickly works the neural<br>
    stimulator. She pushes programming keys furiously,<br>
    then hits the start button. No reaction.</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    She's not responding, Doctor.<br>
    Her synaptic network is breaking<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No! Inject norep.</p>
  <p> The Nurse complies as Beverly reprograms the<br>
    stimulator. Nothing happens.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're going for direct reticular<br>
    stimulation.</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    Risky.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What does that mean?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Doesn't matter! Do it!</p>
  <p> The Nurse punches it in, and Tasha's body TWITCHES<br>
    SLIGHTLY. Picard looks hopefully at Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She moved!</p>

  <p> The Nurse complies. Beverly pushes the button. Tasha<br>
    MOVES SLIGHTLY -- VERY SLIGHTLY. Beverly checks the<br>
    readout. Data and Riker looks at each other -- it's<br>
    not good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Doctor?</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's too much synaptic damage.<br>
    That thing just sucked all the<br>

    I can do...</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Data seem rooted to the spot.</p>
  <p>34 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly reluctantly pushes in a code on the overbed<br>
    life support clamshell. She and the others look up<br>
    at the big diagnostic wall screen and watch all the<br>
    LIFE FUNCTION INDICATORS FALL TO ZERO. They REACT<br>
    to the finality of this.</p>

  <p>36A EXT. VAGRA 2 (FORMERLY SCENE 39)</p>
  <p> ARMUS has slithered up the shuttle and covered the<br>

  <p>36B INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (FORMERLY SCENE 40)</p>
  <p> Troi is startled. She feels very uncomfortable and<br>
    looks around, seeing nothing, but feeling -- an<br>
    intimate sense of evil.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    Your friends have deserted you.<br>
    They're not coming back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're wrong.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    I killed one of them.</p>
  <p> Troi is very sad.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. I know.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    How could you be in there and know<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt her die.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    Do you want to know why I killed<br>
    her?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    No, none. It was too easy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You wanted her to suffer. You<br>
    have a great need.</p>

  <p> Riker slams the table and fights back tears of outrage.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It just killed her. No reason.<br>
    No justification. A senseless,<br>

  <p> Picard waits, while the members of his crew purge their<br>
    anger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. This is very emotional<br>

    Yes, equally.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    Now it is you who lie. There is<br>
    one who is loved more.</p>
  <p> Troi changes the direction of this conversation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You were really surprised that<br>
    they came back.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why? Because the others did not?</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    (now it is the creature<br>
    who is uncomfortable)<br>
    What others?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You can't hide the emptiness from<br>
    me. The others. The ones who<br>
    hurt you. Who left you -- alone --<br>
    rejected. The ones who make you<br>
    so angry.</p>
  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    What do you know of them?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Only what you tell me.</p>

    Captain. Look at this.</p>
  <p> Picard APPROACHES the Aft station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The force of the energy field<br>
    around the shuttle just took a<br>
    dip. It was almost low enough<br>
    for us to beam them out. Now,<br>
    as the creature approaches the<br>
    away team, the energy field<br>
    increases.</p>
  <p> Picard is pensive for a moment.</p>

  <p> ARMUS<br>
    She said you'd be back, but I<br>
    didn't think so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have no choice.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I sense anger directed at me.</p>
  <p> Riker deflects the statement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm here to negotiate. What is<br>
    it you want?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Maybe I want nothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you would have killed us<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>

    I still might.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you want something? Tell me.<br>
    Maybe we can reach an<br>
    accommodation.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You would do that even after what<br>
    I did to the fair one?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    If I tell you what it is... will<br>
    you give it to me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know... I guess it<br>
    depends.</p>

    Not good enough.</p>

  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Say please.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>

  <p> Riker makes a reflexive MOVE TOWARD THE SHUTTLE.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She needs our help.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You have no permission to pass.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are people suffering a few<br>
    meters away, and you block our<br>
    path. Why?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You asked to talk. I allowed it.<br>
    Wasn't that enough for you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I need help to get to them.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You are ungrateful.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are evil and disgusting. What<br>
    are you made of?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It does not register on my<br>
    tricorder, Doctor.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    &quot;It?&quot; Does that mean I am not<br>
    alive?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. Clearly you are some kind<br>
    of intelligent form.</p>
  <p> ARMUS pulls the tricorder out of Data's hands and sails<br>
    it over the horizon.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Then your instrument lies. It<br>
    is useless. Perhaps all your<br>
    instruments are useless.</p>
  <p> The shroud instantaneously RIPS OFF GEORDI'S VISOR.<br>
    Data immediately REACTS to assist.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't help him.</p>

  <p> Geordi helplessly MOVES TOWARDS THE VISOR. ARMUS<br>
    MOVES IT. Riker puts his hand on Beverly's arm. They<br>
    stay out of it -- both furious.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One meter to your left, Geordi.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves that way, bends down and almost reaches it<br>
    when the shroud MOVES IT again, behind him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Behind you.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and feels his way. The Shroud MOVES IT<br>
    again. Data says nothing more while Geordi searches.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Aren't you going to lead him to<br>
    his sight again, robot?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. You will just move it again.<br>
    I will not help you hurt him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None of us will help you.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    (disgusted)<br>
    Then give it to him. I will find<br>
    something else to do. Wait right<br>

  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    You said I wouldn't enjoy it.<br>
    You were wrong.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Still the great emptiness remains.<br>
    You sound so alone.</p>

  <p> ARMUS (O.S.)<br>
    I am alone. I am the discarded<br>
    skin of a creature whose beauty<br>
    dazzles all who see it. But I<br>
    am its refuse -- left here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You have my pity.</p>
  <p> The shuttle SHAKES with the creature's rage.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Your pity! Save that for<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> For the first time -- the first time -- WE SEE a ripple<br>
    of FEAR on Troi's face.</p>
  <p>51C EXT. PLANET</p>
  <p> ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES<br>
    THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him.<br>
    He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Touch him and he dies.</p>
  <p> As the away team watches, Riker - fighting with all<br>
    his might -is pulled inexorably toward the slime. From<br>
    the other direction, Armus also MOVES toward the hole.<br>
    As the creature's SHRIEK joins RIKER'S SCREAM, the two<br>
    SLIP INTO THE SLIME HOLE and DISAPPEAR. For a beat<br>
    there is nothing. Then: WE CAN SEE only RIKER'S FACE<br>

  <p> Picard STEPS OVER and studies the graphic display.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have a chart of the energy<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are a great deal of<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes - but there is a pattern.<br>

  <p> At that moment Picard BEAMS DOWN next to the away<br>

  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Ah. Another human has arrived.<br>
    A very bold one, too. Perhaps<br>
    the party is complete.</p>
  <p> The shroud LIFTS ITSELF TO ITS TORSO to greet the<br>
    Captain. At that moment A LIKENESS OF RIKER'S FACE<br>
    PUSHES THROUGH AND STRAINS AGAINST THE SHROUD, AND THEN<br>
    DISAPPEARS again. They see it and control themselves.<br>
    They will never mention what they've seen to ARMUS.<br>
    The captain and the creature face each other.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You must be the chief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    Enterprise. Is Commander Riker<br>
    dead?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Guess.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I would guess that death is no<br>
    longer sufficient entertainment<br>
    to alleviate its boredom.<br>
    Therefore, Commander Riker is<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Maybe.</p>
  <p> Picard stares closely at ARMUS.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>

    Don't you want to ask me what I<br>
    want?</p>

    No.</p>

  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Then, to protect your own<br>
    existence, maybe you'd better give<br>
    me a reason. Entertain me. Be<br>
    creative. Then perhaps I won't<br>
    kill your assistant. You do care<br>
    very much about that, don't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> The shroud looks in Data's direction and suddenly --<br>
    completely against Data's will -- an unseen force causes<br>
    Data's hand to take his phaser and point it at Picard.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Robot, how would you feel if you<br>
    were the instrument of death for<br>
    your leader?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't struggle, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> Data relaxes into it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have no control over what you<br>
    do with the phaser. Therefore,<br>
    I would not be the instrument of<br>
    his death.</p>
  <p> ARMUS ignores him - and TURNS THE PHASER ON BEVERLY.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Perhaps the kind doctor would<br>
    engender more feeling?</p>
  <p> He SWINGS DATA'S ARM VIOLENTLY AROUND so the phaser<br>
    points at his own temple.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    How does it feel facing your own<br>
    extinction? I won't call it<br>
    death. You're not alive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It feels -- curious.</p>
  <p> ARMUS stops the game - and DROPS THE PHASER. The<br>

    Yes. You can. But only I can<br>

  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Then it is you. Amuse me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not until I know if the ones in<br>

    Shall I tell you what true evil<br>

    Set the computer. When the energy<br>
    level reaches two point six point<br>
    two-oh-five, automatically beam<br>
    up Troi and Prieto. We'll do a<br>
    parallel transport of the<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p>64 EXT. VAGRA - NEAR ARMUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The captain MATERIALIZES and faces ARMUS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long have you been on this<br>
    planet?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Since they left.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Someone was here before?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Long ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They abandoned you. Who were<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    A race of titans. So they<br>
    thought. Together, they perfected<br>
    a method of bringing to the<br>
    surface all that was evil and<br>
    negative within them. All this<br>
    erupted on the outside, spread,<br>
    and connected. In time, it formed<br>
    a second skin, dank and vile.<br>
    They found a way to rid themselves<br>
    of it, leaving them free of the<br>
    bonds of destructiveness. Then<br>
    they left. And here I am.</p>

  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must be very lonely.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You cannot trick me by pretending<br>
    compassion, captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Haven't you seen we humans are<br>
    capable of compassion?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Oh, yes. It is revolting. Time<br>
    and again you rise from despair<br>
    into hope. From hate into<br>
    understanding. From aloneness<br>
    into love. But you are puny.<br>
    Weak. Vessels that die from a<br>
    flick of my power.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But our spirit soars. A great<br>
    poet once said &quot;all spirits are<br>
    enslaved which serve things evil.&quot;</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Picard, it is impossible for you<br>
    to accept that I am truly evil.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because you are not.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I am a skin of evil.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing in the universe is the<br>
    same as anything else -- but<br>
    everything has light and dark.</p>
  <p> ARMUS is SILENT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They did not leave you because<br>
    they hated you. They didn't<br>
    understand you.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You don't know that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>65 EXT. THE SHROUD (OPTICAL) (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> Picard moves back a little bit from the shroud. The<br>
    next actions happen almost simultaneously.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (checking his readings)<br>
    Energy shields are way down!<br>
    Computer is beginning transport.</p>
  <p>65A INT. THE SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ben and Troi begin the BEAM UP.</p>
  <p>65B EXT. THE SHROUD</p>
  <p> as Picard begins to BEAM UP. The ARMUS REACTS slightly<br>
    late. All he can do is lean back his head and SHRIEK.<br>
    He's been left again.</p>
  <p>66 EXT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the Enterprise uses PINPOINT PHASER POWER TO<br>
    completely DESTROY THE SHUTTLE.</p>
  <p>67 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it LEAVES ORBIT of Vagra 2.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. The<br>
    shuttlecraft has been destroyed<br>
    to prevent any possibility of<br>
    Armus leaving the planet. Vagra<br>
    2 has been declared an off-limits<br>
    planet, but the damage has been<br>
    done. One of the saddest duties<br>
    I have to perform is ahead of me.</p>
  <p>68 INT. ENTERPRISE - PASTORAL AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is set up as a kind of glade, filled with people<br>
    who loved Tasha. The bridge crew FILES IN, one by one.<br>
    Beverly ENTERS first. Troi is pale, and weak, but<br>
    recovering. She leans on Riker, whose face still shows<br>
    some effects of the shroud. Geordi and Worf COME IN,<br>
    followed by Data. Wesley is leading them to their<br>
    assigned seats.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    This is where you're supposed to<br>
    sit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know. The captain gave<br>
    me a seating plan.</p>
  <p> He sits down next to his mother, who smiles at him and<br>
    puts her arm around him. He moves in closer to her,<br>
    needing her comfort. Picard goes to the front.<br>
    Everything is quiet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are here together to honor our<br>
    friend and comrade Lieutenant<br>
    Natasha Yar. We will have much<br>
    time to grieve for her in the days<br>
    ahead, but for now, she has asked<br>
    that we celebrate her life -- with<br>
    her. She has left a living will.</p>
  <p> He moves to sit in his assigned seat in the middle of<br>
    the front row. The LIGHTS DIM. And as a HOLOGRAPHIC<br>
    IMAGE OF TASHA APPEARS in front of the group, there are<br>
    gasps of surprise -- each of the bridge crew REACTS to<br>
    the Image in front of them.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Welcome, my friends. You are here<br>
    now watching this image of me<br>
    because I have died. It probably<br>
    happened while I was on duty, and<br>
    quickly, which is what I expected,<br>
    and what I wanted. Never forget<br>
    I died doing exactly what I chose<br>
    to do.</p>
  <p> As Tasha speaks, she looks out at the gathering as if<br>
    she's really a part of it.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What I want you to know is how<br>
    much I loved my life... and each<br>
    of you who shared it with me.<br>
    You are my &quot;family.&quot;<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA (Cont'd)<br>
    Whoever I was before Starfleet,<br>
    where I came from, isn't<br>
    important. I have been blessed<br>
    with your friendship and your<br>
    love.</p>
  <p> She looks directly at Riker.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Will Riker, you are the best.<br>
    From the moment you beamed on<br>
    board, you never failed me. You<br>
    trusted me, you encouraged me<br>
    and most of all, you made me<br>
    laugh.</p>
  <p> She smiles right at him and he can't help but smile<br>
    back. Troi holds his hand tightly.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; looking<br>
    at Troi)<br>
    Deanna... you are capable of so<br>
    much love, you taught me without<br>
    ever having to say a word. I<br>
    realized I could be feminine<br>
    without losing anything --<br>
    something I never thought I could<br>
    achieve.</p>
  <p> Troi wipes a tear from her cheek.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; looking<br>
    at Worf)<br>
    Ah, Worf. I hope for your sake<br>
    I met death with my eyes open.<br>
    We are so much alike, you and<br>
    I, both warriors, orphans who<br>
    found ourselves this family.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at her image, unbelieving and pained.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; to Beverly)<br>
    My friend, Beverly. True to<br>
    yourself, your ideals. Your<br>
    fierce devotion comes from within.<br>
    It can't be diminished. From<br>
    you I have learned to strive for<br>
    excellence, no matter what the<br>
    personal cost.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Shroud&quot; - 2/1/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Beverly and Wesley hold tight to each other.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; to Wesley)<br>
    Wesley, I'm sorry that I won't<br>
    be able to see you grow into the<br>
    exceptional man you'll be. But<br>
    I have my vision of who you are<br>
    and your kindness and innocence<br>
    is ageless.</p>
  <p> The Tasha hologram turns to face Geordi. Who knows how<br>
    he sees her in this half-state?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Geordi, in those moments I felt<br>
    the most despair, you took my hand<br>
    and made everything better. Your<br>
    innate joy taught me to look<br>
    beyond the moment.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks down -- he can't bear to see/not see her.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mister Data. Android...<br>
    automaton... robot.<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    No. You see things with the<br>
    wonder of a child, and that makes<br>
    you more human than any of us.<br>
    I love you just the way you are.</p>
  <p> The Tasha image turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard. I can't<br>
    say you've been like a father to<br>
    me, because I never had one and<br>
    I don't know what it feels like.<br>
    But if I could choose someone in<br>
    this universe to be like, someone<br>
    who I would want to make proud<br>
    of me, it's you. You who have<br>
    the heart of an explorer and the<br>
    soul of a poet. So you will<br>
    understand when I say &quot;Death is<br>
    that state in which one exists<br>
    only in the memory of others...<br>
    which is why it is not an end.&quot;<br>

  <p>68 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TASHA (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No good-byes. Just &quot;au revoir,&quot;<br>
    my friends.</p>
  <p> Picard waits a moment, and as Tasha's IMAGE FADES:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Au revoir, Natasha.</p>
  <p> He gets up before the group.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The service is concluded.</p>
  <p> As everyone FILES OUT, Data gets up and WALKS OVER to<br>
    where the Tasha image was standing. He looks puzzled.<br>
    Picard WALKS OVER to him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the purpose of this gathering<br>
    has eluded me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh? How so?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My thoughts are not for Tasha,<br>
    but for myself. I keep thinking<br>
    how empty it will feel without<br>
    her presence. I missed the point.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, you didn't, Data. You got<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Picard TURNS AND WALKS OFF. WE PULL BACK, leaving Data<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
