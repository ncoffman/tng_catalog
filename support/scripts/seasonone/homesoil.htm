  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Home Soil&quot; </p>
  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - VELARA III IN B.G.</p>
  <p> The ship is ENTERING a parking orbit of the<br>
    yellow-ochre, featureless planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41463.9.<br>
    We are mapping the Pleiades<br>
    Cluster which has many young<br>
    planets and we've been asked by<br>
    the Federation to visit a group<br>
    terraforming Velara III, which<br>
    we would very much like to see.<br>
    Communications have been erratic<br>
    and there is some concern about<br>
    their welfare.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, TROI, TASHA, GEORDI and WORF --<br>
    at their respective stations -- all study Velara III<br>
    on the Main Viewer. As Velara III SETTLES INTO PLACE<br>
    on the Main Viewer:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Entering standard orbit -- now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It takes special people to live<br>
    in such desolation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Visionaries, who don't see this<br>
    planet as it is, but as it will<br>
    be.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've always wanted to see<br>
    terraforming in operation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hailing frequency, Lieutenant Yar.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Hailing frequencies open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Velara III base, this is Captain<br>
    Picard of the starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant Yar... ?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No equipment malfunction on either<br>
    end, sir. They are receiving.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Velara III, this is the Enterprise.<br>
    Come in please.</p>
  <p> Still nothing. Some tense glances among personnel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Maybe nobody's home.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ZOOM IN until WE CAN MAKE OUT the ribbed dome of the<br>
    Terraforming Station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are sensing life-forms, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Velara III, do you copy?</p>
  <p> Then the IMAGE of PROJECT DIRECTOR KURT MANDL APPEARS,<br>
    somewhat disheveled. He is Picard's age, and appears<br>
    to be taken off guard. He could be of German decent,<br>
    somewhat stiff.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Velara Base to Enterprise. Uh...<br>
    yes, Captain. Director Mandl<br>
    here. Sorry for the delay. We<br>
    weren't expecting visitors.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> just enough to ESTABLISH that a small alarm bell is<br>
    ringing, but not enough for a comment.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Terraform Command has asked us<br>
    to see how you were getting along.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    ... We were a little behind, but<br>
    we're back on schedule.</p>
  <p>6 CLOSE ON TROI AND PICARD</p>
  <p> watching and listening intently.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    We alarm him for some reason.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a pause)<br>
    Your staff is all well, I presume,<br>
    Director?</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Understandably tired. We're all<br>
    working very hard, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there anything we can do to<br>
    help?... You and your staff are<br>
    welcome aboard for a change of<br>
    scene and some rest. We have some<br>
    Holodecks you might enjoy.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    No disrespect, sir, we can't<br>
    afford to take the time.</p>
  <p> Troi touches Picard, indicating he should CLICK OFF.<br>
    Picard DOES SO.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    His fear is escalating.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    If you'll excuse me, I must get<br>
    back to work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sense deliberate concealment,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Picard takes it in, concerned.</p>
  <p>7 FEATURING PICARD -- INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> While Picard delivers the following, Mandl seems<br>
    distracted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Of what?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know, but it's intense.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and CLICKS BACK ON.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've heard so much about your<br>
    remarkable achievements in<br>
    terraforming, that my staff would<br>
    very much appreciate looking<br>
    around.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    (hesitant)<br>
    ... It's not really the best time.<br>
    We are at a critical phase just<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We do not require any special<br>
    attention.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    (softer)<br>
    I'm trying not to be rude, sir,<br>
    but it would be inconvenient just<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Pause. Troi signals Picard to CLICK OFF again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's concealing something and it's<br>
    more than just being too busy.<br>
    Your announcement about coming<br>
    down has pushed him almost to the<br>
    point of panic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whether he wants us or not...<br>
    (touching his com)<br>
    Director Mandl, unless you are<br>
    absolutely refusing permission<br>
    for us to land on your station,<br>
    please prepare to receive my<br>
    away team.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    (curtly)<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> Riker, Tasha, Data and Geordi rise and head for the<br>
    door. Worf and another crewmember replace Data and<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stay on your toes, Number One.<br>
    Counselor, perhaps you should go<br>
    along. A man this tense is<br>
    unpredictable.</p>
  <p> Troi rises and JOINS the away team.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TERRAFORMING BASE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Geordi, Troi and Tasha BEAM IN.</p>
  <p> Present in the room are ARTHUR MALENCON, LUISA KIM<br>
    and BJORN BENSEN, Hydraulics Specialist, Biosphere<br>
    Designer and Chief Engineer, respectively. Expecting<br>
    the visitors, Malencon, and Bensen are guarded. Luisa<br>
    on the other hand is friendly and open.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    Welcome to Velara III. Remember<br>
    it as it is now, because in a<br>
    couple of decades you won't recognize<br>
    the place.<br>
    (steps foward)<br>
    Luisa Kim. Gardener of Edens.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander William Riker, USS<br>
    Enterprise. This is Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Data, Counselor Troi,<br>
    Lieutenant Yar and Lieutenant<br>
    La Forge.</p>
  <p> The other two members of the terraforming team<br>
    reluctantly move forward -- both are tense.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    This is Bjorn Bensen, Chief<br>
    Engineer, and Arthur Malencon,<br>
    our Hydraulics Specialist,</p>
  <p> Bensen steps over to Data. He looks him over.</p>
  <p> BENSON<br>
    An android.</p>
  <p> Data nods.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    And third in command of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> After a look of suprise, Bensen takes Data's offered<br>
    hand and examines both sides of it, as if he's checking<br>
    out a new piece of remarkable equipment.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    Where were you manufactured --<br>
    are there others like you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Both matters are subjects of<br>
    protracted discussion.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    Remarkable.</p>
  <p> Bensen turns and joins Malencon at their work. The<br>
    team members take in their surroundings. We are in a<br>
    twenty-fourth century power and hydraulics facility, more<br>
    square-cut and mechanical than the Enterprise. Large,<br>
    working machinery, on which &quot;the bolts show.&quot; The<br>
    computers are more heavy duty and their jumper cables<br>
    show. This room is the hub of the operation, with<br>
    corridors and doors leading off in four different<br>
    directions. Beneath it all is the LOW RUMBLE of<br>
    HYDRAULIC EQUIPMENT at work.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    We don't get visitors. It's<br>
    exciting to have you here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We weren't sure how we would be<br>
    received. Director Mandl seemed<br>
    less than enthusiastic about our<br>
    interest.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    (warmly)<br>
    I should apologize for him. We<br>
    are at a critical phase. Usually<br>
    he's quite charming.</p>
  <p> Riker returns her smile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll stay out of your way, it's<br>
    just that we've never seen a<br>
    terraforming station, and couldn't<br>
    resist the opportunity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    How much do you know about the<br>
    process?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The theories -- the reports -- but<br>
    nothing firsthand.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    Oh, wonderful. Then let me show<br>
    you around.</p>
  <p> As she turns and leads them to a screen, Troi moves<br>
    to Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (sotto voce)<br>
    The other two are as veiled and<br>
    secretive as Mandl, but she is<br>
    not.</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE TO INCLUDE LUISA'S SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the away team watches, the screen SHOWS a lifeless,<br>
    uniformly brown, dead planet.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    What we're doing is so exciting,<br>
    so -- inspiring. We take a<br>
    lifeless planet and little by<br>
    little transform it into an<br>
    M-class environment, capable of<br>
    supporting life. Terraforming<br>
    makes you feel a little godlike.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is that a terribly arrogant thing<br>
    to say?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at all. It is accurate.</p>
  <p>11 INTERCUT</p>
  <p> with REACTIONS and COMMENTS of the away team. During<br>
    this, Luisa seems attracted to Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    The first phase is selecting the<br>
    planet. That's very important.<br>
    It must have the right mass and<br>
    gravity, the correct rate of<br>
    rotation, and a balanced day and<br>
    night. The planet must also be<br>
    without life or having the<br>
    prospect of life delveloping<br>
    naturally. The Federation makes<br>
    that decision. Then...<br>
    (she pauses a beat for<br>
    emphasis)<br>
    ... we take over.</p>
  <p> Riker and the others are taken by her ingenuous<br>
    enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What you see here -- this station<br>
    -- is Phase Two. Phase Three<br>
    involves the water. Usually we<br>
    create basins, using hydraulic<br>
    landscaping, but the water on<br>
    this planet is subsurface, and<br>
    extremely high in salt content.<br>
    We are just about to begin pumping<br>
    and filtering that water,<br>
    removing the salt, oxygenating<br>
    and replacing. Next we introduce<br>
    micro-organisms, and when the<br>
    process is complete...</p>
  <p> Her screen now SHOWS several large separated areas of<br>
    green. The away team exchange looks of admiration.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... eventually, we'll have a<br>
    lush, arable, biosphere.</p>
  <p> While this goes on, Data's attention is caught by<br>
    Malencon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You make it sound poetic.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    (brightly)<br>
    I think it's the best occupation<br>
    in the universe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data CROSSES to Malencon's work station and glances at<br>
    his blueprints.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE - DATA AND MALENCON</p>
  <p> Malencon is working near a computer screen FILLED with<br>
    hydraulics plans -- pipes, sprayers, probes, plans for<br>
    channels, rivers and bays. Geordi STEPS UP beside him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The efficiency of your hydraulic<br>
    landscaping is elegant.</p>
  <p> How could Malencon not be flattered?</p>
  <p> MALENCON<br>
    It isn't yet -- but it will be.<br>
    Right now, I'm disturbed by<br>
    erratic power surges in several<br>
    of the servomechanisms that<br>
    control the hydraulic probes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Could it be the increased<br>
    conductivity caused by the high<br>
    saline content?</p>
  <p> MALENCON<br>
    (with the enthusiasm<br>
    of one scientist to<br>
    another)<br>
    That was my first thought, but..</p>
  <p> Bensen puts a cap on the conversation.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    Arthur.</p>
  <p> Malencon catches himself.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    (continuing; curtly)<br>
    We checked that out. That wasn't<br>
    it.</p>
  <p>13 TROI AND RIKER</p>
  <p> They exchange a glance at this behavior.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Mandl ENTERS the room.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    I'm Director Mandl. I am sorry<br>
    about being so abrupt during our<br>
    initial contact, being isolated<br>
    one tends to forget the social<br>
    graces. Are you seeing everything<br>
    you want?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What you are doing here is<br>
    miraculous.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    What we are doing here is working<br>
    on a difficult, demanding<br>
    timetable, and there will be no<br>
    miracle unless Malencon gets the<br>
    hydraulic probes back on line.<br>
    We are set to step up to full<br>
    conversion, immediately.<br>
    (crisply; to Malencon)<br>
    Shouldn't you be in the hydraulics<br>
    chamber, Arthur?</p>
  <p> Malencon is caught off guard.</p>
  <p> MALENCON<br>
    Now?</p>
  <p>15 TROI</p>
  <p> She picks up on the tension.</p>
  <p>16 MANDL</p>
  <p> He steps toward Malencon for emphasis.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> MALENCON<br>
    (rising, nervous)<br>
    All right, Kurt.</p>
  <p> Malencon HURRIES OUT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker exchange a glance at this behavior.</p>
  <p>18 GEORDI</p>
  <p> indicating Malencon's computer screen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That must be the master subsurface<br>
    pump. Impressive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (indicating another area<br>
    on the computer screen)<br>
    This is interesting. How the<br>
    water table is a thin ribbon<br>
    between the sandy surface layer<br>
    and the rock below.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And it follows the contour precisely.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Which would require extreme<br>
    precision from the probe controls.</p>
  <p> Mandl ENTERS SHOT, on guard as he hears this. He goes<br>
    to the computer and calls up another program.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Here's something which should<br>
    interest you. The vegetation<br>
    graphs are really the key element<br>
    to successful terraforming.</p>
  <p> CAMERA BACK as everyone steps closer to look, except<br>

    Incredible. It's planned month<br>
    by month, decade by decade.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Every single thing we do is<br>
    specific and exacting. You see<br>
    grand, romantic concepts. I see<br>

  <p> She suddenly registers a severe emotional shock.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (overlapping, alarmed)<br>
    Commander... !</p>
  <p> as all hear the alarm in her voice. Her internal<br>
    sensors are scanning the facility.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it, Deanna?</p>
  <p> Her face suddenly registers emotional shock.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (almost in pain)<br>
    Malencon. He's in trouble.</p>
  <p> A perception immediately followed by a WARNING SIREN<br>
    and the o.s. SOUND of LASER BLASTS. Reactions. Riker<br>
    is first OUT of the room, FOLLOWED by Data, Geordi and<br>
    Tasha. Mandl is NEXT, FOLLOWED by Troi. Bensen and<br>
    Luisa, exchanging a look, BRING UP THE REAR.</p>
  <p>20 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HYDRAULICS ROOM</p>
  <p> The o.s. LASER BLASTING is LOUDER, accompanied by<br>
    SHOUTS and CRIES of PAIN by Malencon on the other side<br>
    of the closed door. ANGLE ADJUSTS as Riker and the<br>
    group CONVERGE ON the sliding door. Riker tries the<br>
    handle -- locked. He alone... and then he and Data pull<br>
    at the handles -- no go. Mandl SQUEEZES UP.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you open it?</p>
  <p> Mandl presses the auto-decoder pad, tries the door.<br>
    But it still won't open.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    It's jammed.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Let me try.</p>
  <p> The o.s. SCREAMS STOP. The LASER BLASTS CEASE.<br>
    Reactions: &quot;Is the threat over?&quot; Troi looks sad.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We're too late.</p>
  <p> Mandl tries the auto-decoder pad again, and this time<br>
    the door OPENS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>21 INT. HYDRAULICS ROOM - MANDL'S POV</p>
  <p> The central monitoring column, from which laser arms<br>
    extend and sink laterally into the &quot;surround,&quot; has been<br>
    trashed. On the floor is the equally trashed body of<br>
    Arthur Malencon.</p>
  <p>22 REVERSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> as folks CROWD INTO the doorway. Mandl has a look of<br>
    fear etched across his face. Luisa, very emotional,<br>
    covers her eyes, turns away. Bensen is sick. Our away<br>
    team looks from the body on the floor to Mandl back to<br>
    the body. Tasha stares at Mandl.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental. What<br>
    began as a routine visit to the<br>
    Federation group terraforming<br>
    Velara III has become a serious<br>
    situation. Arthur Malencon, the<br>

    killed in an extraordinary<br>
    accident.</p>
  <p>24 INT. TERRAFORMING BASE - HYDRAULICS ROOM</p>

    a life)<br>
    For safety reasons, we're shutting<br>
    off all power to the hydraulics<br>
    room before entering to recover<br>
    the body. Then we'll beam him<br>
    up to Sickbay, but from the look<br>
    of his wounds, it's probably<br>
    hopeless.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Keep me informed.</p>

  <p>25 INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM/HYDRAULICS ROOM<br>
    (INTERCUT AS DESIRED)</p>
  <p> Geordi stands before an array of computer panels<br>
    examining a display SHOWING the FLOW CHART of the<br>
    operation, AND a DIAGRAM OF THE CROSSED-HUB LAYOUT as<br>
    Bensen works some controls, then nods to Geordi.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    All set.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We have your section powered down<br>
    now. Bensen has locked the master<br>
    servomotor drive system. It<br>
    should be safe in there now.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'm going in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will go with you.</p>
  <p> Data and Tasha ENTER the room, moving to Malencon's<br>
    body. She quickly affixes a communicator to the body,<br>
    touches it, says:</p>

  <p> TASHA<br>
    Transporter Room, this is<br>
    Lieutenant Yar. Two to beam up<br>
    to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Concerned to get the body to Sickbay as soon as<br>
    possible, she waits as she and the body DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>27 BACK TO DOORWAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    I want to go. We should be with<br>
    him.<br>
    (to Mandl)<br>
    Kurt, please come too.</p>
  <p> Mandl shows reluctance, but, seeing the looks on<br>
    everyone's faces, he acquiesces. Riker touches his<br>
    com.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Room, this is<br>
    Commander Riker. Beam up four<br>
    at my coordinates.</p>
  <p> Luisa, Mandl, Troi and Riker DEMATERIALIZE. Data now<br>
    moves into the room proper, prying his way through the<br>
    wreckage.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (on com)<br>
    I have seen malfunctions, but<br>
    this is unprecedented. Almost<br>
    as if the laser drill attempted<br>
    to tear itself apart.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    (off Geordi's look)<br>
    I can't explain it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (into com; reflecting)<br>
    The laser blasts seemed to end<br>
    when the yelling stopped.</p>
  <p> Data goes to the room's computer control console.</p>
  <p> BENSEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Maybe Arthur stopped it -- only<br>
    not in time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not possible.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Then what are you suggesting?</p>
  <p> Data studies at the control panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Uncertain.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Geordi, would you please return<br>
    power to the control console in<br>
    this room. I want to reactivate<br>
    the program.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Bensen do as requested, systematically<br>
    toggling a bank of switches. (END INTERCUT)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>28 DATA'S ANGLE - CONSOLE</p>
  <p> A localized panel LIGHTS UP. Data pushes buttons. The<br>
    laser drill begins its normal functioning. Data<br>
    watches it for a beat as it systematically blasts into<br>
    the bore holes. He then turns his attention back to<br>
    the console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (into com)<br>
    I am running the base drilling<br>
    program.</p>
  <p>29 ANGLES - VARIOUS (MECHANICAL EFFECTS) (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> While Data is preoccupied with the computer program,<br>
    the firing head on the laser drill, lifts and turns<br>
    -- no longer sighting down the bore holes -- it is now<br>
    taking dead aim on Data. The NOISE from the arm alerts<br>
    Data who TURNS and DODGES the BLAST which it WHISTLES<br>
    BY his ear. Again IT FIRES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Servos OFF!</p>
  <p>30 INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM</p>
  <p> Geordi and Bensen scan the panels. Nothing in here has<br>
    changed.</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    They are off!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, what's happening?</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Too much to explain.</p>
  <p>31 OMITTED</p>
  <p>32 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi and Bensen RUN toward Data's location hearing<br>
    the SOUND of LASER BLASTS. Geordi touches the<br>
    Communicator.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    La Forge to Enterprise. We have<br>
    a problem!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>33 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HYDRAULICS ROOM</p>
  <p> The door is closed as Geordi and Bensen RACE TO it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Open the door!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    STAY OUT! It is under control.</p>
  <p> WE HEAR THRASHING, BLASTING, CLATTERING, sounding like<br>
    a battle skirmish. WE PLAY OFF the REACTIONS of Geordi<br>
    and Bensen. They look at each other, astonished,<br>
    unable to comment. Suddenly -- SILENCE.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data --</p>
  <p> For a beat there is no answer. Then the door OPENS.</p>
  <p>34 INT. CORRIDOR - HYDRAULICS ROOM DOOR</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS, FOLLOWED by Bensen, happy to see Data in<br>
    good shape.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are you injured?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p>34A BENSEN'S POV INTO HYDRAULICS ROOM</p>
  <p> He has eyes only for the wreckage that was once<br>
    sophisticated equipment.</p>
  <p>34B BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    A year's work destroyed!</p>

  <p> Picard, Tasha and Geordi are staring at a perfectly<br>
    calm Data. Mandl stands in a corner.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    ... We were attempting to trace<br>
    the source of the malfunction when<br>
    it attacked me.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    How much more of this fantasy must<br>
    I listen to?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    None at all, Mr. Mandl. Until<br>
    this is sorted out, I've provided<br>
    temporary quarters for you and<br>
    your crew. I suggest you use<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    You're overstepping your<br>
    authority, Picard! You have no<br>
    right to interfere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An attack on one of my crew gives<br>
    me the right, Mr. Mandl.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    I have a schedule to meet!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your schedule is on hold, until<br>
    I have a satisfactory explanation<br>
    of what happened.</p>
  <p> Mandl, seeing that argument is useless, turns to exit.<br>
    Picard stops him with:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (crisp)<br>
    Director Mandl. Wait.<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Escort the director to his<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Mandl and Tasha EXIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed with your report.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that the laser<br>
    drilling systems had been<br>
    reprogrammed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    As soon as its memory bank<br>
    received power, it turned itself<br>
    on and went after me.<br>
    Fortunately, I was able to cope<br>
    with it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (bank shot)<br>
    Not by much, from what I saw.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it was programmed to<br>
    destroy any person moving in that<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Speculation or certainty?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It would have required the talents<br>
    of a master programmer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But it was done.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then the question is not who,<br>
    because obviously it was one of<br>
    the three remaining terraformers.<br>
    The question is why. What are<br>
    they hiding? What is so important<br>
    it could make one of them, or all<br>
    of them desperate enough to take<br>
    a life?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shall I have them brought in, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not yet.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and they FOLLOW him to:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>36 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as they RETURN FROM the Ready Room. Riker, Tasha, Troi<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Malencon never had a chance.<br>
    The injuries were too severe, the<br>
    damage too extensive.</p>
  <p> Picard nods sadly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The entire Velara III facility<br>
    has been powered down, Captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We've just completed a remote<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Data, I want you and Geordi<br>
    to return for a more careful<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    What are we to look for, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Evidence of tampering, negligence,<br>

    know, but the answer's there, on<br>
    the planet.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi EXIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Tasha, I'd like you to provide<br>
    Counselor Troi and me with<br>
    complete personnel files on our<br>

    one murder and attempt another.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Riker reacts, not enjoying the forecast.</p>
  <p>37 INT. HYDRAULICS ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> DIM interior ILLUMINATION filters in through the<br>
    translucent dome. Data and Geordi MATERIALIZE among<br>
    the apparently inert junk. They move cautiously at<br>
    first, but everything does seem to be inert.</p>
  <p>38 VARIOUS ANGLES</p>
  <p> as Data probes among the junk. Then, eventually, he<br>
    examines the opening to the tubular tunnel which had<br>
    been occupied by one of the sensor arms.</p>
  <p>39 POV - SMALL FLASHES</p>
  <p> It doesn't last for more than half a second at a time,<br>

  <p>40 ANGLE - DATA</p>
  <p> Unaccustomedly startled, he draws back. He looks<br>
    around to make sure nothing else is happening. Then,<br>
    he gets close and looks again. ANOTHER BLINK or two.<br>
    He scans the little thing with his tricorder. Nothing.<br>
    Shaking his head, he touches his communicator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi. I need some visual<br>
    assistance.</p>
  <p>41 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Geordi JOINS him. Data indicates the &quot;rice grain,&quot;<br>
    BLINKING in a rapid, non-repetitive pattern, looking<br>
    like HIGH SPEED MORSE CODE in LIGHTS, with pauses and<br>
    breaks, like language syntax.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> With a very puzzled look at Data and the lights and<br>
    back again, Geordi applies his Tricorder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Inorganic. Nothing but basic<br>
    elements. No carbon... sandy<br>
    texture... But the flashes are<br>
    almost... musical. I see color<br>
    variations and rhythms which are<br>
    like a melody.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Speculation. Could it be alive?</p>
  <p>42 CLOSE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> stunned. He looks down at the FLASHING LIGHT.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How could it be alive? It's<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Whatever this is, it could be<br>
    what they are covering up -- and<br>
    the reason someone killed<br>
    Malencon.</p>
  <p> As though in answer, the &quot;rice grain&quot; BLINKS FASTER,<br>

    Understandable, given this<br>
    particular life-form's novel<br>
    nature.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    And just what is that nature?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher is still making<br>
    her determination.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I presume you know the Prime<br>
    Directive, Mr. Mandl.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Are you saying I knowingly defied<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know. But I intend to<br>
    find out.<br>
    (level beat)<br>
    You're a man obsessed with what<br>
    he does. Who knows what an<br>
    obsessed man would do to keep<br>
    going? Kill, perhaps?</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    (exploding:)<br>
    I create life! I don't take it!</p>
  <p> Mandl STORMS FROM the room. Tasha FOLLOWS him. A pause,<br>
    and then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You hit him pretty hard, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was useful.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I felt two levels. He knew about<br>
    the life-form. The idea of murder<br>
    seemed to shock him. I couldn't<br>
    tell if it was the whole idea,<br>
    or just being accused of it.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about his file, Lieutenant<br>
    Yar? Could he have accomplished<br>
    the reprogramming that Data says<br>
    took place?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Mandl holds advanced degrees in<br>
    Computer Science as well as<br>
    Artificial Intelligence. It's<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about the others? Including<br>
    the victim.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Only the victim had the required<br>
    expertise. But Malencon did work<br>
    where the... whatever-it-is...<br>
    was found. Trying to suppress<br>
    that knowledge would be motive<br>
    for murder... if Mandl were<br>
    obsessed enough.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Terraformers are often obsessive.<br>
    It goes with the career profile.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you read the designer?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> She is lying on her sofa, her arm over her eyes. She<br>
    wears a tasteful robe. There is a gentle KNOCK on the<br>
    door. She seems not to hear it.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Luisa... are you all right?</p>
  <p> She seems reassured by his voice. She sits up and<br>

  <p> She shakes her head and indicates a comfortable seat.<br>
    He sinks into it. She looks at him, on the edge of<br>
    hysteria. Just the edge. She is about to become<br>
    either the world's greatest liar or its greatest<br>
    innocent.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    Is it true... did you really find<br>
    a life-form?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's still being debated in some<br>
    quarters. But I think so, yes.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    What's it like?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have nothing to compare it to,<br>
    but it's microscopic... seems<br>
    colonial... simple... and<br>
    inorganic.<br>
    (gentle)<br>
    That's why the recon scouts missed<br>
    it. This one wasn't your mistake.</p>
  <p> She rises and faces him.</p>

    Everything I've worked for is<br>
    falling apart.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's very beautiful. I'll arrange<br>
    for you to see it, if you like.</p>

    Without external influence.</p>

  <p> Geordi suddenly reacts to something he alone is seeing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's changing.</p>
  <p> They all move close to the Jar. Their faces almost<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That chaos in the lab, when we<br>
    were studying it... must have<br>
    been the energy surge of a<br>
    reproductive cycle.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is now a colony of single cells<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    We've stumbled on a life-form...</p>
  <p>80 INT. MEDICAL LAB</p>
  <p> on the bell jar and the golf ball cluster of &quot;grains&quot;<br>
    contained within. There is a LIGHT FLICKER from the<br>
    life-form as:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... biologically and<br>
    psychologically difficult for<br>
    us to fully understand.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The only thing totally clear is<br>
    that this microbrain, as we've<br>
    come to call it, has declared war<br>
    on us.</p>
  <p>81 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ANGLES (FORMERLY SCENE 83)</p>
  <p> Everyone at their stations.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their range of influence appears<br>
    to be concentrated in the Medical<br>
    Lab, Captain.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    All non-essential personnel have<br>
    been moved to the most distant<br>
    areas of the ship, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data -- any analysis of those<br>
    bolts of light they emit?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That seems to be their method of<br>
    reprogramming, Captain. Each bolt<br>
    of light consists of negatively<br>
    and positively charged ions. A<br>
    series of program instructions,<br>
    as it were.<br>
    (disturbed)<br>
    They seem to have a quicker<br>
    rapport with our computers than<br>
    we do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What do you expect? They are<br>
    computers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have we disabled the Medical Lab<br>
    computer console?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir, as soon as Data<br>
    determined the microbrain's method<br>
    of operation.</p>
  <p>82 OMITTED</p>
  <p>82A ANGLE</p>

    Maybe the life-form has reached<br>
    its own energy limit.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Or maybe this is not the end of<br>
    it.<br>
    (at their looks)<br>
    With single-celled life-forms...<br>
    at least organic ones, cell<br>
    division can be preceded by a<br>

    The calm before the storm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's use the calm. Medical Lab<br>

  <p>86 MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WE CAN SEE THE bell jar on its pedestal in the Lab.<br>
    The golf ball cluster of &quot;grains&quot; is BARELY FLICKERING.<br>
    No rays, no bolts of light.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It does seem dormant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Yar - set coordinates<br>
    to beam it back where it came<br>
    from.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>

    Coordinates set.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize!</p>
  <p> She hits the button. WE GET the SOUND OF THE<br>
    TRANSPORTER. The BEAM even COMES PART WAY toward the<br>
    bell jar and its microbrain occupant. But the damn<br>
    thing won't dematerialize.</p>
  <p>87 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> EXCLUDING the viewscreen. Riker reads a console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter power has been<br>
    redirected, sir. We are unable<br>
    to affect it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life-form or not... intelligent<br>
    or not -- the safety of this ship<br>
    and all on her are my primary<br>
    responsibility.<br>
    (moment, and:)<br>
    Data -- evacuate the air from the<br>
    Medical Lab. I want a vacuum in<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> Data punches in the command... reads his panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Environmental systems fail to<br>
    respond to commands, Captain.<br>
    It appears the microbrain has<br>
    successfully interfaced with our<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> Picard considers his alternatives.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Suggestions?<br>
    (silence)<br>
    Anyone?</p>
  <p>88 OMITTED</p>
  <p>88A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - ESTABLISHING<br>
    (FORMERLY SCENES 81 AND 82)</p>
  <p> Picard, Data and Beverly are with Mandl, Luisa, and<br>
    Bensen. The lounge viewscreen will eventually put<br>
    referenced IMAGES ON A SCREEN.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need your help. We have<br>
    communicated with the life-form<br>
    discovered on Velara III.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    You have what?!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It has told us that it attempted<br>
    to communicate with you, and you<br>
    ignored it.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    If it was trying to communicate<br>
    with us, we didn't understand<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>88A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BENSEN<br>
    We didn't try.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What you were doing was so<br>
    threatening to them that they<br>
    killed your hydraulics engineer<br>
    to stop it. They have declared<br>
    a state of war.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    A state of war?!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, and we're on the defensive.<br>
    I need your help. I have to find<br>
    some way to fight them. We no<br>
    longer have control of the Medical<br>
    Lab, or the computer. At this<br>
    moment they have the power to<br>
    destroy this ship and everyone<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    Unbelievable. What can we do<br>
    to help?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They said you killed some of them.<br>
    I need to know how.</p>
  <p> MANDL<br>
    I -- I don't know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly what was Malencon doing<br>
    when he was killed?</p>
  <p> Luisa responds.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    There is a very thin layer of<br>
    highly saline water under the<br>
    sandy topsoil. He was siphoning<br>
    that off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why would that kill some of them?</p>
  <p> For a beat no one has an answer.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Liquid supports life. Perhaps<br>
    somehow, that saline water<br>
    sustained them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>88A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It connected them.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The microbrains are like our brain<br>
    cells. Individually a cell has<br>
    life -- but not intelligence -- yet<br>
    when interconnected their combined<br>
    intelligence is formidable.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    So that saline fluid is their<br>
    circuitry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And to prevent its loss, they<br>
    killed Malencon.</p>
  <p> LUISA<br>
    (depressed)<br>
    If we had continued to remove the<br>
    water... we would have destroyed<br>
    them all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reason enough for anyone to go<br>
    to war.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain -- it's happening again!</p>
  <p>89 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PULL BACK from Main Viewer to SEE the recently dormant<br>
    GOLF BALL starting to GLOW again. The GLOW is STEADY<br>
    and POWERFUL. WE ALSO SEE A QUIVERING of the surface.<br>
    But then the entire image is SHROUDED in LIGHT,<br>
    OBSCURING OUR VIEW. The bell jar suddenly RUPTURES.<br>
    The LIGHT DIMINISHES. Everyone is at their stations.<br>
    Luisa, Bensen and Mandl are also present.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If this keeps up, that thing will<br>
    tear the Enterprise apart!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Home Soil&quot; - 12/2/87 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain -- sensors indicate the<br>
    microbrain expends a tremendous<br>
    amount of energy during its<br>
    reproduction cycle. Yet, there<br>
    is no discernible power drain from<br>
    our own systems.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what's feeding the damn<br>
    thing!?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data and I found traces of<br>
    cadmium salts. Cadmium is a<br>
    conduit for converting infra-red<br>
    into electricity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meaning?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Meaning the microbrains might be<br>
    photoelectric.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Okay, let's see if darkness will<br>
    neutralize them. Kill the lights<br>
    in the lab, Mr. La Forge. We can<br>
    at least do that.</p>
  <p> Geordi tries, but to no avail.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sorry, Captain, can't do it by<br>
    remote.</p>

    The creatures must have evolved<br>
