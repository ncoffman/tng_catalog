    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS the corridor as he is PAGED.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker, report to the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On the way.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Riker HURRIES to the turbolift. HARRY, a smallish<br>
    ten-year-old boy, runs down the corridor, head down,<br>
    colliding with Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's your hurry, Harry?</p>
  <p> Harry looks up at him, not believing what he's done.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    Oops. Sorry, Commander. I was,<br>
    um, just...</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    Harry!</p>
  <p> Harry's father, HARRY BERNARD, SR., APPEARS and is<br>
    furious with his son.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    I'm sorry if he bothered you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No bother, Doctor Bernard.</p>
  <p> Riker limps slightly as he walks toward the turbolift.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    I'm not going back. I hate that<br>
    teacher. And I hate calculus.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    Everyone needs an understanding<br>
    of basic calculus, whether they<br>
    like it or not.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Riker REACTS to Harry's question with a smile.</p>
  <p>3 RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> From inside the turbolift, Riker watches Dr. Bernard<br>
    take his son by the hand and lead him back down the<br>
    corridor as the turbolift doors CLOSE.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker LIMPS OFF the turbolift. PICARD is at the Aft<br>
    Station. The other CREWMEMBERS are at their positions.<br>
    BEVERLY is also at the Aft Station.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're limping.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A small run-in with an aspiring<br>
    sprinter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A problem, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A curiosity. For the past several<br>
    hours we have been tracking faint<br>
    energy readings in an attempt to<br>
    locate the source. It's been like<br>
    following a trail of bread crumbs.</p>
  <p> Riker steps over to the Aft Station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The path lead here and stopped<br>
    -- which is what I knew would<br>
    interest you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    What's our position?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Epsilon Mynos system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with a look of<br>
    surprise)<br>
    Really? Thank you, Captain;<br>
    you're right... I wouldn't miss<br>
    this for anything.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What's so interesting about this<br>
    system?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aldea.</p>
  <p> Tasha still doesn't get the point.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; to Tasha)<br>
    Tasha -- I'm surprised. You mean<br>
    you've never heard the stories<br>
    about Aldea? A wonderous mythical<br>
    world -- like Atlantis on ancient<br>
    earth... or Neinman on Xerxes<br>
    Seven... with an advanced culture,<br>
    centuries old. Self-contained,<br>
    peaceful, with incredible<br>
    technical sophistication which<br>
    provided for every citizen's daily<br>
    needs, allowing them to devote<br>
    themselves to culture and art,<br>
    which was beautiful beyond compare<br>
    and valued beyond price.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Where is it supposed to be?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ahh -- that is the myth -- somehow --<br>
    so the legend goes -- the Aldeans<br>
    were able to cloak their planet<br>
    in darkness and go unseen by<br>
    marauders and other hostile<br>
    passersby who might rob and<br>
    plunder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Tasha LAUGHS.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    A wonderful fairy tale.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scanners still show nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> Troi is concentrating, puzzled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Scanners may show nothing,<br>
    Captain, but I am sensing<br>
    something very strong.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Thousands of minds, sir.</p>
  <p>5 VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE CREW</p>
  <p> REACTING with interest and curiosity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Very close.</p>
  <p>6 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All stop.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Answering all stop.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anything?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am recording a<br>
    distortion in quadrant one, mark<br>
    nine-zero.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There is nothing specifically visible on the Main<br>
    Viewer, except a SLIGHT BLURRING in the center.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 REACTIONS</p>
  <p> as the crew puzzles over the unusual effect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shields and deflectors up.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>9 BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suddenly, with a great, low-decibel NOISE like<br>
    BLANKETED THUNDER, which draws everyone's attention, a<br>
    huge planet begins to APPEAR on the viewer, clearing<br>
    until it's visible. It is a LIGHT GREEN, peaceful and<br>
    inviting, necklaced with a LIGHT FILM. Everyone stands<br>
    amazed, in awe.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (almost breathless)<br>
    Aldea, Captain... It has to be.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she maintains orbit around Aldea.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41509.1.<br>
    Either by chance or intent, we've<br>
    been led to the mythical planet<br>
    of Aldea, which appeared out of<br>
    nowhere, hidden behind a<br>
    sophisticated shielding device.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everyone is at stations.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, the sensors indicate that<br>
    the shield is electromagnetic. A<br>
    complicated light refracting<br>
    mechanism.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A cloaking device.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To hide an entire planet it's<br>
    gotta be pretty sophisticated.</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Troi watch the planet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (from Aft Station)<br>
    We're being scanned, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's let them know our peaceful<br>
    intent. Open hailing frequencies,<br>
    Lieutenant Yar.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Before Tasha can comply, a WOMAN'S IMAGE MATERIALIZES<br>
    on the viewscreen, startling everyone. RASHELLA, a<br>
    melancholy beauty with almost translucent skin, is<br>
    shrouded in DIM LIGHT. She emanates a quiet tensile<br>
    strength, her body covered by the simplest utilitarian<br>
    clothes.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    I'm Rashella. Welcome to Aldea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the USS Enterprise. We come in<br>
    peace.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    We know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've heard the stories about<br>
    Aldea, but frankly never thought<br>
    they could possibly be true.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    Our shield has confused outsiders<br>
    for millennia, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A very long time to have that kind<br>
    of technology. Why are you<br>
    revealing yourself now?</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    We're eager to meet in person to<br>
    discuss that, and other subjects<br>
    of mutual interest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're ready anytime.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    Excellent!</p>
  <p> Instantly, THREE ALDEANS MATERIALIZE on the bridge.<br>
    The crew is stunned. Rashella; GAREN, a large<br>
    fierce-looking man; and behind them, RADUE, pale,<br>
    older, stately-looking, with great authority and kindly<br>
    eyes, and a squint at the brightness of the bridge.<br>
    They carry baskets filled with fruits and flowers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> REACTIONS from the bridge personnel. All are taken<br>
    aback.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    (reacting to their<br>
    astonishment)<br>
    Our arrival seems to have startled<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    We mean no harm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was a little sudden</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    I'm Radue, First Appointee of Aldea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, they haven't been through<br>
    decontamination.</p>
  <p> Picard waves her off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's all right.<br>
    (to the Aldeans)<br>
    Our medical doctor is concerned<br>
    you didn't go through our regular<br>
    transporting procedure.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    You couldn't transport us. The<br>
    only way through our shield is<br>
    our way, Captain. Our cloaking<br>
    device may be off, but our shield<br>
    is operating. We've brought you<br>
    small tokens of welcome.</p>
  <p> She hands Picard a basket of flowers and bows her head<br>
    to him slightly, then gestures to Garen, who offers his<br>
    basket of fruit to Tasha.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    And our personal invitation to<br>
    a celebration on Aldea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'd be delighted. Number One,<br>
    assemble your away team.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    We will prepare for your arrival,<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How did you know...</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    ... your name? We've been<br>
    monitoring your ship's<br>
    communications. We must return<br>
    now to Aldea. Our eyes are very<br>
    sensitive to bright light.<br>
    Rashella, Garen.</p>
  <p> They use their arm devices and the three DISAPPEAR<br>
    from the bridge. Picard looks at Troi and Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Amazing. Only to exist in<br>
    mythology and suddenly they're<br>
    here, right in front of us.<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now you know who placed the<br>
    bread crumbs. We're not here by<br>
    accident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor? What do you sense?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Only the obvious. They want<br>
    something from us.</p>
  <p> RADUE'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker, is your party<br>
    ready?</p>
  <p> The away team, not as normally constituted, DISAPPEARS<br>
    off the bridge. It includes only Riker, Troi and<br>
    Beverly, selected by the Aldeans. Picard looks around<br>
    at who is missing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Interesting choices.</p>
  <p>13 INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The away team MATERIALIZES in a spartan, white-walled<br>
    room with ancient hanging tapestries.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> (From now on, throughout the script, every room on Aldea<br>
    has a Teleporting Arch which allows the Aldeans to move<br>
    from place to place on their planet simply by stepping<br>
    in and identifying their destination.) Rashella, Radue<br>
    and DUANA, an older woman who is very pale and slight,<br>
    greet them.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    I hope Duana and I know how to<br>
    greet you properly, Commander.<br>
    &quot;May your light shine through the<br>
    ages.&quot;</p>
  <p> Radue's hand begins to shake uncontrollably.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My apologies. Age has no respect<br>
    for the body.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Troi exchange worried glances.</p>
  <p>14 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WESLEY has joined Picard on the bridge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How do they cloak the planet?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The theory is simple. The shield<br>
    bends light rays around the<br>
    planet's contour -- similar to the<br>
    Romulan cloaking device -- but the<br>
    implementation is very difficult.</p>
  <p> A BEAM OF ENERGY PENETRATES the bridge at that moment.<br>
    It searches until it finds Wesley, then SURROUNDS him.<br>
    He can't move away from it. He closes his eyes and<br>
    relaxes into it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, the energy beam is<br>
    originating from Aldea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shields up. La Forge, contact<br>
    Commander Riker. Worf, check<br>
    all other decks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Shields inoperable, sir. All<br>
    decks are being probed in a<br>
    methodical pattern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All decks? Everything? The entire<br>
    ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, I can't get through to<br>
    Commander Riker. We're being<br>
    blocked.</p>
  <p> The ENERGY BEAM STOPS as suddenly as it appeared.<br>
    Wesley shakes his head, as if to brush it off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you all right, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    It was scary at first, but I<br>
    really didn't feel anything.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, similar incidents, all decks,<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    but only with the children.</p>
  <p>15 INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The hosts are getting down to business as they all sit<br>
    around a table laden with food.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Yes, Commander, we are an ancient<br>
    power. But we've suffered for<br>
    it. Our history is littered with<br>
    the deaths of those people who<br>
    craved more and more things.<br>
    Nothing was ever enough. So,<br>
    we've evolved a very simple way<br>
    of living: for whatever is taken,<br>
    something is given in return.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It seems an equitable code.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    It's given us peace.<br>
    Unfortunately, there are very few<br>
    of us left to enjoy it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    That is some of what we wish to<br>
    discuss. We need help from the<br>
    Federation to rebuild our<br>
    heritage... we need a younger<br>
    generation, strong and healthy,<br>
    following in the Aldean<br>
    traditions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't understand. How can the<br>
    Federation help influence your<br>
    children in your traditions?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Because we have no children,<br>
    Commander. Rashella was the last<br>
    child born on this planet.</p>
  <p> Rashella watches the away team for its reaction. They're<br>
    shocked.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And your medical community can<br>
    do nothing?</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    They've tried, Doctor Crusher.<br>
    And failed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Perhaps we can help...</p>
  <p> Troi senses something ominous and makes a signal to<br>
    Riker who quickly and correctly interprets it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Radue, exactly why have we been<br>
    invited to Aldea?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    We propose a trade. One which<br>
    will solve our problem and give<br>
    something back to the Federation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the nature of this trade?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    We need some of your children.<br>
    In payment, we will give you the<br>
    kind of knowledge which would take<br>
    you centuries to acquire.</p>
  <p>16 REACTIONS</p>
  <p> from Riker, Beverly and Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That might be acceptable to some<br>
    other races, but humans are<br>
    unusually attached to their own<br>
    offspring.</p>
  <p>17 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We sympathize with your situation,<br>
    Radue. But what you ask is not<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    And that's your final answer?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's my only answer. If we can<br>
    be of help in some other way...</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    I am sorry you are intransigent.</p>
  <p> Radue nods at Rashella and touches his arm band. The<br>
    three Enterprise officers are immediately GONE from the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p>18 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised when the away team abruptly APPEARS<br>
    on the bridge. As Wesley turns in reaction, a BEAM<br>
    ENGULFS him and he DISAPPEARS from the bridge.<br>
    Beverly's anguished face is stunned as she reaches out<br>
    to the empty place where he was standing.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Harm has already been done.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Captain, let us begin discussions<br>

    compensation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (angrily)<br>
    Compensation! You steal our<br>
    children -- from their classrooms<br>
    -- their bedrooms -- and you talk<br>
    about compensation. Return<br>
    them... now!</p>

    We will continue this discussion<br>
    when you've calmed down.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen GOES BLACK.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I shouldn't have lost my temper.</p>
  <p> He and Beverly exchange looks. Their faces are tight.</p>
  <p>25 INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER</p>
  <p> Wesley stands in the middle of the room with most of<br>
    the children huddled around him. He watches Harry<br>
    wander around, looking at the tapestries on the wall,<br>
    while Alexandra toddles aimlessly.</p>
  <p> KATIE<br>
    Wesley, I'm frightened.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know. We all are, but it's<br>
    going to be all right. Everyone<br>
    knows where we are. No one is<br>
    going to hurt you. I promise.<br>
    (then to the toddler)<br>
    Alexandra, don't go too far!</p>
  <p> KATIE<br>
    She's not afraid of anything.</p>
  <p> Harry feels the texture of a magnificent wall-hanging.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Harry, don't touch that!</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    I'm not gonna hurt it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know that. But maybe they<br>
    don't.</p>
  <p> All the children move closer together.</p>
  <p> KATIE<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> Wesley runs after Alexandra. He holds onto her hand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know who.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    Why are we here?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know that either.</p>
  <p> The children suddenly realize there is someone watching<br>
    them. Radue SWEEPS majestically INTO the room,<br>
    Rashella and Duana FOLLOWING. He stares at the<br>
    children. Wesley steps forward in front of the group<br>
    and stares back at Radue.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Greetings, Wesley Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How did you know my name?<br>
    (realization)<br>
    Oh, through that energy beam.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Excellent analysis. The Custodian<br>
    indicated you would be the leader.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Custodian -- who is the<br>
    Custodian?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    The Custodian is not a person.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    We have brought you to Aldea as<br>
    our guests. We'll provide<br>
    anything you need or want.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We want to go home.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Wesley, all of you have been<br>
    chosen because you are special.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Children, we are starting on a<br>
    wonderful adventure.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Exactly... Just ask for anything<br>
    you want, and you shall have it.</p>
  <p> Radue WHISKS OUT of the room, leaving the children more<br>
    confused than they were before. Alexandra follows him<br>
    to the door and waves.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDRA<br>
    Bye-bye.</p>
  <p> Rashella looks down at this creature and can't help but<br>
    smile. She reaches out her hand and Alexandra smiles<br>
    and takes it.</p>
  <p>26 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard stands in front of a table where the children's<br>
    tense, hostile parents sit with Troi. TOYA stands<br>
    defiantly, like an Amazon facing the only enemy she can<br>
    find.</p>
  <p> TOYA<br>
    What happened to Alexandra and<br>
    the other children, Captain? How<br>
    are you getting them back?</p>
  <p> Beverly gently rebukes Toya.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Toya, sit down... You're<br>
    reacting out of fear.<br>
    (gently)<br>
    We all knew what the risks were<br>
    when we signed on. And that's<br>
    the choice we made. Captain<br>
    Picard will do everything possible<br>
    to bring our children back.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges Beverly's support.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Aldeans are anxious to discuss<br>
    &quot;compensation.&quot; That will buy<br>
    us time. I've asked Doctor<br>
    Crusher to be involved in the<br>
    negotiations as your<br>
    representative.</p>
  <p> The parents MURMUR. Picard looks around the table at<br>
    his frightened personnel.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    Why were these specific children<br>
    taken?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't be sure. We do know the<br>
    Aldeans can't have children of<br>
    their own.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    Then they won't let them go<br>
    easily.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I won't insult you by pretending<br>
    it will be easy. I can only say<br>
    the Enterprise will not leave them<br>
    behind. Be assured of that.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    Can we talk with our children?<br>
    Give them some reassurance. Let<br>
    them know that we are here, and<br>
    that they will be safe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will do my best to arrange it.</p>
  <p> Toya and the others do their best to believe Picard.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    The last time I saw him I yelled<br>
    at him.</p>
  <p> They all understand his pain.</p>
  <p>27 INT. ALDEA - RASHELLA'S QUARTERS</p>

    her head around a corner. Rashella JUMPS OUT of<br>

  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have you now!</p>
  <p>28 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS the bridge from the lounge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any response from Aldea,<br>
    Lieutenant Yar?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Not yet, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, Data has found something<br>
    interesting. The Aldean shield<br>
    gives evidence of sporadic<br>
    fluctuations, weakening its<br>
    structure in isolated sections.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're saying there are holes in<br>
    their defense system?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In essence, yes. It is surprising<br>
    after all these eons that the<br>
    Aldeans' use of their technology<br>
    is not perfect. One would assume<br>
    they would be aware of the<br>
    weakness and repair it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we beam down an away team<br>
    through one of these so-called<br>
    holes?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is a possibility. It would<br>
    have to be perfectly timed -- and<br>
    there are no guarantees.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We may be more successful in<br>
    deciphering the code they use<br>
    to transport through the magnetic<br>
    shield.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you do that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Eventually, sir. I am working<br>
    on it now but the number of<br>
    permutations is almost endless.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep trying.<br>
    (turning to Riker)<br>
    Number One, while he's doing that,<br>
    you find a way of getting through<br>
    one of those holes because one way<br>
    or the other we have to get an away<br>
    team on that planet, locate the<br>
    power source of that shield and<br>
    neutralize it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're certain they'll negotiate?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, they'll negotiate, Number One.<br>
    Or call it that. They took what<br>
    they wanted, now they'll<br>
    rationalize it by throwing us some<br>
    sort of bone.</p>
  <p> Data is puzzled by this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A bone, sir? In exchange for the<br>
    children?</p>
  <p> Picard just looks at him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Oh. A metaphor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And when we don't accept their<br>
    offer?</p>

  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The minute they believe we will<br>
    accept no compensation for the<br>
    children, they will end all<br>
    discussion and disappear behind<br>
    their shield... locking us out<br>
    and the children in -- forever.<br>
    That's why I have to keep them<br>
    talking.</p>
  <p>29 INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER FOYER</p>
  <p> Wesley, Katie and Harry are sitting in the hallway,<br>
    waiting. Tara COMES OUT of the room with an ALDEAN<br>

    back at the boys, pleadingly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Excuse me, sir, where are you<br>
    taking Tara?</p>
  <p> They continue walking down the hall, leaving Wesley<br>
    behind. Harry turns accusingly to Wesley.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    What's happening? I thought you<br>
    said the captain was going to<br>
    rescue us!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He will. It just might take him<br>
    a little while.</p>

    They hesitate.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>

  <p> THREE other ADULT ALDEANS are waiting inside. They are<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Like a family.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Yes, you could call it that.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> LEDA<br>
    We have been waiting for you so<br>

  <p> RADUE<br>
    Katie.</p>
  <p> Katie steps forward to meet MELIAN, a middle-aged<br>
    Aldean, very distinguished looking. Melian reaches<br>
    out his arthritic, crippled hand to clasp Katie's.</p>
  <p> MELIAN<br>
    I am honored.</p>
  <p> KATIE<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Melian is the foremost musician<br>
    on Aldea.</p>
  <p> MELIAN<br>
    Music speaks its own language...<br>
    I know we'll have much to learn<br>
    from each other.</p>
  <p> Katie looks at Wesley.</p>
  <p> MELIAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't worry, Katie. You'll be<br>
    seeing Wesley soon.</p>
  <p> He puts his arm around Katie and takes her OUT OF FRAME.<br>
    Wesley stands alone, almost defiant. He stares at Radue,<br>
    forcing him to speak first.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    We're the only ones left, Wesley.<br>
    Does that tell you something?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Do you want me to guess?</p>
  <p> DUANE<br>
    No. You'll be staying with Radue<br>
    and me. As First Unit we require<br>
    someone with innate leadership<br>
    ability -- and a great mind. You<br>
    have both. We need you, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What about me? Don't I have a<br>
    say in this?</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Wesley, sometimes things happen<br>
    which we just must accept. You<br>
    and the other children are now<br>
    members of this society. That<br>
    will not change. It's up to you<br>
    to make the transition as easy<br>
    as possible for the others. You<br>
    are their leader. It's your duty.<br>
    Help them accept it -- because<br>
    nothing you, or those on the<br>
    starship can do will change it.<br>
    Because like you, we also have<br>
    no choice.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    We'll do our best to see you're<br>
    happy here. And I promise you<br>
    one thing: the secrets of Aldea's<br>

  <p> Before he can answer, Alexandra BURSTS INTO the room,<br>

    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher and I are ready,<br>
    Radue.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Are you ill, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Doctor Crusher is a Staff<br>
    Officer, Radue. Starfleet<br>
    Regulation 6.57 requires at least<br>
    two staff officers to be present<br>
    during any treaty or contract<br>
    negotiations.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Very well.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Neither am I, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Oh. I see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Crusher, report to the<br>

    have in mind.</p>
  <p>35 INT. ALDEA - COMPUTER (CUSTODIAN) ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Duana and Wesley APPEAR in the Teleporting Arch, which<br>
    has a DISTINCTIVE SOUND. The room is very simple. It<br>
    doesn't look as advanced as the Enterprise's computer.<br>
    Wesley looks around, unimpressed. He notices a massive<br>
    door at the end of the room that looks as though it's<br>
    never been opened.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Over here, Wesley.</p>
  <p> Wesley moves to a table in the center of the room.<br>
    Duana speaks into a panel.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Custodian, Wesley Crusher's voice<br>
    will be entered into the<br>
    authorized file -- for Third Level<br>
    clearance.</p>
  <p> CUSTODIAN VOICE<br>
    Proceed, Duana.</p>
  <p> Wesley listens to the sounds and speed of the<br>
    Custodian.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Announce yourself to the<br>
    Custodian.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hello, Custodian. I'm Wesley<br>
    Crusher.</p>

    Hello, Wesley. Your voice will<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you. What does that mean?</p>
  <p> CUSTODIAN VOICE<br>
    You may ask any questions you<br>
    wish.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you. Duana, what does the<br>
    Custodian do?</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    It frees us from all burden. It<br>
    takes care of all our needs. It<br>
    regulates our lives.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Who built it?</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    The Progenitors.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    When?</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Before my time. Centuries ago.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    ... What's its power source?</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Wesley, why is that important?<br>
    It does what we ask it. It always<br>
    has. What difference does it make<br>
    how it works?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    If you don't know how it works,<br>
    how can you repair it?</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    (not understanding the<br>
    concept)<br>
    Why would we want to repair it?</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    From time to time, every computer<br>
    -- I mean Custodian -- requires<br>
    maintainance.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    Wesley, Radue is right. You ask<br>
    questions I can't answer. Ask<br>
    the Custodian instead.</p>
  <p> Wesley leans towards the terminal.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Custodian, can you show me where<br>
    Harry is?</p>
  <p> CUSTODIAN VOICE<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Show me Harry.</p>
  <p> A small screen ACTIVATES in the center of the console.<br>
    Wesley watches:</p>
  <p>36 INT. ALDEA - ARTISTS' UNIT</p>
  <p> A workshop that's an artist's dream. Tools of every<br>
    kind, small and large, ancient and modern. Leda is<br>
    showing Harry the use of an unusual shaped<br>
    wood-sculpting tool. Harry watches her work with awe.<br>
    She hands him the tool, and he repeats what she did<br>
    with only a little difficulty. Leda's pleasure shows<br>
    in her face. She pats Harry on the shoulder as he<br>
    continues working. He looks up at her happily.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    I never did this before. It's<br>
    fun.</p>
  <p>37 INT. ALDEA - CUSTODIAN ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Harry and Leda are still ON THE SCREEN.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You are going to make Harry into<br>
    a sculptor?</p>

  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    He already is. He has just never<br>
    been encouraged properly. The<br>
    tool Leda is giving him will allow<br>
    him to bring out his visions.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It will take years for him to<br>
    learn to do that.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Oh, no. It will happen quite<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, wonderingly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Custodian, show me Alexandra.</p>
  <p> Wesley watches.</p>
  <p>38 INT. ALDEA - RASHELLA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Rashella is demonstrating to Alexandra how to use a<br>
    Plexiglas-type multidimensional set of blocks designed<br>
    to enhance her reasoning ability. Rashella is thrilled<br>
    that Alexandra repeats what she's been shown -- and then<br>
    some. She pushes some buttons and the SHAPES AND<br>
    COLORS CHANGE. Alexandra GIGGLES and looks to Rashella<br>
    for approval. Rashella gives her a tight hug, then<br>
    nods to Garen to take over.</p>
  <p>39 INT. ALDEA - CUSTODIAN ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Alexandra is still ON THE SCREEN.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Custodian, show me Jason...</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    Stop, Custodian.</p>
  <p> The screen GOES BLANK as the Custodian obeys Duana.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    We must work now... there is much<br>
    to learn.</p>
  <p> Wesley points to the locked door.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What's in there?</p>
  <p> Duana's eyes dart towards the fortress-like wall.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's probably the power source.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    I don't know. It's forbidden.<br>
    The Custodian allows no one in<br>
    there. There's no one left who's<br>

  <p>41 INT. ALDEA - FIRST UNIT CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly MATERIALIZE. Rashella and Radue<br>
    are waiting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want to see the children before<br>
    we begin.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    No. We're here to negotiate for<br>
    compensation, not to pander to<br>
    emotions. This way.</p>
  <p> They follow Radue to the same area where they had their<br>
    celebration. Radue motions them to be seated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Radue, we do not condone your<br>
    actions. You're attempting to<br>
    salve your conscience by offering<br>
    goods in exchange for our<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Why do you want them back so<br>
    badly? You can always make more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We happen to like these particular<br>
    children.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Humans have great attachment to<br>
    their offspring. But we're<br>
    digressing. Returning the<br>
    children is non-negotiable.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    I promise you they will have a<br>
    beautiful life with us. And<br>
    they'll be father and mother to<br>
    a new breed born of an ancient<br>
    culture.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What makes you think they'll be<br>
    able to have children? You can't.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    But they will. Our inability to<br>
    bear children is a genetic<br>
    dysfunction. It's not contagious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Radue, we do sympathize. But<br>
    surely there is a solution which<br>
    can be mutually satisfactory.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    For us, the problem is solved.<br>
    We are offering you information<br>
    on areas of the galaxy you don't<br>
    even know exist. What more can<br>
    we offer? What more would you<br>
    want?</p>

  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard pretends to be impressed. He waits a moment<br>
    before replying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A significant beginning, I think.<br>
    But first I must ask again that<br>
    Doctor Crusher be allowed to speak<br>
    with her son before we continue.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    You are a very stubborn people.<br>
    Ah, well, that can be a positive<br>
    trait. You may see him.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not yet, Wes.</p>
  <p> Wesley tries to accept this like a man.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh. I thought... never mind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you okay? And the others?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Okay, really okay. Everyone's<br>
    been assigned their own units...<br>
    you know, like families. We're<br>
    being treated, well, almost like<br>
    gods.</p>

    (lightly)<br>
    I won't.</p>
  <p> Beverly covers her surreptitious tricorder reading of<br>
    Wesley -- and of Duana -- with small talk.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So, what have you been doing?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm learning a lot. They have a<br>
    computer which they call the<br>
    Custodian. It controls<br>
    everything.<br>
    (lowers his voice)<br>
    The captain should know this.<br>
    All their defense systems, the<br>
    city's environment, everything.<br>
    And it's all voice command. So<br>
    simple. But the amazing thing<br>
    is the Aldeans don't know how it<br>
    works. They know how to talk to<br>
    it, but they don't even know what<br>
    its power source is, and they<br>
    didn't do the original<br>
    programming.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks down at the floor.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing; normal<br>
    voice)<br>
    They said that later on, when I'm<br>
    really an Aldean, I'll know all<br>
    their secrets.</p>
  <p> Beverly WHISPERS to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That won't happen, Wes. I promise<br>
    I won't let that happen.</p>
  <p> Duana becomes nervous about all the whispering.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    You must leave, Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> Duana escorts Beverly to the door. Beverly looks back<br>

  <p> Rashella is insulted by their doubt.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    Of course they're well.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>

    We are twenty hours away from<br>
    Aldea, and no closer to a<br>
    solution. Their deliberate show<br>
    of force pushed us out of orbit<br>

    Melian uses his pain-ridden hands to show Katie how<br>
    to use it. The instrument is small and circular, about<br>
    a foot in diameter. There's a pad for the thumb, and<br>
    for the fingers. It CHANGES COLORS for each different<br>

  <p> KATIE<br>
    It did exactly what I thought...<br>
    I mean, felt.</p>
  <p> MELIAN<br>
    Yes. It's a direct expression<br>
    of the music within. Now we just<br>
    have to teach you to structure<br>
    that feeling...</p>
  <p> Katie takes the instrument back from Melian and looks<br>

    Yes. It also explains their lack<br>

    I thought growing boys are always<br>
    hungry.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You didn't eat anything.</p>

    We need very little.</p>
  <p> DUANA<br>
    I know you miss your family. But<br>
    you will grow accustomed to us.<br>
    I promise. I promise you'll be<br>
    happy.</p>
  <p> Wesley's clear eyes look at Duana with compassion.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You can keep me here, but you<br>
    can't make me want to stay.<br>
    You'll never be able to make me<br>

    a carved dolphin.</p>
  <p> ACCOLAN<br>

    Beautiful!</p>
  <p> Harry gives Accolan the finished piece. Accolan<br>

  <p> HARRY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    It really turned out well.</p>
  <p> ACCOLAN<br>
    It is so graceful and alive. What<br>
    do you call it?</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    It's a dolphin.</p>
  <p> LEDA<br>
    Dolphin?</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    You know, it swims in the ocean.<br>
    Like a fish, only it's not a fish.</p>
  <p> LEDA<br>
    Ah. A fish. We used to have them<br>
    in our oceans. I've never seen<br>
    one before.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    I used to live near the ocean.<br>

    No. That doesn't fit the pattern.<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Show me where all the Enterprise<br>

  <p> The Custodian FLASHES the children's locations on the<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Thank you.</p>
  <p> He moves away from the console, then has second<br>
    thoughts.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Custodian, what's your instruction<br>
    set?</p>
  <p> Wesley is nervous, not sure he's authorized. The<br>
    Custodian ANSWERS WITH a kind of nonelectronic MUSIC.<br>
    Wesley doesn't understand, but goes on.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How can I command your attention?<br>
    Do you have a non-maskable<br>

    question.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> KATIE<br>
    Why will not talking or eating<br>
    make them send us home?</p>
  <p> Wesley patiently tries to explain again.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's called &quot;passive resistance.&quot;<br>
    We don't do anything they want<br>
    us to do and then they won't want<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> KATIE<br>
    Will they get mad at us?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    They won't hurt us.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    But, Wes, I do kind of like them.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    So do I, but I don't want to stay<br>
    here forever. Do you?</p>
  <p> Harry hesitates.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    (thoughtfully)<br>
    No, but I like working with the<br>
    wood.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Harry, we all have to do this<br>

  <p> With some reluctance, Harry agrees.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>

    It's not a hole as much as it is<br>
    a fluctuation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Still, there is a chance.<br>
    Captain, if we can time it exactly<br>
    -- I think we can beam a team<br>
    through the hole and onto the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why can't we beam the<br>
    children up through the hole?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The timing would be more<br>
    difficult, and the risk greater.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you suggesting, Number<br>
    One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beam through the hole. Locate<br>
    the source of the shield, and<br>
    knock it out.</p>

  <p> LEDA<br>
    Will you at least eat?</p>
  <p> They do not answer. She sets the tray down and LEAVES<br>
    the room. Alexandra wanders over to the food and looks<br>
    at it. Wesley knows that she's hungry. He goes to<br>
    Alexandra and kneels down.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know you're hungry. We all are,<br>
    but Alexandra, we are not going<br>
    to eat anything. It's our way<br>
    of telling them that we want to<br>
    go home. Do you understand?</p>

    they are on some sort of &quot;strike.&quot;<br>
    I don't understand it. You must<br>
    deal with this, Captain. I'm<br>
    not very good with children.</p>

    of energy, sir. Even more since<br>
    we have taken down the shield.</p>
  <p> RASHELLA<br>
    What are we going to do with it?</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Learn all over again... all this<br>
    time we've been destroying<br>
    ourselves. So secure, so sure<br>
    of our technological<br>
    invulnerability. Now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will you let us help?</p>
  <p> Radue puts his hand out to Picard.</p>
  <p> RADUE<br>
    Yes. Please.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>78 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND ALDEA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise uses a wide angle ENERGY BEAM to &quot;sew up<br>
    the hole&quot; in the atmosphere. (To be researched and<br>
    revised.)</p>
  <p>79 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Harry and his father walk hand in hand to Harry's<br>
    classroom. Harry stops in front of the door.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    Dad, I want to be an artist. And<br>
    I don't want to take calculus<br>
    anymore.</p>
  <p> DR. BERNARD<br>
    You can be anything you want,<br>
    Harry. Anything. But you still<br>
    have to take calculus.</p>
  <p> Harry thinks about it for a moment.</p>
  <p> HARRY<br>
    Okay. Thanks, Dad.</p>
  <p> They hug and Harry goes back to school.</p>
  <p>80 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer SHOWS the ship finishing its job on the<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It worked well, sir.</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS from a turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you finished?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. They're responding very well<br>
    to the treatment, but for this<br>
    to work, they can never use their<br>
    shield or be cloaked again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The legend will die, but the<br>
    people will live.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;When the Bough... &quot; - 12/11/87 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And we know they'll make good<br>
    parents.</p>
  <p> Alexandra WADDLES OFF the turbolift with Wesley. She's<br>
    carrying a flower.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wesley!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sorry, sir. She just wanted to<br>
    give you a present for bringing<br>
    her back to her mommy.</p>
  <p> Picard bends down to accept the flower -- and a hug.<br>
    Alexandra waves bye-bye to him and GOES BACK with<br>
    Wesley. The entire bridge crew tries not to snicker.<br>
    Picard gives them a fierce look to cover his<br>
    discomfort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, out of orbit.<br>
    Warp five.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (coughing)<br>
    Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns around and the rest of the crew can see<br>
    the stick-em toy on the back of his uniform.</p>
  <p>80A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at sub-warp speed, it heads for its next adventure.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
