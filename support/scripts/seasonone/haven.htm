  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;HAVEN&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - STARSHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise sweeps toward a beautiful blue-green<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 41294.5.<br>
    Our destination, the Class M Beta<br>
    Cassius planet known simply as<br>
    Haven. It is a world...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> PICARD sits alone in the Command Area. GEORDI is at the<br>
    Conn, WORF mans Ops, DATA's at Science Station #1.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... so renowned for its peaceful<br>
    beauty that some believe it to<br>
    have mystical healing powers.</p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He's lost in thought as he looks up at the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Such a beautiful world. Legends<br>
    say it has been known to mend<br>
    souls and heal broken hearts.</p>
  <p>5 TWO SHOT - DATA AND PICARD</p>
  <p> As Data looks up, considers Picard's statement.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Legends which are totally<br>
    unsupported by fact, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Legends like that are the spice<br>
    of the universe, Mister Data,<br>
    because they have a way of<br>
    sometimes coming true.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They have intrinsic value<br>
    regardless of the facts, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Facts are not everything, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (startled by the<br>
    thought)<br>
    Indeed, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Data seems to be trying to add this<br>
    blasphemous concept to his voluminous memory.<br>
    Meanwhile, Picard addresses the Conn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Standard orbit, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Standard orbit, sir.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise eases into orbit.</p>
  <p>7 INT. RIKER'S CABIN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN working delicate harp<br>
    instruments. These players radiate a warm sensuality.<br>
    Their &quot;harps&quot; sound more like mandolins and pedal steel<br>
    guitars.</p>
  <p>8<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    9</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> leaning back, fully enjoying this, until:</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Yar to Commander Riker.<br>
    Your presence is requested in<br>
    Transporter Room One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker sighs good-naturedly and gets to his feet. The<br>
    SONG IS SOARING in the b.g.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry ladies. Duty calls.</p>
  <p>11 ON RIKER AND THE WOMEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> For the first time, WE SEE that the Musicians are only<br>
    two feet tall. As he EXITS, Riker hits a switch and<br>
    the Songstresses DISAPPEAR.</p>
  <p>12 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM ONE</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, joining TASHA, GEORDI, and a TRANSPORTER<br>
    CHIEF.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant, you needed me?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Yes sir. There's an object of some<br>
    kind beaming in from Haven.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We're not sure. I'm holding it<br>
    in stasis until we can register<br>
    its exact nature. It's listed<br>
    as a gift for Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    For Deanna? From here?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That's what I wondered about.<br>
    She's on her way now.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    (indicating his viewer)<br>
    Surface Station approval coming<br>
    in now, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Okay, let's bring it in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The object is beamed aboard. WE SEE the surprised faces<br>
    of those in the room as a big black chest rests on the<br>
    transporter pad. Its design is somewhat old-fashioned<br>
    except for A ROUND SLEEPING HUMAN FACE ON ITS SIDE.<br>
    The chest is seamless and featureless except for the<br>
    slumbering Face. They circle it, looking for a way of<br>
    opening it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Odd looking. Why would one of<br>
    our people be getting a gift from<br>
    this world?</p>
  <p> Anxious to solve this mystery, Tasha moves in for a<br>
    closer look at the Face.</p>
  <p>14 FULL SHOT - INCLUDING FACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS the room, surprised to see them huddled at a<br>
    chest.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> Tasha gasps as the Face's eyes pop open. The Face<br>
    has come alive! Two bright red eyes scan the scene,<br>
    stopping only when they fall on Troi. All eyes turn<br>
    to Troi, who's as surprised as anyone.</p>
  <p> FACE<br>
    (deep, booming voice)<br>
    I hold a message for Deanna Troi!</p>
  <p> The Face grins wildly -- it seems overjoyed with the<br>
    news it is about to reveal.</p>
  <p> FACE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lwaxana Troi and the honorable<br>
    Miller Family will soon arrive!<br>
    The momentous day is close at<br>
    hand! Rejoice!</p>
  <p> The Face then abruptly SIGHS and goes back to sleep.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, oh NO... !</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Everyone turns to look at Troi, who is stunned and mute.<br>
    There is an another silence... but nothing happens until<br>
    Troi moves slowly to the chest and kneels close to<br>
    examine the Face. THE CHEST SUDDENLY GOES BANG. A door<br>
    flies open and dozens of brightly-colored gems and<br>
    trinkets spill out. The astonished onlookers get a<br>
    closer look at the items. Troi picks up a necklace<br>
    made of red Betazoid jewels (like the ones she wears in<br>
    her hair).</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't believe this!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Counselor, what's this all about?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (softly; slowly)<br>
    They're bonding gifts...<br>
    (pause)<br>
    ... what you would call...<br>
    wedding presents.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wedding presents? What wedding?<br>
    Who's getting married?</p>
  <p> Troi slowly turns to look him in the eye.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (in shock)<br>
    I am.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at her, immobilized.<br>
    FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>15 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise orbits Haven.</p>
  <p>16 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are with Troi. Riker is naturally<br>
    perturbed; this is a woman he's loved although without<br>
    any commitment being made. Picard is sorry to lose this<br>
    top quality counselor and he's curious over how it<br>
    happened -- and also curious about the effect of this<br>
    upon these key officers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was certain it would never<br>
    happen, Captain. The years I'd<br>
    spend on this mission, the<br>
    distance it has taken me away<br>
    from home...<br>
    (a deep breath)<br>
    As you must have heard, genetic<br>
    bonding is a Betazoid tradition.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But your father was human, Deanna.<br>
    The Millers are human...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You'd understand if you knew the<br>
    loveliness of my world. The<br>
    Millers and my father knew it,<br>
    they loved Betazed so that<br>
    they adopted the customs and<br>
    traditions, including this one.</p>
  <p> A hesitation, then Picard breaks in:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will you and your husband be<br>
    staying with the ship, Counselor?</p>
  <p> Her eyes go first to Riker in a way indicating her<br>
    answer has much to do with him. Then she answers the<br>
    captain:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard sees this, decides it is time to leave them<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then... I'll just say<br>
    congratulations for now, Deanna.<br>
    (including Riker)<br>
    If you'll excuse me.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi nod and MUMBLE a kind of assent, their<br>
    eyes very much on each other now. Picard EXITS. CAMERA<br>
    MOVES IN ON THE TWOSOME who stand uncomfortably eyeing<br>
    each other. Then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Bill ... more than anything else<br>
    in the world ... anything ... you<br>
    want to be a starship captain.<br>
    True?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I love you, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can feel that.<br>
    (nods; small smile)<br>
    I know you love me... within those<br>
    limits.<br>
    (touches him)<br>
    So almost more than anything else<br>
    in the world, I want to honor my<br>
    father's memory with this bonding.</p>
  <p> They look at each other. She has invited him to say<br>
    more and he considers it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Did you hear carefully what I<br>
    said?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods sadly)<br>
    Every word.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> They exchange a long, long look. Then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Come dance at my wedding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Interrupted by the SOUND OF A CHIME. Riker ignores it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll try.</p>
  <p> Then Worf ENTERS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Message from planet Haven,<br>
    Counselor. They wish to beam the<br>
    Miller...<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    ... ah, wedding party aboard.</p>
  <p> She nods, EXITS. Then Riker EXITS too, leaving behind a<br>
    Klingon who puzzles over the strange ways of humans.</p>
  <p>17<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    18</p>
  <p>19 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi face the platform. The Transporter<br>
    Chief stands by the controls, the platform in b.g.<br>
    SOUND of TRANSPORTER EFFECT, then THREE FIGURES<br>
    MATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>20 CLOSE ON TROI AND PICARD</p>
  <p> Troi's face reflects the fact that she's about to see<br>
    her future husband for the first time in nearly three<br>
    decades. Clearly, Picard is aware of the stress she<br>
    feels and sympathizes.</p>
  <p>21 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> The Miller Family steps off the platform. STEVEN MILLER<br>
    is a balding bear of a man in his late fifties.<br>
    VICTORIA MILLER is small and slim, prim and proper.<br>
    Their son WYATT is a likeable, blond young man with an<br>
    easy smile and an open, honest face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm Jean-Luc Picard, captain of<br>
    the Enterprise. Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    Quite some starship you have<br>
    here, captain. Look forward to<br>
    this visit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Oh, yes, yes.<br>
    (looks to Troi)<br>
    You couldn't be...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... I'm Deanna.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (dabbing her eyes)<br>
    Deanna darling! You probably<br>
    don't even remember me.</p>
  <p> Steven brushes by his wife and gives Troi a hug. Then<br>
    he holds Troi off, looking at her but speaking to his<br>
    wife excitedly. To one side Wyatt stares at Troi.</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    Wyatt was absolutely right,<br>
    Victoria. She is a beauty.</p>
  <p> Wyatt steps forward. He looks at her, but his smile<br>
    lacks something. Troi senses that something as she<br>
    looks into his eyes.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I'm Wyatt.</p>
  <p> He reaches out to her. When their hands touch, Mrs.<br>
    Miller begins to cry.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Isn't this simply beautiful?<br>
    I knew romance was still alive<br>
    somewhere.</p>
  <p>22 ANGLE EMPHASIZING WYATT AND TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wyatt offers Troi a large rose: Navy blue petals atop<br>
    a twisting golden stem. Troi studies the flower in<br>
    wonder.</p>
  <p> The petals are softly TURNING from blue to white.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I'd like you to have this. It's<br>
    a Chameleon Rose. It changes<br>
    color with the mood of its owner.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's wonderful. Thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She looks up from the rose and it seems Wyatt is<br>
    studying her face. What's he looking for?</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Deanna, did you like the chest?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, yes. Especially the way It<br>
    rolled its eyes at me.</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    (to Victoria; exuberant)<br>
    You see, Victoria? I told you<br>
    she'd love it!</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (to Picard and Troi)<br>
    I was in favor of something more<br>
    dignified.<br>
    (looks at Steven<br>
    critically)<br>
    Steven picked the ugliest face<br>
    imaginable.</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    It was a fine face. Full of<br>
    character!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Excuse me, but... when is my<br>
    mother arriving?</p>
  <p> Mr. and Mrs. Miller go silent, giving each other knowing<br>
    looks. Victoria frowns at the very mention of Mrs.<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Your mother's still down on the<br>
    planet, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Wyatt takes the initiative -- prodding his parents<br>
    toward the exit.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Er -- is there a place for my<br>
    parents to rest, Captain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    We're not really tired, son, and<br>
    besides I'd like to see some of<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Steven, you know full well<br>
    Lwaxana Troi isn't about to beam<br>
    aboard until we've cleared out.<br>
    So...</p>
  <p> Slight pause. Picard fills in the breach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can visit your quarters now,<br>
    if you wish.</p>
  <p> Victoria nods her thanks and Picard leads the family to<br>

    See the Millers to their<br>
    accommodations, please.<br>

    I'll join you all later.</p>
  <p> As Picard turns and RE-ENTERS, the Transporter Chief<br>
    looks up from a reading.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    A Mrs. Troi ready to beam up, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard throws a look toward Deanna, gets a nod, then<br>
    nods in turn to the Transporter Chief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So be it.</p>
  <p> As the Transporter Chief sets the Transporter controls:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wyatt seems a fine young man.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Yes, he does... But I'm not what<br>
    he expected.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Neither do I... but I'm definitely<br>
    a surprise of some sort to him.</p>
  <p> THE SHIMMERING HUM OF THE TRANSPORTER EFFECT turns both<br>
    heads toward the platform.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I should warn you. My mother's<br>
    a bit... eccentric.</p>
  <p> There's expectation as A GAUNT FIGURE IN A FLOWING<br>
    BLACK ROBE materializes. He has faded white-grey skin<br>
    and beady purple eyes. He moves smoothly and<br>
    deliberately. Quite a ghostly figure this MR. HOMN.<br>
    ANOTHER FIGURE begins to materialize. As it<br>
    solidifies, CAMERA MOVES IN ON MRS. TROI, who looks<br>
    like a Bohemian Queen. Her gown is striking, as is her<br>
    jewelry. Her facial make-up, though unusual, brings out<br>
    her high-cheekboned beauty. Behind her, a large,<br>
    ornate luggage item has also BEAMED IN with her.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (looks around)<br>
    Where is everyone?</p>
  <p>22A EMPHASIZING TASHA AND MOTHER</p>
  <p> Troi moves toward her.</p>

    Hello, Mother...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    (turning to Troi)<br>
    Don't say it... think it. Use your<br>
    mind, not your mouth.</p>
  <p> Troi refuses to go along, uses words, repeating:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello Mother.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    Deanna. Shame! What has this<br>
    life done to you?</p>
  <p> Mr. Homn helps Mrs. Troi off the platform. Picard is<br>
    about to introduce himself when Mrs. Troi cuts him off.</p>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Don't tell me. You're the<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling; nods)<br>
    Of course. Your daughter<br>
    explained your telepathic<br>
    abilities.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    That wasn't telepathy, it was<br>
    common sense. Who else would they<br>
    send to greet me but the Captain?<br>
    (indicates luggage item)<br>
    You may carry my luggage.</p>
  <p> This stumps Picard for an instant, but then he nods,<br>
    STEPS ONTO the platform.</p>

    No, no, quite all right. I'm<br>
    indebted to your mother for<br>
    the... the fine counselor she...</p>
  <p> The luggage item is much heavier than Picard realized<br>
    and it takes so much effort to lift it that he<br>
    GRUNTS-GROANS slightly and realizes he is trapped into<br>
    displaying something less than a dignified figure.</p>

    Picard MOVE OUT into the Corridor. Picard is laboring<br>
    and Deanna looks toward him anxiously. A couple of<br>
    crewpersons pass and double-take this strange use of<br>
    their captain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, it's quite inappropriate<br>
    to ask the captain to...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Yes, you do seem to be having<br>
    difficulty. A man your age must<br>
    work to keep himself in shape.</p>
  <p> Troi stops short.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not going another step this<br>
    way!<br>

    A starship has its customs just<br>
    as we do. Please set that down,<br>

    If you're my mother's valet, then<br>
    please valet!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, so long as you insist...</p>
  <p> The Captain sets the luggage down gratefully.<br>
    Meanwhile, Mrs. Troi turns to him apologetically.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I apologize for her behavior.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Do you realize you've embarrassed<br>
    your captain?<br>
    (to Homn)<br>
    Do as she says. Anything to avoid<br>
    a quarrel on this occasion.</p>

  <p> The seemingly frail Mr. Homn bends, easily lifts the<br>
    heavy luggage. Picard's look of astonishment at this is<br>
    covered by Mrs. Troi taking his arm possessively and<br>
    leading him down the corridor.</p>
  <p>24A PANNING SHOT</p>
  <p> Deanna hurries to walk with Picard and her mother. She<br>
    indicates Homn following them with the luggage.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother -- what happened to Xelo?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I was forced to terminate his<br>
    employment.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Xelo was strongly attracted to<br>

    As for me, I've found it shocking<br>
    how they've changed in the years<br>
    since my husband and I knew them.<br>
    Or perhaps, I've just grown beyond<br>
    them. You realize of course that<br>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Yes, the room is adequate.<br>
    Small, but adequate. You will<br>
    of course adjust the temperature<br>
    to a civilized level.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll see what I can do. Now if<br>
    you'll excuse me, I'm sure you<br>
    two have a lot to talk about.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Yes Captain, you may go.</p>
  <p> Picard is only too happy to WALK OUT, past the strong<br>
    Mr. Homn who begins to unpack for Mrs. Troi.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    You've been slack, little one.<br>
    Allowed your mental powers to<br>
    rust.</p>
  <p> TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    To avoid becoming confused,<br>
    mother. Humans constantly think<br>
    one thing but say another.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    Yes, they do, don't they. The<br>
    poor dears. Our style of complete<br>
    honesty frightens them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (switching to voice)<br>
    On that subject Mother, there is<br>
    such a thing as too much honesty<br>
    with humans.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    Nonsense. It sets them a good<br>
    example. If they'd only say what<br>
    they think instead of hiding it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But they're accustomed to hiding<br>
    their thoughts...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V.O.<br>
    And I quite understand what you<br>
    faced here. An entire shipload<br>
    of such inconsistency could drive<br>
    one insane.</p>

  <p> Mrs. Troi, rearranging what Homn unpacks, looks at her<br>

    She now uses her VOICE.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Darling, I'm sorry this had to<br>
    happen. Truly I am. But Steven<br>

    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> VALEDA<br>
    An incoming vessel has bypassed<br>
    our stargate, violating our law.<br>
    It has refused all attempts at<br>
    communication.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying you believe it to<br>
    be hostile?</p>
  <p> VALEDA<br>
    Failure to communicate is<br>
    inherently hostile.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    We have no defensive capabilities<br>
    here and our treaty specifies<br>
    your obligations in that regard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> WYATT<br>
    Your mother's honest -- I respect<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, but she never lets up.</p>

    you'd know. Can't you do that<br>
    at all?</p>
  <p> Troi concentrates on Wyatt, for a moment, then</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes... This could be what mother<br>
    felt about you. I believe we could<br>
    read each other eventually.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>

    on this ship.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Oh? Do I have competition?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. All he wants is to captain<br>
    a starship.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    What I want is to... well, to do<br>
    another kind of brave and noble<br>
    thing... which you may find<br>
    prosaic. What I want is to cure<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, since I am a practicing<br>
    psychologist, maybe we can work<br>
    in concert. We are going to be<br>
    together a long time.</p>
  <p> His smile fades. He looks Troi in the eyes.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Yes. That's the point of<br>

    over several years and show development from girl to<br>
    woman. There is a compelling intensity to the work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    disappointment. You're so<br>
    beautiful, I-- I feel honored.</p>
  <p> It is clear they've begun to like each other... but also<br>
    that they both feel more or less trapped by the<br>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>37 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Enterprise in orbit around Haven.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. It<br>
    has been believed the Tarellian<br>
    race was extinct, an assumption<br>
    contradicted now by the sight of<br>
    one of their vessels...</p>
  <p>38 INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Beverly, Geordi, Tasha and Troi are<br>
    seated around the table with Data at the front viewer.<br>
    INTERCUT this with viewer as necessary.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... approaching Haven.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The fact it is traveling at its<br>
    present velocity suggests an<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A damaged vessel, sir? That could<br>
    explain it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    If it were unable to reach warp<br>
    speed, it would have taken all<br>
    these years to get here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Continue with the briefing, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data touches a control and a six planet solar system<br>
    chart appears on the viewer, the second of the six<br>
    planets enlarges to show two island land masses. Then,<br>
    as Data continues, that IMAGE will become alive with<br>
    FLASHING TECHNICAL INFORMATION such as gravity,<br>
    atmosphere, planet dimensions, mineral composition,<br>
    temperature details, etc.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Class M world, much like your<br>
    Earth world, very similar humanoid<br>
    life form, which faced the<br>
    unfortunate old story of their<br>
    hatreds outrunning their<br>
    intelligence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hostilites between the two land<br>
    masses?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Ending with one of them... it<br>
    doesn't really matter<br>
    which... unleashing a deadly<br>
    biological weapon on the other.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (glumly)<br>
    And naturally the other also<br>
    became infected in the end...<br>
    (shaking head)<br>
    It makes one question the<br>
    intelligence of humanoid forms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you acquainted with the facts<br>
    of the infection, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They had reached Earth's<br>
    late-twentieth century, early<br>
    twenty-first century level. Which<br>
    was all that's needed if you're<br>
    a damned fool. A highly deadly,<br>
    extra-infectious virus... which<br>
    at that modest level of knowledge,<br>
    is not that difficult to grow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We learned the rest of the story<br>
    in security training. Some<br>
    Tarellians made it to other worlds<br>
    only to die along with the<br>
    populations they infected.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It's pretty well covered in<br>
    Academy training now, Captain.<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Many of them tried to avoid other<br>
    inhabited worlds as they<br>
    escaped... only to be hunted down<br>
    and destroyed anyway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, we had believed<br>
    the last Tarellian vessel was<br>
    destroyed eight years ago by the<br>
    Alcyones.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Exactly when will they reach<br>
    Haven?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly thirteen hours, nine<br>
    minutes, twenty-one...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting; to all)<br>
    Which will create a very difficult<br>
    problem for the Enterprise at that<br>
    time. Our treaty here requires<br>
    us to protect Haven from alien<br>
    threats ... and a plague ship<br>
    certainly qualifies as that. But<br>
    Federation policy requires us to<br>
    assist life forms in need ... which<br>
    qualifies the Tarellians too.<br>
    I'll want you to help me find some<br>
    answers by then.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses, the assembled bridge crew sitting<br>
    concerned. Then:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All of which gives ample time for<br>
    your second assignment. Or you<br>
    may prefer it on a volunteer<br>
    basis.<br>
    (beat; then smiles to<br>
    Troi)<br>
    The pre-joining dinner of<br>
    Counselor Deanna Troi will proceed<br>
    as planned.</p>
  <p>39 OMITTED</p>
  <p>40 INT. FORMAL DINING AREA</p>
  <p> The dinner party is in progress, attended by the Bridge<br>
    Officers, the Millers, Mrs. Troi and Mr. Homn, all of<br>
    whom are standing, chatting, having a drink as the<br>
    dinner table is made finally ready. The officers wear<br>
    ceremonial dress. Mrs. Troi wears a length of vine<br>
    which seems at this time to be merely decorative. Mr.<br>
    Homn stands erect by himself at a small table to one<br>
    side. There are a dozen or so tall, fluted glasses on<br>
    the table, along with a small bell suspended from a<br>
    unique, arched crescent. Homn watches the goings-on<br>
    like a silent sentinel.</p>
  <p>41 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> approached by Mr. and Mrs. Miller.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    We've talked it over, Captain.<br>
    We'd like you to perform the<br>
    ceremony.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd be honored, Mrs. Miller.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi has overheard.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Impossible. The captain is not<br>
    practiced in the ways of Betazed<br>
    joining.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    This will be a traditional Earth<br>
    ceremony!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I'm sorry, but it proceeds out<br>
    of a Betazed bonding.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    And I am sorry, Lwaxana, but my<br>
    family and I are living on Earth<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    So that's why you want that<br>
    barbaric ritual.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Terrible, Captain, to see a woman<br>
    go downhill like this...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Downhill?!</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    The human ritual is out of the<br>
    question!</p>
  <p>42 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> Enthralled by the latest flare-up.</p>
  <p>43 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Who are you to tell us what's<br>
    out of the question?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (cool, superior)<br>
    Your ignorance is astonishing.<br>
    I am Lwaxana Troi: Daughter of<br>
    The Fifth House, Holder of the<br>
    Sacred Chalice of Rixx, Heir to<br>
    the Holy Rings of Betazed.<br>
    (pause; insultingly)<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> Victoria, infuriated, turns to Steven for support.<br>
    Before Steven can approach him, Picard steps in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me, everyone, but dinner<br>
    is served...<br>
    (to the mothers;<br>
    smiling)<br>
    ... and by Starfleet tradition,<br>
    all disputes and disagreements<br>
    are thereby resolved.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (moving off)<br>
    In who's favor?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The captain's.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    That's not what you're thinking.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captains are not required to<br>
    think.</p>
  <p> Picard puts his arm out for Mrs. Troi, who lets him<br>
    escort her to her chair, where Wyatt waits to pull it<br>
    out for her. Riker watches Troi, trying to be pleasant<br>
    while helping seat Mrs. Miller.</p>
  <p>44 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Everyone is seated around the table. Stewards are busy<br>
    serving food.</p>
  <p>45 EMPASIZING VICTORIA</p>
  <p> still seething.</p>
  <p>46 EMPHASIZING MRS. TROI</p>
  <p> Adjusting her decorative vine, throwing a look toward<br>
    Victoria</p>
  <p>47 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (raising glass)<br>
    A toast. To the young couple and<br>
    their families. May this union<br>
    be a happy and productive one.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Everyone drinks to this.</p>
  <p>48 OMITTED</p>
  <p>48A CLOSE ON MRS. TROI</p>
  <p> Adjusting her decorative vine, but she seems to be<br>
    doing it in an &quot;affectionate&quot; way. Now, unnoticed by<br>
    others, she has picked up a crumb of food from the<br>
    table, CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER as she offers it to the<br>
    end of the vine which seems to be &quot;nibbling&quot; at it.</p>
  <p>49 ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND MR. HOMN</p>
  <p> She looks on in wonder as Homn, now seated, downs an<br>
    astonishing quantity of liquid, drinking one glass after<br>
    another, without stopping, each with a different color.</p>
  <p>50 ANGLE ON WYATT AND PICARD</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Is it true, Captain -- that<br>
    there's a Tarellian ship, headed<br>
    for Haven?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, it's true.</p>
  <p> Wyatt is puzzled about this.</p>
  <p>51 ANGLE ON HOMN</p>
  <p> still putting away a steady stream of fluids.</p>
  <p>52 ANGLE TO INCLUDE WYATT AND OTHERS</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    That's amazing! I've read<br>
    everything I could about them.<br>
    Biological virus analysis was a<br>
    favorite subject at medical<br>
    school.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In which case, I'd very much like<br>
    to meet with you, sir. I'm<br>
    pleased to have a medical<br>
    colleague aboard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A BELL RINGS OUT. It's a small bell, but it gives off<br>
    a shrill RING. Mr. Homn hits it after every bite Mrs.<br>
    Troi takes.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    (distracted by the bell)<br>
    Yes, ma'am... Uh, Doctor? Would<br>
    it be possible to prepare some<br>
    medical supplies, geared toward<br>
    the Tarellian's probable needs?<br>
    We could beam it over without any<br>
    fear of infection.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    What do you think, Doctor?</p>
  <p> The bell RINGS again... It's becoming highly<br>
    distractive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think it's a considerate idea.<br>
    (to Wyatt)<br>
    Sickbay's at your disposal,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Homn RINGS the bell again as Mrs. Troi takes another<br>
    bite.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (to Homn)<br>
    Must you do that?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (never looking up from<br>
    food)<br>
    As you well know, it is the<br>
    Betazed way of giving thanks for<br>
    the food we eat.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (amused)<br>
    You? Giving thanks? Besides, you<br>
    never did this before.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I do it now. Unlike some people,<br>
    I am in growth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> As if to prove her point, she takes a big bite -- Homn<br>
    RINGS the bell accordingly.</p>
  <p>52A CLOSER ON MRS. TROI</p>
  <p> As she &quot;adjusts&quot; her vine, loosening it and CAMERA MOVES<br>
    IN TO REVEAL the &quot;vine&quot; now beginning to move toward<br>
    where Victoria sits next to Mrs. Troi. CAMERA PANS IT<br>
    inching along somewhat like a caterpillar until<br>
    Victoria's ARM COMES INTO VIEW.</p>
  <p>52B TWO SHOT OF MRS. TROI AND VICTORIA</p>
  <p> as Mrs. Troi turns to Victoria, watching the &quot;vine&quot; move<br>
    toward Victoria's arm.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Victoria, I've forgotten whether<br>
    you enjoy pets or not.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi has taken another bite, the bell RINGS again,<br>
    and Victoria gives Mrs. Troi only a quick annoyed<br>
    glance.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Love them, of course.</p>
  <p>52C INSERT SHOT</p>
  <p> The &quot;vine&quot; reaching Victoria's arm, beginning to wrap<br>
    itself around her wrist.</p>
  <p>52D BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> Victoria becomes slowly aware of something tightening<br>
    on her wrist, looks down, SCREAMS. Mrs. Troi, begins<br>
    taking her &quot;vine&quot; back.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Gently... gently!<br>
    (retrieves vine)<br>
    I thought you said you enjoyed<br>
    pets.</p>
  <p>53 EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> Watches Mrs. Troi gather in her &quot;vine,&quot; then goes back<br>
    to eating listlessly. It's clear he's unhappy. He<br>
    looks up to see Troi gazing at him from across the<br>
    table. They lock eyes. They each have so much to say,<br>
    and so little time. And this is not the place. He<br>
    decides to stand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>54 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker turning to the Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... If I may be excused...<br>
    (lamely)<br>
    ... to spend some time considering<br>
    the Tarellian situation...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (rises; slight bow)<br>
    Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
  <p> He EXITS. Mrs. Troi turns to Victoria.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Why didn't he mention you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mrs. Troi, I'm very interested<br>
    in the Betazed ceremony you<br>
    mentioned. Could you tell us<br>
    more?</p>
  <p>55 CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> She cringes.</p>
  <p>56 BACK TO FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I'd be delighted, Commander. It<br>
    is an ancient ceremony, widely<br>
    regarded as the most beautiful<br>
    in the universe.</p>
  <p> She takes a tiny bite. Homn hits the bell VERY LIGHTLY.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    After the young couple remove<br>
    their clothing --</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    The Bride and Groom go naked?!</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    No. You misunderstand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Wyatt looks vastly relieved.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All guests must go unclothed.<br>
    This honors the act of love being<br>
    celebrated...</p>
  <p>57 ANGLE ON VICTORIA</p>
  <p> nearly choking on her food.</p>
  <p>58 ANGLE ON STEVEN</p>
  <p> He smiles slightly -- thinking about it.</p>
  <p>59 FULL SHOT</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing; to<br>
    Victoria)<br>
    Don't worry too much, dear. Your<br>
    body's not that bad.</p>
  <p> Picard is bemused; Victoria is beside herself, so angry<br>
    and embarrassed that she can't even spit out the words.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Besides, your husband quite likes<br>
    the idea of seeing me unclothed.</p>
  <p> Victoria jerks her head toward Steven who quickly puts<br>
    his drink down and tries to look innocent, as:</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Steven!!</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You did know he's attracted to<br>
    me, didn't you?</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    Untrue! I don't.... Not really...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (rising; angrily)<br>
    Stop it, all of you --<br>
    (to her mother)<br>
    Especially you!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (turning to Picard)<br>
    Captain, as you requested, I have<br>
    carefully avoided disagreements<br>
    during this. But did you wish<br>
    me to ignore what my senses tell<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> Then Mrs. Troi shrugs and takes a bite of food. Homn<br>
    strikes the BELL -- and Troi comes to her feet, knocks<br>
    it off the table with the back of her hand and marches<br>
    toward the door and is OUT before anyone can say<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p>60 CLOSE ON HOMN</p>
  <p> Laughing to himself, he then happily kills another<br>
    glassful.</p>
  <p>61 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> A dark cloud hangs over the gathering. After a few<br>
    moments of petrified silence, Data breaks the ice.</p>

    Could you please continue your<br>
    bickering? I find it intriguing.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>63 INT. HOLODECK -- DESERT LANDSCAPE (DUSK) (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> His back to us, Riker stands in the desert, silhouetted<br>
    against the horizon. This is a lonely, lifeless place<br>
    -- beautiful but barren. A place picked to match a<br>
    mood. Troi ENTERS SHOT, coming in through the archway<br>
    as we PULL BACK to SEE the desert again. If Riker hears<br>
    her coming, he doesn't turn around.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why did you order up a desert?</p>
  <p> Riker gives her a look, then stares off into the<br>
    distance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It matches my mood. Empty.</p>
  <p>63A CLOSER SHOT</p>
  <p> Troi concentrating on him, then nods.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. It does.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I lost you once before, and now<br>
    I've lost you again.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you certain exactly who lost<br>
    who, Imzadi?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't use that word now, Deanna...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It means 'my beloved.'</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It also suggests the same feeling<br>
    will go on ... tomorrow, and<br>
    tomorrow...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It suggests a kind of bonding ... an<br>
    agreement...</p>
  <p> Riker sits silently. After a long moment of waiting:</p>

    As I said ... I understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you? Really?<br>
    (turns; moves close)<br>
    Imzadi... yes, you are my beloved.<br>
    Today. But I can't lie to you<br>
    and say I'm certain about tomorrow<br>
    ... and tomorrow ... I can't<br>
    guarantee it will be something<br>
    you can share.<br>
    (moves close to a kiss)<br>
    Because you are my Imzadi, I<br>
    refuse to promise you a future<br>
    I can't yet see.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How... would an Earth woman react<br>
    to that, Bill?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To an Earth woman, I'd lie.<br>

  <p> Wyatt moves in and Riker CROSSES OUT OF SHOT toward the<br>
    Holodeck entrance.</p>
  <p>64 ON WYATT</p>
  <p> Head cocked, spinning around joyously -- taking in the<br>
    wonders of the Holodeck. By the time he turns in a full<br>

    (continuing)<br>
    I respected what you did<br>
    tonight...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I lost my temper.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    It worked. You shamed them into<br>
    compromise. After you left it<br>
    really calmed down.<br>
    (he laughs)<br>
    The Joining will be half-Betazed,<br>
    half-Old Earth. The Captain'll<br>
    do the ceremony and Mister Homn<br>
    will be my best man.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And we'll take our clothes half<br>
    off?</p>
  <p> Wyatt laughs at this. It's clear he very much likes<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Some of us all. You do... I<br>
    do... Your mother, my father.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    But not my mother.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How did you manage that?</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I didn't. Your mother did.</p>
  <p> They laugh together. She's beginning to really like<br>
    Wyatt too.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I just caught my father,<br>
    practicing naked in front of his<br>
    mirror.</p>
  <p> He imitates his father preening, holding in his belly<br>
    and looking at himself from every side. They LAUGH.<br>
    Troi sits on a small hillock, closes her eyes, stretches<br>
    and lies back. Wyatt sits beside her, looking at her<br>
    fondly.</p>

    And so... A question I should have<br>
    asked before.<br>
    (takes her shoulders;<br>
    turns her to him)<br>
    Deanna... do you really want to<br>
    go through with this?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes. I want to.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I'm a very lucky man.</p>
  <p> He kisses her. Tentatively at first, gently. Then she<br>
    begins to kiss back; he reacts to this and Deanna too.</p>

  <p> WRENN<br>
    My name is Wrenn... and before<br>
    I inquire why you've trapped us<br>
    here, is there one aboard your<br>
    vessel named Wyatt?</p>

    No, no. We've learned to face<br>

    Haven is a remarkably lovely and<br>
    pleasant place, is it not? All<br>
    we want is a resting place until<br>
    the last of us are gone.</p>
  <p> Picard clearly feels the hurt of what he is going to<br>
    have to say. It is in his voice:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm... sorry, but circumstances<br>
    make it impossible for us to allow<br>
    you to beam down to Haven.</p>
  <p> WRENN<br>
    We do not ask to make contact with<br>
    those living below. All we ask<br>
    is to be on the edge of some sea,<br>
    some unpopulated island or faraway<br>
    peninsula...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not our planet, sir. I'll<br>
    be happy to present your needs<br>
    to those who govern this world...</p>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Isn't this combination exciting?<br>
    But I can't wear it, of course,<br>
    since your father would be<br>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Yes, that was puzzling. A woman<br>

    thoughts the way you do...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Fascinating, Wyatt, how easily<br>
    your thoughts come through. I<br>
    wonder if it is because you were<br>
    raised on Betazed?<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Well, no matter, I can see you<br>
    were wrong for my daughter anyway.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Ma'am?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    The answer to the puzzle of Ariana<br>
    and you is too simple for most<br>

    Of course. It's something they<br>
    all know instinctively but go<br>
    to great effort to reject or to<br>
    build complicated superstitions<br>
    about it. All life, Wyatt, all<br>
    consciousness, wherever or<br>
    whenever it occurs... is<br>
    indissolvably bound together.<br>
    Indeed, it is all part of the same<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    (startled; considers<br>
    it)<br>
    Yes! I have wondered if something<br>
    like that...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>

    astonishment, his heart pounding wildly. Suddenly he<br>
    senses something behind him, and spins to see FIVE<br>
    TARELLIANS standing in the doorway.</p>
  <p> WRENN<br>
    Hello, Wyatt. We always thought<br>
    you were a dream.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    You're not surprised. Did you<br>

  <p>90 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    How could you let this happen?<br>
    My son, surrounded by those<br>
    horrible lepers!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Miller, if I could have<br>
    prevented this...</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Then beam him back!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He can never come back, Mrs.<br>
    Miller.</p>
  <p> Victoria looks like she is about to faint. Then her<br>
    attention is drawn to the Bridge Viewer.</p>
  <p>91 ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Wyatt, Ariana, and Wrenn APPEAR on screen.</p>
  <p> WRENN<br>
    You may turn off your tractor<br>
    beam, Captain. We will not be<br>
    going to Haven.</p>
  <p> VICTORIA<br>
    Wyatt!</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    Mother...Father... Forgive me,<br>
    but I must... I'm going to try<br>
    to cure these people.</p>
  <p> ARIANA<br>
    And Wyatt will do it. I've<br>
    believed that all along.</p>
  <p> Wyatt puts his arm around Ariana and speaks with<br>
    difficulty.</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I knew I was coming to Haven to<br>
    meet my destiny. I thought it was<br>
    to be with you, Deanna. But it<br>
    was Ariana who drew me here. I'm<br>
    sorry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wyatt, I'm happy for you. Ariana,<br>
    I love you both.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (softly)<br>
    You've done surprisingly well for<br>
    a human, Wyatt.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother...</p>
  <p> WYATT<br>
    I take that as a compliment,<br>
    Deanna.</p>
  <p> Wyatt smiles; Troi smiles, proud of her mother.</p>
  <p>92 ANGLE ON THE MILLERS</p>
  <p> saddened, but becoming more confident of their son's<br>
    judgment.</p>
  <p>93 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> WRENN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    My respects, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And mine, sir.</p>
  <p> The Tarellian image begins to fade from the screen.<br>
    CAMERA MOVES IN on Troi, who stares at the screen long<br>
    after it's gone black.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (whispering)<br>
    Good-bye.</p>
  <p>94 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Tarellian ship pulls away from Haven -- heading for<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Haven&quot; - 7/13/87 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>95 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> STEVEN<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    Keep the chest. You'll have use<br>
    for it some day.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi ENTERS, followed by Homn carrying her<br>
    luggage.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Seems such a shame to waste that<br>
    lovely wedding dress. Perhaps I<br>
    should stay and be Joined to a<br>
    new mate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What??</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    The captain is highly attracted<br>
    to me, but he's a little too old.</p>
  <p> Picard lifts his eyebrows in surprise.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing; to Riker)<br>
    Perhaps I should choose you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    He has other obligations, Mother!</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    -- Very well. It's his loss.<br>
    Mister Homn!</p>
  <p> She kisses Troi and abruptly turns to step onto the<br>
    platform... Homn grabs her bag and turns to the<br>
    officers.</p>
  <p> HOMN<br>
    (deep voice)<br>
    Thank you for the drinks.</p>
  <p> The officers are caught off guard by his voice. Homn<br>
    joins Mrs. Troi on the transporter pad.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI TELEPATHIC V. O.<br>
    Try and remember your heritage,<br>
    little one.<br>
    (spoken)<br>
    You may energize.</p>

  <p>96 ON MRS. TROI AND HOMN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the transporter ACTIVATES, she stares at Picard, as<br>
    if something shocking has just entered her mind.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Captain! Even Xelo never had such<br>
    thoughts about me.</p>
  <p> Before Picard reacts, Mrs. Troi and Homn have been<br>
    BEAMED AWAY.</p>
  <p>96A EMPHASIZING PICARD AND TROI</p>
  <p> He is still at a loss, but Troi is smiling at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That was meant as a joke, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But she has claimed to be so<br>
    completely honest.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Except when a lie is more amusing.<br>
    Weren't you amused?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firmly)<br>
    I was not!</p>
  <p>97 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Our regulars all at their stations.</p>

    Aye, sir.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Warp two, helm, heading five-seven<br>
    mark three-one-nine.</p>
  <p> Riker lays a very happy look upon Troi and she returns<br>
    it, as:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Warp two, five-seven mark<br>
    three-one-nine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
