  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;11001001&quot; </p>
  <p> TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - STARBASE AND ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise moves toward Starbase 74.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 41365.9.<br>
    The Enterprise has been ordered<br>
    to Starbase 74, in orbit around<br>
    Tarsas III.</p>
  <p>2 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise closes with the huge starbase<br>
    entrance port.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... where a routine maintenance<br>
    check of all systems will be made,<br>
    and certain upgrades completed,<br>
    including the Holodeck, with which<br>
    we have had problems. I anticipate<br>
    a glowing report. This ship has<br>
    performed magnificently -- beyond<br>
    anyone's expectations.</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The REGULAR CREWMEMBERS are in their accustomed places<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Coming into position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Stand by to dock.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ready to dock.</p>
  <p>4 INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise moves into docking position.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Engage mooring beams and lock<br>
    off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p>5 INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two elements COME INTO PLACE.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Docking complete.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Number One. Well<br>
    done, and well done all.</p>
  <p>7 INT. ENTERPRISE AIR LOCK</p>
  <p> A hatch OPENS to the Starbase and allows the easy<br>
    passage of people and supplies. There is a RUSH OF<br>
    AIR as the hatch opens. Then a group of maintenance<br>
    personnel EMERGE from the far end and CROSS to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>8 INT. AIR-LOCK CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker greet the starbase personnel.<br>
    Commander ORFIL QUINTEROS, the base commander, steps<br>
    forward. TWO other pale, frail people with translucent<br>
    skin stand nearby. They are the BYNARS.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    Commander Quinteros; request<br>
    permission to come aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted -- and welcome.</p>
  <p> Quinteros STEPS FORWARD and shakes Picard's hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As the two shake hands the group moves down the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    You're late. We expected you a<br>
    week ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were unexpectedly delayed at<br>
    Omicron Pascal.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    Is there anything specific you<br>
    wish to report, or that we should<br>
    be aware of?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We are very pleased with the<br>
    operation of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    I knew you would be - I was in<br>
    charge of the team which put her<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And are these gentlemen the<br>
    Bynars?</p>
  <p> He indicates the Bynars.</p>
  <p>8A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> as they ENTER.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    They're not gentlemen or ladies,<br>
    Commander.<br>
    (off Riker's look)<br>
    They are a unified pair. Always<br>
    together. This is One Zero.</p>
  <p> One Zero bows.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And this is Zero One.</p>
  <p> Zero One bows. Picard and Riker nod to them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They just finished upgrading the<br>
    computers on the Wellington -- did<br>
    a great job.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the Bynars)<br>
    Your reputation precedes you.<br>
    I am pleased you will be improving<br>
    our system.</p>
  <p> BYNAR ONE ZERO<br>
    It is a great pleasure...</p>
  <p> BYNAR ZERO ONE<br>
    ... to work on such a large mobile<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have forty-eight hours,<br>
    because at forty-eight plus six<br>
    we have an appointment at Pelleus<br>
    Five which we must keep.</p>
  <p> The Bynars swap a look with each another.</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    I thought we'd...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... have more time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry. Our mission can't be<br>
    delayed. Can we postpone this<br>
    work?</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    Oh, no. This is...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... the best time...</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    ... to do it.</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    We can complete...</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    ... our work within the...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... time allotted.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    They work very quickly, but it'll<br>
    be tight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker and I will stay<br>
    aboard, and be available should<br>
    you need us.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    Thank you, Captain. I don't think<br>
    we'll need you until we're ready<br>
    for inspection.</p>
  <p> Quinteros nods and FOLLOWS the Bynars AWAY, who CHATTER.</p>
  <p>9 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker walking along.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Bynars are perfect for this.<br>
    This is the first time I've come<br>
    in contact with them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As I understand it, over time<br>
    they've become so interconnected<br>
    with the master computer on their<br>
    planet that their language and<br>
    thought patterns have become as<br>
    near to binary as possible for<br>
    organic beings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It will be interesting to see how<br>
    they improve a computer as<br>
    advanced as ours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I'm going to put my feet<br>
    up, turn on my personal relaxation<br>
    light and lose myself in the pages<br>
    of some old novels.</p>
  <p> They STEP INTO the turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>10 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Picard gives their destination.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bridge.<br>
    (then:)<br>
    And you, Number One? You've<br>
    earned a good rest. What are you<br>
    going to do with it?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles. The turbolift doors OPEN.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never been good at organizing<br>
    my time off, but something will<br>
    come up -- it always does.</p>
  <p> Picard nods at him, and STEPS OFF.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll be in my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges with a nod. Picard heads toward<br>
    his Ready Room as Riker STEPS ONTO the bridge.</p>
  <p>A11 INT. STARBASE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ESTABLISH the Enterprise inside the immense interior.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> CLOSE-UP on two of the Bynars as they pull open a<br>
    panel. PULL BACK TO REVEAL Riker and Wesley watching<br>
    them. Other than these four, the bridge is empty.<br>
    The Bynars' CONVERSATION IS UNINTELLIGIBLE. It's a<br>
    flow of data based information, which SOUNDS LIKE<br>
    HIGH-SPEED RADIO MULTIPLEX IN BURSTS. The sound of<br>
    it, and the movements of the aliens amuses Riker. TWO<br>
    BYNARS ENTER the bridge and COME hurriedly UP. They<br>
    are all in a state of agitation. The CONVERSATION goes<br>
    on AT VERY HIGH SPEED.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought there were only going<br>
    to be two of you.</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    Because of the limited time<br>
    allotted...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    ... us, we need others...</p>
  <p> The newly-arrived Bynars continue with a HIGH SPEED<br>
    STREAM OF AGITATED CONVERSATION.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (picking up on their<br>
    agitation)<br>
    Is there a problem?</p>
  <p> The Bynars closest turn toward Riker.</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    Ah... No...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ...no. No problem.</p>
  <p> The tone - the hesitation. Riker isn't satisfied.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then why are you all so excited?</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    Because we... ah... have to...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... the ah, stacking...</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    ... to reconfigure the computer...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... to communicate with itself...</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    ... more efficiently...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... and at higher speeds.</p>
  <p> Zero One and One Zero MOVE OFF to help their mates.<br>
    Riker watches, concerned.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You act like you don't believe<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure. It's probably<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Maybe it's just how a different<br>
    species behaves.</p>
  <p> Riker nods thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe. I'm going to stroll the<br>
    ship. You have the bridge. Keep<br>
    an eye on them.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Riker turns and CROSSES to the turbolift, as Wesley<br>
    looks over at the Bynars with a new awareness.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>12 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Riker walks along he sees TASHA, WORF, and some<br>
    other members of the Crew, at the far end of the<br>
    corridor. They are dressed for athletics. Each<br>
    carries a small duffel bag.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We've been challenged to a<br>
    friendly game of Parrises Squares<br>
    by some of the maintenance<br>
    personnel -- want to join us on<br>
    the starbase?</p>
  <p> Riker makes a quick count.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You've already got all the players<br>
    you need.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We can switch off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... if you do that in Parrises<br>
    Squares you lose the rhythm of<br>
    the game.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I can't talk you into coming with<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. But win, all right? The<br>
    pride of the Enterprise goes with<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Rest assured, Commander, we will<br>
    be victorious, at whatever the<br>
    cost.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Worf -- it's just a game. You<br>
    know, a little friendly<br>
    competition -- work up a sweat,<br>
    have some laughs, make new<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with a gleam in his<br>
    eye)<br>
    If winning is not important...<br>
    then, Commander, why keep score?</p>
  <p> Riker can only shrug because he has no answer. Worf<br>
    nods a good-bye, and HEADS OFF with the others. Tasha<br>
    holds back for a beat.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I think he's pulling your leg.<br>
    Believe it or not, Worf's<br>
    developing a sense of humor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's hope so for their sake.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles and shakes his head. Tasha, returns the<br>
    smile, flashes a quick thumbs up... and SPRINTS OFF to<br>
    join the others.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He watches them go for a lonely moment. The area<br>
    SUDDENLY DARKENS. Riker steps over to the com panel.<br>
    He touches the panel, which LIGHTS UP, ILLUMINATING<br>
    HIM.</p>
  <p>14 RIKER AT COMPANEL</p>
  <p> He touches the panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Computer -- There's a power<br>
    reduction in section L-Ninety<br>
    Four. Explain.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER<br>
    Unoccupied sections are being<br>
    closed down in order to clear<br>
    space in the main computer banks.<br>
    It's necessary to facilitate the<br>
    system upgrade. Full power can<br>
    be restored if needed.</p>
  <p> Riker is satisfied. He MOVES OFF.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - CLOSE ON PAINTING</p>
  <p> Its design and form is to be determined, the artist is<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    First tell me what it's supposed<br>
    to be, then I'll give you an<br>
    opinion.</p>
  <p> PULL BACK TO REVEAL Geordi, Data and Riker examining<br>
    the &quot;work of art&quot; which is on an easel set up in the<br>
    Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is an attempt at pure<br>
    creativity.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What we're investigating is, &quot;Can<br>
    Data be creative?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is my attempt... with<br>
    guidance from Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I suggested the Zylo eggs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is that what those are?</p>
  <p> Riker heads for the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Keep notes. This project might<br>
    turn out to be of interest to<br>
    future scholars.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Think about it. A blind man<br>
    teaching an android to paint?<br>
    That's got to be worth a couple<br>
    of pages in someone's book.</p>
  <p> HOLD ON Data and Geordi as Riker waves a cheerful<br>
    good-bye and WALKS OFF.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15A INT. SICKBAY AND CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> BEVERLY is picking up notes and notebooks. She's<br>
    excited almost to the point of being frazzled. Riker<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You look like you're packing up<br>
    and leaving forever.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Oh -- Commander Riker. No -- I'm<br>
    just getting my notes together.<br>
    It's so exciting. Doctor Terence<br>
    Epstein is at this Starbase.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is he someone I should know about?</p>
  <p> He FOLLOWS her OUT into the corridor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's the leading mind in<br>
    cybernetics. He lectured at<br>
    my medical school. Since the<br>
    disaster at Micromius I've been<br>
    working on a theory combining<br>
    cybernetics and regeneration. It<br>
    sounds impossible I know -- but I<br>
    think I have an approach which<br>
    could work. What an opportunity!<br>
    To have a chance to discuss this<br>
    with Doctor Esptein. Sorry, Will,<br>
    I'd like to stay here and chat --<br>
    but I have to be going.</p>
  <p> And she's INTO a turbolift -- leaving Riker standing<br>
    alone.</p>

    by pencil spots. Riker's impressed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very good.</p>
  <p> He turns and nods his appreciation to the Bynars who<br>
    are off to one side watching.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    Very good indeed.</p>
  <p> He STEPS INTO the Holodeck, turns his attention to the<br>

    are fascinated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now, computer -- someone to play<br>
    with. A combo. Say, drums<br>
    upright bass...piano. And a 'bone<br>
    for me.</p>
  <p> And just like that, the bandstand IS POPULATED with a<br>
    jazz combo, including a trombone waiting on the stand.<br>
    NONE OF THE IMAGES MOVE, and they won't until Riker<br>
    activates them.</p>

    of something a little more<br>
    personal...intimate.</p>
  <p> And that quick the room IS EMPTY, SAVE FOR ONE very<br>
    pretty blonde who is sitting alone at a front table.<br>
    Her hand rests lightly on a glass. Her head is turned<br>
    as though expecting someone -- a man to join her. Riker<br>
    is very impressed -- not only by what the computer has<br>
    accomplished, but by the blonde. He turns to the<br>
    Bynars --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Great job, boys.</p>
  <p> The Bynars TALK among themselves in their unique HIGH<br>

    stunning.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    love jazz.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    My name is Minuet. I love all<br>
    jazz except Dixieland.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why not Dixieland?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Because you can't dance to it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My girl.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am going to have to leave you<br>
    for a while and see to my duties.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Your work is very important to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is me -- it's what I am.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Can we dance once before you<br>
    leave?</p>
  <p> The invitation is so effortlessly offered -- and the<br>
    woman so appealing -- who could resist?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sure, why not.</p>
  <p> She rises. He leads her to the little dance floor.</p>
  <p>42 ON THE DANCE FLOOR</p>
  <p> As they STEP ONTO the dance floor, Minuet turns and<br>
    folds herself into his arms. They dance. It's slow<br>
    and sexy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How did you learn to dance so<br>
    well?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    From following you.</p>
  <p> Riker is puzzled and amused at the same time.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    I can anticipate your lead. Tell<br>
    me more about your work -- what<br>
    is it about it that consumes and<br>
    enthralls you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What an interesting choice of<br>
    words. That's exactly what it<br>
    does.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    You are very fortunate.</p>

  <p> MINUET<br>
    At this point in your life to be<br>
    exactly where you want to be...<br>
    And it's wonderful that you<br>
    realize it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd be a fool not to know how<br>
    lucky I am to be on this ship<br>
    serving with this group of people.<br>
    It's a dream come true.</p>
  <p> She snuggles in a little closer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just like this.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    A dream? Is that what this is?<br>
    Is that what I am?</p>
  <p> She fills up his senses. He holds her away, to look<br>
    at her. Her fragrance -- the lightness of her touch.<br>
    Her movement. Riker is becoming captivated by her.<br>
    As a woman can, she senses what he's feeling and leans<br>
    back to look in his eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know you are a computer-generated<br>
    image... but your smell,<br>
    the way you feel, your touch, even<br>
    the way you talk and think is so<br>
    real.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How far can this relationship go?<br>
    I mean, how real are you?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    As real as you need me to be.</p>
  <p> Then a look. To underline her words, she molds herself<br>
    against him.</p>

  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Astounding.</p>
  <p> At the sound of Picard's voice, Riker turns -- a little<br>
    like a kid with his hand in the cookie jar.</p>
  <p>43 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Picard is near the entrance taking it all in. The<br>
    band, the mood, and Riker with a beautiful woman.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS further INTO the room. Minuet is relaxed,<br>
    confident, as she waits.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry, Number One -- I didn't mean<br>
    to interrupt.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all right, come in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You picked a wonderful locale.<br>
    Something I might have chosen<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Aren't you going to introduce me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excuse me. Yes, yes, of course<br>
    I am. Captain Picard, this is<br>
    Minuet... Minuet, this is Captain<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> She steps over to take his hand.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Enchante. Comme c'est merveilleux<br>
    de vous voir ici.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Incroyable! Vous etes Parisienne?</p>
  <p> Riker is surprised that she speaks French and a little<br>
    jealous that she and Picard are hitting it off so well.</p>

    tous Parisienne.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Oui, au fonde nous sommes tous<br>
    Parisienne. The spirit of that<br>
    city can always restore my soul.</p>
  <p> His attitude is a mixture of curiosity, amusement and<br>
    amazement. He, like Riker, is thoroughly captivated by<br>
    Minuet. Her easy grace, her style, her beauty, and the<br>
    fact that she is a figment of a computer's binary<br>
    imagination.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    I have been hoping to meet you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with a look to Riker)<br>
    Oh.<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Have I been a topic of<br>
    conversation?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Indirectly.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles and shrugs.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Join us, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS OVER and sits down at the table.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A glass of wine?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> As she pours.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Will was saying how much he enjoys<br>
    this assignment. It's a credit<br>
    to you. For a ship and crew to<br>
    function well it always starts<br>
    with the captain. You set the<br>
    tone.</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Minuet, graciously)<br>
    At the moment, it's you who are<br>
    setting the tone.<br>
    (then, to Riker)<br>
    The sophistication of this<br>
    programming is remarkable.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    In what way?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Holodeck has been able to give<br>
    us woodlands and ski slopes and<br>
    figures that fight and fictional<br>
    characters with which we can<br>
    interact -- but you are quite<br>
    different. You adapt. You spoke<br>
    French to me.</p>

  <p> MINUET<br>

    even before I'm aware of it<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose it's an understandable<br>
    progression. Computers make<br>
    decisions based on inputs and we<br>
    humans give off many subtle signs<br>
    which communicate our emotions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    turn a corner.</p>
  <p>66 INT. ENTERPRISE - A NEW CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker ENTER a door. It closes behind them,<br>
    FILLING THE SCREEN with the words &quot;WEAPONS ROOM.&quot;</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>67 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves along at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    now know &quot;who&quot; has commandeered<br>
    the Enterprise... the Bynars.<br>
    We can't communicate with the<br>
    bridge. Commander Riker and I will<br>
    now try to regain control of our<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p>68 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> After a moment, they ENTER the corridor tensely --<br>
    armed against the possibility of being met by hostiles.<br>
    Seeing the corridor is clear, Riker turns one way,<br>
    Picard another.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But that's toward Engineering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's our first stop, to verify<br>
    the containment, and initiate<br>
    auto-destruct.</p>
  <p> Riker looks concerned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Initiate auto-destruct?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ship has been commandeered<br>
    by a force of unknown size and<br>
    intent. We're here alone. We<br>
    must assume the worst.</p>
  <p>69 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Picard STEPS TO the wall panel and waits a beat as<br>
    Riker JOINS him. Together they set the auto-destruct<br>
    which requires their specific genetic code in order<br>
    to access the system.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we don't regain control, no<br>
    one else will have it either.<br>
    This is the only decision<br>
    involving the operation of this<br>
    ship which requires you and I to<br>
    agree totally.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's the allotted time that<br>
    concerns me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About that, there is no option.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know. It's a five minute<br>
    countdown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's sufficient to get to the<br>
    bridge... once there, either<br>
    we'll get control of the ship<br>
    and shut off the auto-destruct,<br>
    or we won't. The important thing<br>
    is that this ship does not fall<br>
    into hostile hands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then let's set it and get going.</p>
  <p>70 INT. ENGINEERING - AT COMPUTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This computer is separate from the main computer and<br>
    is used for this type of emergency only.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER<br>

    Captain...<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Recognize Riker, William T,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set auto-destruct sequence.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER<br>
    Does the first officer concur?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... Yes. Set auto-destruct<br>
    sequence -- now!</p>
  <p> A small sign ILLUMINATES &quot;AUTO-DESTRUCT IN (TIME).&quot;</p>
  <p> COMPUTER<br>
    Auto-destruct will detonate in<br>
    four minutes and fifty-nine<br>
    seconds... four minutes and<br>
    fifty-eight seconds... four<br>
    minutes and fifty-seven<br>
    seconds...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's go. The only place we can<br>
    stop the count is from the bridge.</p>
  <p> They start to leave, but Riker spots something on the<br>
    adjacent computer panel.</p>
  <p>70A CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WE SEE a BLUR OF SYMBOLS indicating a high-speed data<br>
    flow.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    What do you make of this?</p>
  <p>70B BY THE SCREEN</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An enormous amount of data is<br>
    being received and stored in the<br>
    main computer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just stored. Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's another piece to this puzzle.</p>
  <p> They leave the computer panel and EXIT.</p>
  <p>71 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker move cautiously forward. The ship<br>
    is quiet.</p>

    73</p>
  <p>74 INT. CORRIDOR NEAR TURBOLIFT NINE</p>
  <p> They reach turbolift nine. The doors do not open.<br>
    Picard punches in a command to bring it. No response.<br>
    The AUTO-DESTRUCT is DISPLAYED on every com panel. This<br>
    one now reads &quot;FOUR MINUTES TEN SECONDS.&quot;</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Access denied.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They've locked it off.</p>
  <p> He thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We've got to find another way to<br>
    get in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One of us could beam onto the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It takes several seconds to<br>
    materialize. You wouldn't<br>
    stand a chance.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I could beam into the turbolift,<br>
    force the doors, and take them<br>
    by surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. We'll beam in simultaneously<br>
    in two different areas of the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Only four minutes left.</p>
  <p> They head for Transporter Room Seven.</p>
  <p>75 INT. STARBASE CONTROL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Restless, the Enterprise crew is hovering around the<br>
    Control Center.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Still no response from the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    They would answer if they could.<br>
    Someone else has control of the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you think I am responsible?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why? How could you have known?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My station is on the bridge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You can't be on the bridge every<br>
    minute.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are wrong, Geordi, I can.<br>
    I do not need rest or diversion<br>
    -- I should not have been painting.<br>
    I was negligent.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    That's a pointless discussion.<br>
    You could have been on the bridge<br>
    and it still might have happened.</p>
  <p> Data snaps her a look of disbelief.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing; to<br>

    You have three ships in here.<br>
    We need one of them now.</p>
  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    We're rushing repairs on the USS<br>
    Melbourne -- but it's still<br>
    eighteen hours until she'll be<br>

  <p>76 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM SEVEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They ARRIVE at the Transporter Room. Riker goes to the<br>
    control panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll set a ten-second delay.</p>
  <p> Picard takes his place on one of the Pads.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Right. Coordinates for Main<br>
    Bridge -- port forward for me and<br>
    aft for you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You're on Pad Two.</p>
  <p> Riker inputs the two sets of coordinates.</p>

  <p>77 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker BEAM INTO the Main Bridge as<br>
    programmed -- he forward and port side, Riker aft.<br>
    They look around, phasers ready.</p>
  <p>78 ANGLE ON BYNARS</p>
  <p> In one corner of the bridge, the Bynars are huddled<br>
    together, pale, cold, almost inert. They seem totally<br>
    lifeless. All have looks of fear. They clearly pose<br>
    no threat.</p>
  <p>79 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He relaxes and moves forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why did you steal my ship?</p>

  <p> near the Bynar's home planet - Bynaus.</p>
  <p>80A CLOSE ON COMPANEL</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker stand in front of it. The auto-destruct<br>
    reads &quot;TWO MINUTES, ONE SECOND.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cancel auto-destruct.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Does the first officer agree?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Affirmative.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Auto-destruct cancelled.</p>
  <p> The red alarm lights STOP FLASHING.</p>
  <p>81 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is by the Bynars who are prone and inert. Riker<br>
    is checking the ship's position at a nearby panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're in orbit around Bynaus.<br>
    (indicating the Bynars)<br>
    How are they?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They appear dead.</p>
  <p> Picard goes to his command chair. Riker continues<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's see if we can get some<br>
    answers from Bynaus.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their main computer is off.<br>
    Sensors reveal all of the<br>
    equipment on the planet is inert.<br>
    They can neither receive nor send<br>
    any messages.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about all the people in that<br>
    world who are totally dependant<br>
    on their computer? Are they still<br>
    functioning?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. They are probably just like<br>
    these Bynars here. Dying.</p>
  <p>82 PICARD</p>
  <p> as he ponders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So, what's this all about? Why<br>
    did they steal the ship and bring<br>
    it here? What was their purpose?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They went to a lot of trouble to<br>
    clear computer space. See what<br>
    they've stored.</p>
  <p>83 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker at the Aft station computer with Picard beside<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, it's enormous. Every<br>
    byte of free space in the computer<br>
    has been filled. They must have<br>
    made a core-dump from their world<br>
    to our computer.</p>
  <p> He inputs something into the computer. The CRT SHOWS<br>
    nothing but GIBBERISH.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can't get in.</p>
  <p> He tries again. The Screen REPAINTS and again is just<br>
    a mass of unintelligible signs and symbols.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>83 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; reading<br>
    the Screen)<br>
    I need a code -- a password -- to<br>
    access the file.</p>
  <p> Picard is both puzzled and concerned. He looks over<br>
    at the Bynars who are still unconscious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They were desperate to steal this<br>
    ship, bring it here to store all<br>
    this information. Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know. I wish they had<br>
    left a note.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps they did.</p>
  <p> Riker instantly connects.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Minuet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe.</p>
  <p>83A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker hurriedly EXIT the turbolift.</p>
  <p>84 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard are in the Holodeck. It's still the<br>
    JAZZ CLUB. As they APPROACH Minuet she UNFREEZES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tell me what this is all about.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    A star in the Bynar system went<br>
    super nova and they miscalculated.<br>
    The electromagnetic pulse from<br>
    the explosion was going to knock<br>
    out their main computer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Their only chance was to transfer<br>
    all the stored information and<br>
    shut down until after it passed.<br>
    Then, reactivate their system and<br>
    transfer the information back to<br>
    this main computer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And the Enterprise has the only<br>
    mobile computer large enough to<br>
    handle all that information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So what went wrong?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    The star went super nova before<br>
    it was expected and you were late<br>
    arriving at Starbase 74.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But why steal the ship? Why<br>
    didn't they say something? Why<br>
    didn't they just ask for help?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I don't know. I don't have those<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there anything we can do?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Yes. Return the data stored in the<br>
    Enterprise's computer back to the<br>
    one on Bynaus.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do we do that?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Don't you know?</p>
  <p> Riker shakes his head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. If we had the file name.<br>
    But we don't. Do you?</p>

  <p> MINUET<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about. No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They wouldn't intentionally hide<br>
    it or make it difficult for us<br>
    to find. It's got to be right<br>
    in front of us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    We should call Starbase 74, and<br>
    see if anyone can decipher this.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    (emotionally)<br>
    Hurry. They're dying.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    They meant you no harm. It was<br>

  <p> QUINTEROS<br>
    This is Starbase 74. Captain<br>
    Picard, what's your situation?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll get into that later. Right<br>
    now I must speak with Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Data.</p>

  <p>85A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am here, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, the Bynars have stored an<br>
    enormous amount of information<br>
    in the computer. We can't access<br>
    it, and we must.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The access would be available by<br>
    code or password.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know, but what could it be?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    File names can be anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They want us to find it. They<br>
    would have kept it simple.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then a name -- or a place. It<br>
    could be personal. In this case<br>
    in binary language which is ones<br>
    and zeros in groups of eight or<br>
    sixteen characters.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at the prone figures.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could it be that simple?<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Try it.</p>
  <p>86 RIKER AT COMPUTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> He sets up the program. The CRT SCREEN DISPLAYS a<br>
    PATTERN and starts running COMBINATIONS OF ONES AND<br>
    ZEROS until it gets to -- 11001001 -- then the SCREEN<br>
    LOCKS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's the file. It'll work now.</p>
  <p> They exchange a visual equivalent of a High Five.</p>

  <p>86 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well done, Will. Now access the<br>
    file and start the transfer.</p>
  <p> Riker attempts to do just that. Again the CRT<br>
    REPAINTS, and this time it's filled with GIBBERISH.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So much for that idea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me get on the other position.<br>
    The Bynars always work in pairs,<br>
    perhaps that is also required.</p>
  <p> Now together they input the information. There is a<br>
    pause. Both think it's not working -- then the SCREEN<br>
    LOCKS, the LIGHTS DIM, the computer HUMS and starts<br>
    PUMPING OUT tons of binary info.</p>
  <p>87 OMITTED</p>
  <p>88 INT. - BACK TO MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In the dim light, Riker and Picard watch as the CRT<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    It appears to be successful. The<br>

  <p>88 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their reason is part of their<br>
    binary thinking -- for them there<br>
    are only two choices -- one or zero<br>
    -- yes or no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No one's been hurt. They<br>
    accomplished their objective.<br>
    They have their world back in<br>
    order, and we have our ship.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the position at the Conn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's been some time since I had<br>
    the Conn.</p>
  <p> He taps in the coordinates.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But, not to worry, Number One<br>
    you're in good hands. Starbase<br>
    74 -- at warp two.</p>
  <p> He taps in the speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> Riker looks on with a smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Under complete control.</p>
  <p>88A EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE ENTERING STARBASE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship APPROACHES, then DOCKS. (As before.)</p>
  <p>88B INT. STARBASE CONTROL</p>
  <p> The crewmembers of the Enterprise watch with elation<br>
    as their ship REDOCKS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>88C INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Both turbolift doors OPEN and the crew POURS ONTO the<br>
    bridge. Beverly, Wesley, Geordi, Data, Tasha and Worf<br>
    ENTER and gather around Riker and Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are all right, everything is<br>
    fine. Now -- I want a complete<br>
    check of all systems and<br>
    divisions.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What about the Bynars?</p>
  <p> She indicates the four Bynars gathered together off<br>
    to one side.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Turn them over to Quinteros.<br>
    (to the Bynars)<br>
    There will be a hearing.</p>
  <p> ZERO ONE<br>
    We understood that...</p>
  <p> ONE ZERO<br>
    ... would happen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That being the case -- permission<br>
    to leave the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Permission granted.</p>
  <p>89 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Riker is at the computer panel. Riker punches in the<br>
    code.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER<br>
    Program entered - you may enter<br>
    the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS. The scene is the same. &quot;Minuet&quot; is at<br>
    the table. Riker is very relieved. Her face is turned<br>
    away -- she is motionless and will be until Riker sits<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;11001001&quot; - 11/19/87 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>90 ANGLE ON TABLE</p>
  <p> Riker sits down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's a knockout like you doin'<br>
    in a computer-generated joint like<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> The woman turns -- she looks a lot like Minuet -- but<br>
    it is clearly not Minuet.</p>
  <p>91 RIKER</p>
  <p> The disappointment etched on his face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're not Minuet.</p>
  <p>92 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS and CROSSES to the Ops position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She's gone. I tried variations<br>
    of the program, others appeared,<br>
    but not Minuet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe that too, was part of the<br>
    Bynar's program. Some<br>
    relationships just can't work.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (he can agree<br>
    intellectually, but<br>
    emotionally it's not<br>
    easy)<br>
    Yes... probably true... but, she<br>
    will be difficult to forget.</p>
  <p>93 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As she heads AWAY.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
