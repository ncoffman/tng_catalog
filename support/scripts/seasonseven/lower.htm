    &quot;Lower Decks&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> TROI and RIKER are sitting at a table looking over a<br>
    PADD. The usual complement of N.D's fill the room.</p>
  <p> A waiter stands at a nearby table, wiping it clean.<br>
    His name is BEN, and though Riker and Troi don't<br>
    notice, he's eavesdropping on their conversation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fletcher has more experience with<br>
    propulsion systems --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But Carstairs is better with<br>
    people. Considering this is a<br>
    supervisory position, I'd go with<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considers)<br>
    You're probably right...</p>
  <p> Riker works the PADD, leans back and rubs his eyes as<br>
    if they're tired.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Didn't we just finish a Crew<br>
    Evaluation Report?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That was three months ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Feels like three weeks. Maybe we<br>
    should just give everyone a<br>
    promotion and call it a night.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    What do you say... Commander?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Fine with me... Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing a table in the corner from which four junior<br>
    officers are watching Riker and Troi -- who can be seen<br>
    in the background laughing over something one of them<br>
    has said.</p>
  <p> Two of them are recognizable: ALYSSA OGAWA, Beverly's<br>
    Nurse, and Ensign SITO JAXA, the young Bajoran woman<br>
    from &quot;First Duty.&quot; As we'll see, the Nova Squadron<br>
    incident has left Sito a little unsure of herself;<br>
    determined to get her career back on track but<br>
    desperate to avoid making another mistake, she's become<br>
    very cautious, very by-the-book.</p>
  <p> The group is rounded out by a Vulcan male named TAURIK<br>
    and a human male named LAVELLE. Like Sito, they are<br>
    both in their early to mid-twenties. Lavelle is<br>
    bright, handsome and personable -- think of Riker<br>
    twelve years ago. Taurik is extremely intelligent and<br>
    knows it -- he has enormous confidence in his own<br>
    abilities.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Why do they keep laughing? What's<br>
    so funny about Crew Evaluations?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Don't worry about it, Sam.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Let's just try and have a good<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    How can I have a good time when my<br>
    career's being decided across the<br>
    room?</p>
  <p> Lavelle crosses his fingers, closes his eyes...</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing, quiet)<br>
    Think promotion... promotion...<br>
    promotion...</p>
  <p> Taurik regards him disapprovingly.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    You can't really believe this will<br>
    influence the outcome of your<br>
    evaluation?</p>
  <p> Lavelle ignores him, continues his quiet chant. The<br>
    others see Taurik's annoyance and can't resist teasing<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    It's a time-honored strategy,<br>
    Taurik.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    The Vedeks of the Janalan order<br>
    maintain a round-the-clock chant<br>
    for the well-being of the Bajoran<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Considering the history of your<br>
    planet, that doesn't exactly<br>
    validate what he's doing.</p>
  <p> Sito shrugs to concede him the point, but Lavelle is<br>
    finally exasperated by the relentlessness of Taurik's<br>
    logic. The efficacy of what Sam is doing is<br>
    questionable.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Promote me, please -- so I can<br>
    make Lieutenant and have my own<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    If you aren't happy sharing<br>
    quarters with me, then you should<br>
    put in for a new room assignment.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Just in case you're not promoted.</p>
  <p> Sito and Ogawa smile at Taurik's remark.</p>
  <p>3 ON RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> Ben is approaching them with TWO COFFEES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been thinking about who to<br>
    promote to Ops --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The new night duty officer?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Lavelle's an obvious candidate,<br>
    but I'm considering Ensign Sito as<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> Ben sets the coffees down.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    You sure about dessert?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. Don't tempt me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Ben smiles and moves off; we FOLLOW HIM as he<br>
    approaches the junior officer's table.</p>
  <p> Ben is about the same age as the others; has an easy<br>
    smile and wit. He signed aboard a Starship for fun and<br>
    adventure, and as a civilian, isn't subject to the<br>
    pressures of Starfleet. He likes nothing more than to<br>
    kid his friends about how seriously they take<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Are they working on the crew<br>
    evaluations?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Yep.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Who were they talking about?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    It's not my place to say...</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Come on, Ben.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    All right, but I'm not sure you're<br>
    going to like it...</p>
  <p> They react --</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Apparently... you're both up for<br>
    the same job...</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts. Sito and Lavelle look at each<br>
    other... wondering how this will affect their<br>
    friendship... Off this moment we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> At Red Alert, Sito is at Tactical, Lavelle at the Conn,<br>
    DATA at Ops -- Riker is giving a series of rapid-fire<br>
    orders from the Command Area. Various N.D's as needed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lock phasers on target --</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (works)<br>
    Phasers locked --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The enemy vessel is firing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Helm, hard to starboard!</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (works)<br>
    Hard starboard --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fire phasers!</p>
  <p> Sito works the console but it takes her a moment to<br>
    comply -- Worf turns from the aft station to watch as<br>
    she recovers and fires.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Firing --</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND of phasers firing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Target is destroyed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    End simulation sequence and secure<br>
    from drill.</p>
  <p> Red Alert ends and Riker studies a read-out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing, to all)<br>
    Alpha shift, your response time<br>
    was seven percent slower than<br>
    gamma shift --</p>
  <p> Everyone on the Bridge reacts to this disappointing<br>
    news.</p>
  <p>4A INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> where Taurik, Geordi, and a few N.D's are listening.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'd like all departments to submit<br>
    drill evaluation reports by oh<br>
    nine hundred hours --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ensign, you'll write that report.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>4B INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Continuous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's see if we can find a way to<br>
    close that gap.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Sito.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What happened back there, Ensign?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Sito explains, a little nervously.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I'm sorry, sir. When we changed<br>
    course I had to re-lock the<br>
    phasers before I could fire.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Next time try letting the locking<br>
    relay float until the actual order<br>
    to fire is given.</p>
  <p> Sito acknowledges.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They may not teach that trick at<br>
    the Academy, but it works.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Lavelle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lavelle...</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> There is a moment of anticipation on Lavelle's face, as<br>
    if he's hoping to be complimented.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Resume previous course and speed.</p>
  <p> A flicker of disappointment crosses Lavelle's features.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (all business)<br>
    Aye, aye sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One &quot;aye&quot; is sufficient<br>
    acknowledgment, Ensign.</p>
  <p> Lavelle's face flushes with embarrassment. PICARD<br>
    ENTERS from the Ready Room and approaches Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Helm, change course for the Argaya<br>
    system -- maximum warp.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about our rendezvous with the<br>
    Clement?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've just received new orders from<br>
    Starfleet. We'll discuss it in<br>
    the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> Data stands to join Picard and Worf as they cross<br>
    toward the Observation Lounge. Lavelle looks over at<br>
    Data's vacant chair -- someone is going to have to man<br>
    Ops and he hopes he is chosen. Riker glances at him,<br>
    then back toward Sito.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign Sito, you'll fill in at<br>
    Ops.</p>
  <p> Lavelle tries not to show his disappointment.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> She crosses toward the chair as the senior officers<br>
    EXIT into the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> She takes a seat and orients herself, pushes a few<br>
    controls. It's an awkward moment; the two friends are<br>
    still grappling with the fact that they're competitors,<br>
    and now they have to sit side by side. She senses<br>
    Lavelle's disappointment that he wasn't chosen and<br>
    tries to steer the conversation elsewhere.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing, quiet)<br>
    The Argaya system is close to the<br>
    Cardassian border; I wonder why<br>
    we're going there.</p>
  <p> He shrugs, doesn't join in her speculation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4B CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How would you like to be a spider<br>
    under that table?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (turns to her)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (gesturing back toward<br>
    the Observation lounge)<br>
    A spider under the table --</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Is that like a fly on the wall?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I guess so.</p>
  <p> He smiles -- the awkwardness between them evaporates.<br>
    (NOTE: as they talk, they should occasionally work<br>
    their controls.)</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You did really well during the<br>
    drill.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Apparently Commander Riker didn't<br>
    think so. I swear he's got it in<br>
    for me.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    You're imagining things.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Oh, yeah? Then how come you're<br>
    sitting in that chair instead of<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> Sito tries to make light of it.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Maybe he figured I need more<br>
    practice than you do.</p>
  <p> He smiles and they turn their attentions to their<br>
    consoles... Off this moment...</p>
  <p>5 OMITTED</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Taurik is working at the pool table; GEORDI ENTERS and<br>
    starts to cross past.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Excuse me, sir... do you have a<br>
    minute?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure. What is it?</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    I'd like you to take a look at<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles slightly. Apparently this isn't unusual<br>
    for Taurik.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Have you been improvising again,<br>
    Ensign?</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    In a manner of speaking. I'm<br>
    running a computer simulation to<br>
    test a new warp-field<br>
    configuration.</p>
  <p> Geordi studies the console indicated by Taurik.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You've got a problem right here...<br>
    the plasma flow in the nacelles is<br>
    out of sync.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Actually, sir, that was done<br>
    deliberately.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts; clearly this isn't how it's ordinarily<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As you can see, this configuration<br>
    has increased overall warp-field<br>
    integrity by seven percent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    You're right...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Doctor Nils Diaz has been<br>
    experimenting with this technique<br>
    at the Tanaline Propulsion<br>
    Laboratory.</p>
  <p> Geordi is studying the read-outs.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know his work, but I never heard<br>
    anything about this...</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    His findings have not been<br>
    released yet. I was able to<br>
    review a preliminary report when<br>
    I was at the Academy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll look forward to reading about<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    I predict that when these findings<br>
    are made public, they will become<br>
    a new model for warp field<br>
    operation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sounds interesting.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    With your permission, I would like<br>
    to begin tests to see if the<br>
    technique can be adapted to our<br>
    warp drive.</p>
  <p> Geordi studies the monitor as he considers...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know... There could be<br>
    variables you didn't account for.</p>
  <p> Taurik considers the possibility.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    I was quite thorough.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm sure you were... but I'd like<br>
    to look over your simulation<br>
    before I authorize any tests.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If you have any other ideas for<br>
    improving efficiency, feel free to<br>
    run them by me.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    As a matter of fact, sir, I do --<br>
    when would be a good time to<br>
    discuss them?</p>
  <p> The only reason Geordi restrains himself is because he<br>
    asked for it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll get back to you on that...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves off; Taurik watches him go for a beat<br>
    before setting to work...</p>
  <p>7 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Ogawa ministers to an N.D. PATIENT on a bio-bed, then<br>
    moves toward Beverly's Office. She stops at the door<br>
    and waits for BEVERLY to look up from her desk.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly sees her and smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If you're wondering about your<br>
    evaluation, it couldn't be better.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Actually, I just wanted to tell<br>
    you that Ensign Reilly's condition<br>
    is showing improvement... but<br>
    thank you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In fact, I'm recommending you for<br>
    a promotion. How does Lieutenant<br>
    Alyssa Ogawa sound to you?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    It sounds wonderful.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll talk to Commander Riker... I<br>
    expect it'll be official as soon<br>
    as the current crew evaluation is<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> Ogawa smiles and turns to exit...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alyssa... I've been meaning to ask<br>
    you -- how are things going with<br>
    you and Lieutenant Powell?</p>
  <p> There is a brief hesitation.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Fine... I think.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You think?</p>
  <p> Ogawa takes a breath... she's trying to be casual about<br>
    this, but there's an undercurrent of concern.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I'm sure it's nothing... but he<br>
    seems... preoccupied lately. Last<br>
    night he had to cancel our date.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/29/93 - ACT ONE 12A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I know he's been putting together<br>
    a research proposal... he's been<br>
    really busy with it...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can understand that. Sometimes<br>
    I get so absorbed in my research<br>
    I forget to eat.</p>
  <p> Ogawa still seems concerned.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I just wonder...</p>
  <p> She trails off, but Beverly knows she wants to talk.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I've never met anyone like Andrew.<br>
    It's as though we've known each<br>
    other forever...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You do seem well-suited.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    But... I know that in the<br>
    beginning of a romance... it's<br>
    possible to be... a little blind.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    I'm not sure exactly what you<br>
    mean...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Well... cancelling a date like<br>
    that... the way he's been so<br>
    distant lately...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doctor... do you think those could<br>
    be warning signs? That he's<br>
    losing interest?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alyssa... I think you may be<br>
    overreacting.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Maybe so...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/29/93 - ACT ONE 12B.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If I felt as strongly about<br>
    someone as you do about Andrew --<br>
    he'd have to do a lot more than<br>
    cancel one date before I became<br>
    suspicious.</p>
  <p> Ogawa can't help but smile.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    You're right...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As soon as this research project<br>
    is over... I'm sure things will be<br>
    just like they were.</p>
  <p> Cheered, Ogawa puts a final bright spin on things.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Except, of course, that he'll have<br>
    to deal with Lieutenant Ogawa.</p>
  <p> And she EXITS, smiling.</p>

  <p>9 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Sito is standing at the bar talking with Worf. A<br>
    smaller than usual number of N.D's are in the room.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I only filled in at Ops for half<br>
    an hour, but I had to degauss the<br>
    main deflector dish, recalibrate<br>
    the navigation grid, and use the<br>
    internal sensors to find a lost<br>
    puppy.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ops is a very different challenge<br>
    from Tactical.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I can't figure out why I'm even<br>
    being considered for the<br>
    assignment... I'm a security<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> Worf regards her for a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I recommended you.</p>
  <p> Sito is surprised and gratified to hear this.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I'll try not to let you down, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>10 ON LAVELLE, TAURIK AND BEN</p>
  <p> who are at the same table we saw them at before,<br>
    watching Sito and Worf. Ben stands with an empty tray --<br>
    there aren't many people in Ten Forward so he has time<br>
    to talk.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    What could they be talking about?</p>
  <p> Taurik's had enough of Lavelle's trying to eavesdrop.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Have you ever considered learning<br>
    to lip read?</p>
  <p> Ben smiles at Taurik's comment, but Lavelle ignores his<br>
    remark.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Do you think Worf's chewing her<br>
    out?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    No, he always looks like that.</p>
  <p> There's a trace of envy in Lavelle's voice:</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Maybe he's giving her pointers on<br>
    how to land the Ops position.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and Riker ENTERS; he glances their way<br>
    when he crosses past their table.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Hi, Wil.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a greeting)<br>
    Ben...</p>
  <p> When Riker crosses away Lavelle looks at Ben in<br>
    disbelief.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    You call him Wil?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT ONE 14A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    He's second in command of this<br>
    ship, that's why not.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    I'm not Starfleet; I'm a civilian.<br>
    And when he's in here, he wants to<br>
    be treated like a civilian.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Riker? I bet he sleeps in his<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    You only think that because he's<br>
    your C.O. If you got to know him --</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> Ben isn't sure why Lavelle's reacting like this.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    (to Ben)<br>
    He's convinced that Commander<br>
    Riker doesn't &quot;like&quot; him.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Why? Did you crash the ship into<br>
    something?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    No. He just doesn't like me.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    He doesn't even know you.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    That's right. You should go talk<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Perhaps something you have in<br>
    common?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    He likes Jazz... poker... he's<br>
    Canadian --</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Yeah? My grandfather was from<br>
    Canada.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    There you go.</p>
  <p> Sito approaches the table; in the background, we see<br>
    that Worf is EXITING Ten Forward.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Hi --</p>
  <p> She sees that there's no chair for her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 15A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Here...</p>
  <p> He stands and frees his chair for her.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've got to go talk to somebody.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> We follow Lavelle as he moves off, drink in hand. He<br>
    steels himself, then moves to the bar next to Riker.<br>
    Riker is working on a PADD and doesn't notice him.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Good evening, sir...</p>
  <p> Riker turns toward him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lavelle...</p>
  <p> Lavelle smiles awkwardly, unsure what to say. Riker<br>
    regards him for a beat, wondering if he wants<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can I do something for you?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    No, sir. I... just came to get<br>
    myself another drink.</p>
  <p> Riker glances down at the drink Lavelle's already<br>
    holding in his hand -- it's nearly full.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something wrong with that one?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Actually, I...</p>
  <p> The Bartender approaches.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing, to Riker)<br>
    What are you having?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Trakian Ale.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Good choice.<br>
    (to bartender)<br>
    I'll have one, too.</p>
  <p> Riker returns to his PADD. After a beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    My Grandfather was Canadian, you<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really...</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Aren't you one, too?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A grandfather?</p>
  <p> Lavelle laughs, maybe a little too much.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Canadian, sir. Canadian.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I grew up in Alaska.</p>
  <p> Lavelle's smile fades as he realizes his plan is<br>
    collapsing.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Oh. Well... they both... get a<br>
    lot of snow.</p>
  <p> Riker isn't sure what to say to this; he returns to his<br>
    PADD. An awkward beat as Lavelle decides to get out<br>
    before he gets himself in any deeper.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good talking to you, sir.</p>
  <p> Lavelle moves off, mortified by the whole encounter --<br>
    a beat later the bartender arrives with his ale. He<br>
    looks at Riker, who glances after Lavelle and shakes<br>
    his head.</p>

  <p> Picard acknowledges, turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anything?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    No, sir. I detect no vessels in<br>
    the vicinity.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a concerned look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How close are we to the Cardassian<br>

  <p> DATA<br>

    Less than five thousand<br>

  <p> To Lavelle this all sounds very mysterious.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir... I am detecting an object...<br>
    five meters in length.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It appears to be an escape pod.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They must have been forced to<br>
    abandon ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How far inside Cardassian space is<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Over fifty thousand kilometers.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker share a grim look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How the hell are we going to get<br>
    it out of there... ?</p>
  <p> Off Lavelle's face -- he doesn't know what this<br>
    mysterious escape pod contains, but clearly it's<br>
    important to us...</p>

  <p> OGAWA<br>

    I better go.</p>
  <p> She EXITS down the corridor. Picard approaches and<br>

  <p> She acknowledges and the door OPENS to admit him. But<br>
    he stops before going in, turns back to look at Sito.<br>
    He regards her for a beat without saying anything, then<br>
    turns and EXITS to Sickbay. Sito is left wondering<br>
    what the look might have meant...</p>
  <p>18 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is near an aft station, Data at Ops, Worf at<br>
    tactical and Lavelle at the Conn. A group of N.D's<br>
    ENTER from the Turbolift and stand ready to take their<br>
    posts. Riker glances to see if everyone's present,<br>
    then announces:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Twelve hundred hours -- alpha<br>
    shift is relieved...</p>
  <p> The other N.D's move from their posts and EXIT to the<br>
    Turbolifts, but Lavelle approaches Riker.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Excuse me, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to him.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If it's all right with you, I'd<br>
    like to stay on for another shift.<br>
    I could use the training.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now's not the best time.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Lavelle moves to the Turbolift... it OPENS and he goes<br>
    inside. As the door closes, we catch a glimpse of his<br>
    frustrated expression...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CORRIDOR</p>

    until the door to Sickbay OPENS and Picard steps out --<br>
    without breaking stride:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Surprised by his request, it takes her a beat to follow<br>
    in step. They move down the corridor in silence, and<br>
    stop when they reach the Turbolift door. After a<br>
    moment it OPENS and Lavelle and another N.D EXIT.</p>
  <p> Lavelle's surprised to see her with Picard, and he and<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're a certified pilot, aren't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>

    thoughts. Sito can only wonder what the question might<br>
    portend.</p>
  <p>21 INT. READY ROOM</p>

    I do, sir.</p>
  <p> Sito is wondering if she's about to be promoted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not so sure. Your record<br>
    concerns me.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The incident you were involved in<br>
    at the Academy.</p>
  <p> Sito blanches; this is her greatest fear come to life --<br>
    that people will never forget the mistake she made.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    With all due respect... that was<br>
    three years ago. My record since<br>
    then --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I'm not certain it matters how<br>
    long it's been. What I need to<br>
    know is whether you would ever do<br>
    something like that again.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I can assure you, sir, I would<br>
    never, never jeopardize lives by<br>
    participating in --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (cutting her off)<br>
    A dare-devil stunt? I should hope<br>
    not. What concerns me more is<br>
    that you participated in a coverup<br>
    that impeded an official<br>
    investigation into the death of a<br>
    cadet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> From Sito's point of view she's being dressed-down; but<br>
    Picard's tone, the fact that he so uncharacteristically<br>
    interrupted her, is indicative that there is more going<br>
    on here. He's testing her mettle, much like he did<br>
    Hugh's in &quot;I, Borg.&quot; Why he's doing it remains a<br>
    mystery.</p>
  <p> She stammers as she tries to explain.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Sir, I know I should have told the<br>
    truth right from the start --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you didn't. You went along<br>
    with the others and pretended that<br>
    what happened was nothing more<br>
    than an accident. What do you<br>
    suppose that tells me about your<br>
    character?</p>
  <p> She's completely flustered now.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Sir, if you had any idea what it<br>
    was like after that incident -- I<br>
    didn't have any friends, anyone to<br>
    talk to. I had to take my flighttest<br>
    with the instructor because<br>
    no one else would be my partner.<br>
    In a lot of ways it would have<br>
    been easier to just walk away.<br>
    But I didn't. I stuck with it.<br>
    Doesn't that say something about<br>
    my character, too... ?</p>
  <p> Picard's tone is dismissively sarcastic.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm very sorry you didn't enjoy<br>
    your time at the Academy, Ensign.<br>
    But as far as I'm concerned, you<br>
    should have been expelled for what<br>
    you did. Quite frankly, I don't<br>
    know how you made it onto my ship.</p>

  <p> He leans back, waits for her to defend herself. But<br>
    she's so rattled by what he's said, she can't. Picard<br>
    regards her for a long moment... then, almost as if<br>
    he's disappointed by her inability to reply:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're dismissed...</p>
  <p> She turns and EXITS. Off Picard's expression as he<br>
    watches her go...</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>22 INT. SHUTTLEBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Taurik is taking aim with a PHASER RIFLE. He FIRES and<br>
    we reveal that he is shooting at a SHUTTLECRAFT sitting<br>
    in the bay. Geordi stands nearby with a TRICORDER and<br>
    watches as the BEAM hits the shuttle's aft section.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Two more seconds...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's enough.</p>
  <p> A SCORCH MARK now mars the shuttle's stern. Geordi<br>
    scans it with the tricorder. Other scorch marks are<br>
    visible on the hull.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Sir, I'm a little puzzled. Why<br>
    are we intentionally damaging this<br>
    shuttlecraft?</p>
  <p> A brief hesitation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're evaluating hull resiliency.<br>
    Starfleet requires periodic<br>
    testing.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    I see.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't believe I'm familiar with<br>
    that requirement.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (somewhat pointedly)<br>
    Probably because you're not a<br>
    senior officer.</p>
  <p> Taurik acknowledges this. But --</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    If you wish, I can reconfigure the<br>
    phaser to fire a low-intensity<br>
    burst that would not harm the<br>
    shuttle's hull. The test<br>
    procedure would not be affected.</p>
  <p> Oddly, Geordi dismisses what seems a good idea.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/29/93 - ACT THREE 27A.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's fine the way it is. Just<br>
    give me a four second burst right<br>
    about here.</p>
  <p> He indicates a point on the nacelle. Taurik moves to<br>
    take up position.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Should I fire from this position?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Actually...<br>
    (he gestures)<br>
    Make it over there.</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates that Taurik take up position a few<br>
    yards in another direction.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    That would be consistent...</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and looks at Taurik.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Consistent with what?</p>
  <p> Taurik considers a beat before replying.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    With making it appear that this<br>
    shuttle fled an attack.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't help but frown when he realizes Taurik<br>
    knows exactly what they're really up to.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What makes you think that's what<br>
    we're doing?</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    The pattern of fire you have asked<br>
    for is similar to what might<br>
    result if the shuttle were fleeing<br>
    an attacker while engaging in<br>
    evasive maneuvers.</p>
  <p> Geordi regards him with a poker-face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's quite a coincidence...</p>
  <p> Taurik understands that Geordi is asking him to stop<br>
    asking questions and go along with the official story.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    Yes, sir. It is indeed. Shall we<br>
    proceed with the testing?</p>
  <p> Geordi's face shows that he's glad that Taurik<br>
    understands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, Ensign. Thank you.</p>
  <p> As Taurik takes up position for the next phaser shot...</p>
  <p>23 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> as Ogawa ENTERS. Beverly approaches her with a certain<br>
    amount of urgency.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alyssa... thanks for coming so<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> They start toward the main room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We need to prepare for surgery.<br>
    We have a comatose patient with a<br>
    subdeural hematoma.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Beverly stops, turns to her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I want to make it clear that you<br>
    are not to discuss what you see<br>
    here with anyone.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> When they cross into the main room Ogawa reacts to what<br>
    she sees on the center bio-bed -- an unconscious<br>
    Cardassian male of about forty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We'll need to synthesize at least<br>
    a liter of Cardassian blood...</p>
  <p> It takes Ogawa a beat to recover, then she and Beverly<br>
    set to work...</p>
  <p>24 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p>25 INT. LAVELLE/TAURIK'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Sito, Ogawa, Lavelle, Taurik and Ben are playing<br>
    five-card stud at a table in the middle of the room.</p>
  <p> This is a re-dress of our windowless quarters, and we<br>
    should get the feeling that they're smaller than Worf's<br>
    or Geordi's. The two men have pretty much divided the<br>
    room in two, with their beds against opposite walls.</p>
  <p> Taurik's half is neat and orderly, with Vulcan<br>
    artifacts displayed. Lavelle's half is a bit of a mess --<br>
    a soccer ball, an Anbo-jitsu stick, and other trappings<br>
    of a single man are carelessly strewn about.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Ben expertly shuffles the deck and deals one card down,<br>
    then one up -- starting with Lavelle, then to Ogawa,<br>
    Taurik and finally Sito. While he deals they each<br>
    assess their hand and the following conversation plays:</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    What I can't figure out is why<br>
    we're just sitting here so close<br>
    to the Cardassian border.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    It must have something to do with<br>
    that escape pod we picked up.<br>
    (to Sito)<br>
    Don't you think?</p>
  <p> Sito shrugs that she doesn't know.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Maybe...</p>
  <p> She's still reeling from her encounter with Picard; her<br>
    friends have noticed that her mind is elsewhere, but<br>
    they don't know why.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    I wonder who was in it... ?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    You know what I heard... ?</p>
  <p> The others turn to Ben. After a dramatic pause:</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It was Ambassador Spock.</p>
  <p> None of the others believe this for a second.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    That is unlikely.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    That's what I was told...</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    By whom?</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    I can't say.</p>
  <p> Lavelle shrugs Ben off and continues trying to<br>
    speculate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT THREE 30A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    They beamed whoever was in it<br>
    right to Sickbay.<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Did you see anything when you went<br>
    down there?</p>
  <p> For possibly the first time, Ogawa is having to keep<br>
    something from her friends.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    No... Doctor Crusher just wanted<br>
    me to help her with the lab<br>
    schedule.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    I thought Lieutenant Powell was<br>
    going to join us tonight?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    He had to do a double shift.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    That's too bad...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    He's the worst poker player I've<br>
    ever met...</p>
  <p> Ogawa smiles and shrugs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Ben turns to Lavelle, who is showing the highest card.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    It's your bet, Sam.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Riker, Beverly, Troi, Worf and Geordi are also<br>
    playing poker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (bets)<br>
    Twenty.</p>
  <p> The others match his bet, and Geordi deals another card<br>
    face up to each player (they too show one down and one<br>
    up).</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    -- the thing is, I saw Powell in<br>
    Ten Forward with another woman...<br>
    the way they were talking made me<br>
    wonder...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He should tell Alyssa if he's<br>
    seeing someone else. Even if it<br>
    hurts her, it'll be better in the<br>
    long run.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been meaning to tell you<br>
    something, Worf... I don't think<br>
    Ensign Sito is ready for the Ops<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I must say that I disagree, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi nudges Troi because she shows the highest hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm listening...</p>
  <p> Troi tosses in a chip --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>27 INT. LAVELLE/TAURIK'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as a chip lands in the pile at the center of the table.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    The bet is fifty --</p>
  <p> Everyone matches the bet --</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    (to Sito)<br>
    It would be illogical for the<br>
    Captain to deny you a promotion<br>
    because of something you did as a<br>
    cadet.</p>
  <p> These are difficult things for Sito to talk about.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    He said it shows I don't have<br>
    character.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    What did you say?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    What could I say?<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Maybe he's right...</p>
  <p> Lavelle reacts strongly to this.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    You're a damn fine officer and you<br>
    deserve that post as much as<br>
    anyone.</p>
  <p> This is the kind of thing she needs to hear and it<br>
    helps her shake her gloom a little.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    One thing's for sure -- I won't be<br>
    getting it. Not if it's up to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>28 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    It is your decision, sir -- but if<br>
    you give her a chance to prove<br>
    herself, I feel certain that<br>
    Ensign Sito will not disappoint<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right, Worf. I'll keep her<br>
    under consideration.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Besides, I have my doubts about<br>
    Lavelle.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Really? Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's too... eager to please. He<br>
    keeps trying to ingratiate himself<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why assume he's doing it just to<br>
    get the job?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles; he's sure he's right about Lavelle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    I'll see your fifty and raise you<br>
    a hundred.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know... It seems to me<br>
    that you and Lavelle have a lot in<br>
    common.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What? We're not at all alike.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    You're bluffing.</p>

  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (to Ben)<br>
    Think so?</p>
  <p> Ben regards him for a beat, then bets.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Yes, and I'm not gonna let you get<br>
    away with it.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    (to Lavelle)<br>
    You know, Sam, maybe you shouldn't<br>
    try so hard with Riker. It<br>
    doesn't matter whether he likes<br>
    you... as long as he respects you.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    And he must... otherwise he<br>
    wouldn't be considering you for<br>
    the Ops position.</p>
  <p> Sam considers their words for a moment.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    You're probably right... maybe I'm<br>
    just telling myself he hates me so<br>
    if I don't get promoted I'll have<br>
    an excuse.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    (to Taurik)<br>
    Well? You in or not?</p>
  <p> Taurik is studying his cards intently.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    At this juncture, the odds of my<br>
    winning this hand are less than<br>
    thirty-nine to one. I fold.</p>
  <p> He sets his cards down.</p>

    Looks like it's just you and me,<br>
    buddy. You in for another fifty?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Give me a minute. I'm thinking.</p>
  <p> Geordi studies Riker's face to see if he's bluffing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Didn't you tell me you took up<br>
    poker so you could get into the<br>
    officer's game on the Potemkin?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I happen to like poker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But your senior officers might<br>
    have thought you were trying to<br>
    ingratiate yourself -- I guess<br>
    they realized you were just young<br>
    and inexperienced and decided not<br>
    to hold it against you.</p>
  <p> Riker is struck by her words; he regards Troi for a<br>
    moment, then nods that he sees her point.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe I am being too hard on<br>
    Lavelle...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    I do not believe he is bluffing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I do.<br>
    (bets)<br>
    What've you got?</p>
  <p> Geordi shows a respectable hand. Riker plays the<br>
    moment for all it's worth, then shows his cards -- he<br>
    wasn't bluffing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't believe this.</p>

  <p> BEN<br>
    Of course he was.</p>

    damaged my relationship with him?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    It depends on what kind of guy he<br>
    is.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Ante up, gentlemen.</p>
  <p> Taurik doesn't know what to make of all this. Suddenly<br>
    the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Geordi -- much to everyone's<br>
    surprise.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Commander --</p>
  <p> Taurik and Lavelle start to stand, but Geordi gestures<br>
    it's okay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't get up. I just dropped by<br>
    to see Taurik.</p>
  <p> Taurik stands and approaches him.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    What can I do for you, sir?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm headed for Engineering to run<br>
    those tests on the nacelles.<br>
    Since you've already put in some<br>
    work on the technique... I thought<br>
    you might like to give me a hand.</p>
  <p> Taurik looks as pleased as a Vulcan can.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    I would be pleased to, sir.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Great. Let's go.</p>
  <p> Geordi waves goodnight to the others, then he and<br>
    Taurik turn and EXIT.</p>
  <p> Ben and Lavelle look at each other a little sheepishly<br>
    as they realize they misjudged Taurik's situation with<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    How about some blackjack?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    I've got to get some sleep so I<br>
    can be sharp tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Lavelle starts to clean up.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Why? So you can get promoted,<br>
    have more responsibility, and have<br>
    to get to sleep even earlier?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Good night...</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>39 INT. SHIP'S GYMNASIUM</p>
  <p> Sito and a few N.D's (possibly Lavelle or Taurik) are<br>
    filing out the door after a martial arts class led by<br>
    Worf -- all are in gis.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ensign Sito --</p>
  <p> She stops, turns.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I also teach an advanced class --<br>
    I believe you may be ready to<br>
    participate.</p>
  <p> Sito allows herself only a brief smile before she looks<br>
    down, embarrassed by his compliment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Before you can join the group,<br>
    however, you must pass the...<br>
    gik'tal.</p>
  <p> Sito reacts --</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Gik'tal?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a very ancient Klingon<br>
    ritual. It tests your knowledge<br>
    of the forms of the mok'bara.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I should practice first...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. No practice. That is part of<br>
    the ritual -- the test must be...<br>
    unannounced.</p>
  <p> Sito is a little nervous about the suddenness of it,<br>
    but she manages a nod.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/19/93 - ACT FOUR 42A.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> They move to the center of the room. To her surprise,<br>
    Worf takes a SCARF and wraps it around her head,<br>
    effectively covering her eyes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can you see?</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Sito is a little taken aback by this, but doesn't<br>
    protest.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Ow!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You did not anticipate.</p>
  <p> In a flash of temper she leaps to her feet and rips the<br>
    scarf off her head.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    How am I supposed to defend myself<br>
    when I can't see a thing?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Stop making excuses! Replace the<br>
    blindfold.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    No, this isn't a fair test.</p>
  <p> Worf holds her gaze for a moment, then a smile traces<br>
    itself on his features.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Very good, Ensign. You have<br>
    passed the challenge.</p>
  <p> It takes her a moment to realize what he's saying.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    What? By taking off the<br>
    blindfold?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It takes courage to say the test<br>
    is not fair.</p>
  <p> Sito is gratified to have succeeded, but puzzled by<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    There's one thing I don't<br>
    understand. Doesn't gik'tal mean<br>
    &quot;to the death&quot;?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You... speak Klingon?</p>
  <p> Worf's alarmed reaction makes her wonder...</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Sir... is there really such a<br>
    thing as the gik'tal challenge?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't like having to admit it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... there is not.</p>
  <p> She looks at him, trying to understand why he did it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But perhaps the next time you are<br>
    judged unfairly, you will not have<br>
    to suffer so many bruises before<br>
    you protest.</p>
  <p> Sito smiles, grateful for what he's trying to do for<br>
    her... Off this moment between them...</p>
  <p>40 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> where Sito, now in uniform, is standing before Picard.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    -- all I've ever wanted is to make<br>
    a career for myself in Starfleet.<br>
    I can't change what happened at<br>
    the Academy. No one can. All I<br>
    can do is work hard and try to<br>
    earn the respect of the people I<br>
    serve with.</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, steadies herself.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If you're not going to give me<br>
    that chance, then I respectfully<br>
    request that you transfer me to<br>
    another ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you're looking for a more<br>
    lenient commander, I don't think<br>
    you'll find one.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Permission to speak freely, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please do.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    If you didn't want me on your ship<br>
    you should have said so when I was<br>
    assigned to it.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SITO (Cont'd)<br>
    It's not your place to punish me<br>
    for what I did at the Academy.</p>
  <p> Picard studies her carefully as she addresses him.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've worked hard here. My record<br>
    is exemplary. If you're going to<br>
    judge me, judge me for what I am<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, moves around his desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right, Ensign. I will...</p>
  <p> Sito prepares herself for the worst.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It took a lot of courage to come<br>
    here and face me after what I said<br>
    to you the other day.</p>
  <p> He sees the look of confusion on her face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You see... I didn't call you in<br>
    here then to assess your<br>
    qualifications for the Ops<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I... don't understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was harsh with you because I was<br>
    assessing you for a very important<br>
    mission. A mission that could<br>
    involve a situation far more...<br>
    unnerving than being dressed down<br>
    by your commanding officer.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    May I ask what this mission --</p>
  <p> He holds up a hand to stop her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/23/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Join the senior staff in the<br>
    Observation Lounge at oh-nine<br>
    hundred hours. We'll discuss it<br>
    then.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> She turns to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Ensign... I do know how you<br>
    ended up on the Enterprise. I<br>
    asked for you.</p>
  <p> This clearly surprises her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I wanted to make sure you got a<br>
    fair chance to redeem yourself.</p>
  <p> She acknowledges, grateful -- then EXITS. Off Picard's<br>
    face...</p>
  <p>41 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> where Beverly is working. Ogawa approaches her.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    You wanted to see me, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles at Ogawa, feeling uncomfortable about<br>
    this but sure she must proceed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Alyssa, I think you know how much<br>
    I've come to depend on you. I've<br>
    recommended your promotion because<br>
    your performance here has been<br>
    exemplary.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Thank you, Doctor... I appreciate<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> She looks at Beverly, wondering what's going on.<br>
    Clearly this is about more than her performance.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/29/93 - ACT FOUR 47A.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But more than that, I've come to<br>
    think of you as a friend. Someone<br>
    I care about...</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    That's nice of you to say. I feel<br>
    the same way.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So... I was wondering about you<br>
    and Andrew Powell...</p>
  <p> Ogawa's face lights up.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Someone told you!</p>
  <p> Now it's Beverly's turn to look puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Told me... ?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    We were going to keep it a secret<br>
    until the promotions are<br>
    announced.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Secret... ?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    He asked me to marry him.</p>
  <p> Beverly is completely taken aback.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Alyssa -- that's wonderful!</p>

  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm so relieved...</p>
  <p> Ogawa gives her a slight look --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I mean -- happy.</p>
  <p> They hug... OFF this moment...</p>
  <p>42 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p>43 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> as Sito ENTERS. Riker and Worf look up and gesture<br>
    that she should take a seat. Someone else is seated in<br>
    the chair facing away from her, but she can't see them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have a seat, Ensign.</p>
  <p> Worf gives her a reassuring look. She moves inside,<br>
    takes a chair. She glances over and sees that the<br>
    unseen person in the chair is a Cardassian -- the same<br>
    one Ogawa saw in Sickbay. As a Bajoran she can't help<br>
    but react -- though she quickly recovers.</p>
  <p> The DOOR OPENS -- Picard ENTERS and takes a seat.<br>
    Picard gestures to the Cardassian.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Joret Dal... he was in the<br>
    escape pod we retrieved.</p>
  <p> Joret nods a greeting to Sito.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Joret is a member of the<br>
    Cardassian military... he is also<br>
    a Federation operative.</p>
  <p> Picard lets this sink in for a beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He risked his life to come here<br>
    and give us invaluable information<br>
    about Cardassia's strategic<br>
    intentions -- information that<br>
    could very well enhance the<br>
    security of Bajor, as well as<br>
    other planets in this sector. It<br>
    is imperative that we get him<br>
    safely back to Cardassian space.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    It will not be easy. The border<br>
    is heavily guarded.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Since his ship was destroyed he's<br>
    going to have to take one of our<br>
    shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    If a patrol stops me, I will claim<br>
    to have stolen it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have distressed the shuttle so<br>
    that it appears to have been fired<br>
    on.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Joret's going to have to try and<br>
    talk his way past the patrol.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    If I were alone, the chances of my<br>
    succeeding would be slim. But if<br>
    I had a prisoner with me... a<br>
    Bajoran terrorist...</p>
  <p> Worf glances at Sito as she realizes what the plan<br>
    entails -- she is listening without betraying any<br>
    emotion.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FOUR 49A.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    I would appear to be a bounty<br>
    hunter. Border crossings of that<br>
    nature are not uncommon... for a<br>
    price, the patrol can be convinced<br>
    to look the other way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Sito.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once the shuttle is safely past<br>
    the patrol, Joret will put you in<br>
    an escape pod and send you back<br>
    across the border.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Since the pod is so small, it<br>
    shouldn't be detectable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll be waiting here to pick you<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I understand, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is obviously a very dangerous<br>
    mission. I'm not ordering you to<br>
    take part in it.</p>
  <p> She looks up at him.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Then I'll volunteer, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Be certain you understand the risk<br>
    you are taking. If you are<br>
    captured --</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I'm Bajoran. No one knows better<br>
    than I do what the Cardassians do<br>
    to their prisoners.</p>
  <p> She turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've made my decision.</p>
  <p> Picard studies her for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, Ensign. Report to<br>
    Sickbay.<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    Doctor Crusher will explain.</p>
  <p> She stands.</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'd also ask you not to discuss<br>
    this mission with anyone...</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> She EXITS. There is a silent moment as everyone<br>
    contemplates the dangers of what she's being asked to<br>
    do. Joret turns to Picard, gives voice to what they're<br>
    all thinking.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    (continuing, quiet)<br>
    I didn't realize she would be<br>
    so... young...</p>

    shuttle. Joret is at the controls; Worf stands near<br>
    the aft section. Sito ENTERS from the corridor,<br>
    dressed in BAJORAN CIVILIAN CLOTHES. When she<br>
    approaches Worf we see that her face is badly BRUISED.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    The Captain asked Doctor Crusher<br>
    to make it look like Joret had<br>
    mistreated me...</p>
  <p> Geordi steps out of the back of the shuttle.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're all set...</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges and Geordi moves off.</p>

  <p> SITO<br>
    Sir... I want you to know that I<br>
    really appreciate the fact that<br>
    you've always had confidence in<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges -- he's proud of her, but at the same<br>
    time concerned for her well-being.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good luck...</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    I'll see you soon...</p>
  <p> She steps up into the shuttle and the door begins to<br>

    apprehensive.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    We are approaching the border...<br>
    it won't be long before we're<br>
    detected by the patrol ships.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    When they stop us... do you want<br>
    me to say anything?</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    No. It should seem that I've<br>
    broken your will. If you're asked<br>
    any questions, look at me... as<br>
    though you're afraid to answer.</p>
  <p> She nods grimly. After a moment, she turns to him.</p>
  <p> SITO<br>
    Can I ask you something... ? Why<br>
    are you doing this -- risking your<br>
    life to help Starfleet?</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    I don't consider myself a traitor,<br>
    if that's what you're asking.</p>
  <p> It is clear from his tone that Joret has thought about<br>
    this a great deal.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've served in the military all my<br>
    life... once it was an institution<br>
    dedicated to the security of<br>
    Cardassia, now it's little more<br>
    than... a platform for ambitious<br>
    Guls hoping to make their<br>
    reputations in battle.</p>
  <p> Sito hears the conviction in his voice.</p>

  <p> JORET<br>

    If the information I provide helps<br>
    Starfleet deter even one pointless<br>
    border skirmish, I'll have served<br>
    my purpose. I'm sick of war. My<br>
    people need peace.</p>
  <p> Sito is struck by what he's told her... after a<br>

    Cardassian say something like<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> He turns and regards her for a beat.</p>
  <p> JORET<br>
    And I never thought a Bajoran<br>
    would risk her life to help a<br>
    Cardassian get home...</p>
  <p> This moment between them is interrupted by a warning<br>
    BEEP from the cockpit console.</p>

    A patrol ship is closing in on our<br>

  <p> He stands and picks up a SHACKLE (as seen in &quot;Chain of<br>

  <p>52 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> where Taurik, Lavelle and Ogawa are in midconversation.<br>
    Ben stands nearby.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    She must have left on that<br>
    shuttle, there's no other<br>
    explanation.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Do you have any idea where it<br>
    went?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Toward Cardassian space -- that's<br>
    what I'm worried about.</p>
  <p> In the face of Lavelle's concern, Ogawa and Taurik are<br>
    finding it very difficult to keep silent about what<br>
    they know -- but they both feel they have to.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's another thing, I noticed<br>
    the shuttle was damaged --</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Sam, can we talk about something<br>
    else?</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Don't you care what's happened to<br>
    her?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Of course --</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    But we have to accept the fact<br>
    that we're not always told about<br>
    everything that happens aboard<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    We can at least tell each other<br>
    what we know.</p>
  <p> Lavelle sees a slight reaction in both Ogawa and<br>
    Taurik.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do you two know something?</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Sam, please...</p>

  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    I can't believe this. We're<br>
    friends.</p>

  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    We're also Starfleet Officers.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    I'm not allowed to talk about<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> Lavelle stops short when he realizes it's a security<br>
    matter. He looks from Ogawa to Taurik -- then<br>
    acknowledges their situation.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Okay... I understand.</p>
  <p> Still, he's immensely frustrated... An awkward silence<br>
    settles over the group...</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I better get going... I'm on duty<br>
    in half an hour...</p>
  <p> He stands and EXITS, leaving the others sitting<br>
    quitely...</p>

  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p>54 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is in the Command Area, Worf at Tactical, Data at<br>
    Ops, Lavelle at the Conn. The mood is grim.</p>
  <p> Riker crosses down to a point between Ops and Conn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    We've completed a long-range scan<br>
    of the area, sir. The escape pod<br>
    doesn't seem to be out there.</p>
  <p> Riker lets out a frustrated breath.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is possible that at this<br>
    distance we are simply unable to<br>
    distinguish the pod from the<br>
    inorganic matter normally present<br>
    in space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Try narrowing the scan field --<br>
    see if you can pick up any biosigns.</p>
  <p> Data sets to work and Riker starts to turn away, but<br>
    Lavelle stops him with a question.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Sir... it would help if I knew<br>
    what kind of life-signs to look<br>
    for.</p>
  <p> Riker considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're scanning for Bajoran lifesigns,<br>
    Ensign.</p>
  <p> Lavelle reacts -- this is the first confirmation he's<br>
    had that he's looking for his friend.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker realizes what he's probably going through, and he<br>
    puts a hand to Lavelle's shoulder before crossing back<br>
    to the Command Area.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room and approaches Riker<br>
    for a report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing yet, sir. The pod's<br>
    thirty-two hours overdue.</p>
  <p> Worf looks up from his console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; 11/17/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I recommend we launch a probe<br>
    to increase the range of our<br>
    sensor sweeps.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat. Riker doesn't like to<br>
    have to be the one to say it:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Sending a probe into Cardassian<br>
    space would be a treaty violation.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, but he's still considering it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Prepare a probe and launch when<br>
    ready.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf sets to work, grasping this last thread of hope.<br>
    After a beat we hear the SOUND of a probe being<br>
    launched.</p>
  <p>55 ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Stock shot of a probe being fired away.</p>
  <p>56 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as they watch the probe disappear.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will be several minutes before<br>
    we begin to receive the probe's<br>
    telemetry.</p>
  <p> Picard settles into his seat to wait.</p>

  <p>56A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is pacing anxiously.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir... I am detecting signs of<br>
    debris two hundred thousand<br>
    kilometers inside Cardassian<br>
    space...</p>
  <p> Lavelle turns to Data, his face full of dread.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing, off<br>

    Its mass and composition indicate<br>
    that it could be the remains of a<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Has been lost in the line of<br>

  <p> Ogawa covers her face with her hand; Beverly puts a<br>
    comforting hand to her shoulder.</p>

  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    She was the finest example of a<br>
    Starfleet officer... a young woman<br>
    of remarkable courage... and<br>
    strength of character.</p>
  <p>60A INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Her absense will be deeply felt by<br>
    all who knew her...</p>

    announcement.</p>

  <p> as it moves at impulse.</p>
  <p>63 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Worf sits alone at a table near the windows. Ben<br>
    approaches him with a drink. Sensing that he's lost in<br>
    thought, he sets it down as unobtrusively as possible<br>
    and moves off...</p>
  <p> We FOLLOW him as he approaches Ogawa and Taurik, who<br>
    are sitting in silence at their usual table (there are<br>
    two empty chairs). Their mood is somber. Ben puts a<br>
    comforting hand to Ogawa's shoulder.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    You okay... ?</p>
  <p> She manages a small nod... They see Lavelle ENTER and<br>
    approach their table.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    Hi...</p>
  <p> Lavelle sits; he seems troubled.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I just got promoted...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Lavelle shows them the COLLAR PIP he's been given to<br>
    designate his new rank. It is clear that he has<br>
    conflicting feelings about this. Ogawa tries to put<br>
    the best face on it:</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Congratulations...</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    (without enthusiasm)<br>
    Thanks...</p>
  <p> They all know what he must be going through.</p>
  <p> LAVELLE<br>
    I just don't feel right about<br>
    it... for all I know, she was<br>
    going to get the promotion instead<br>
    of me.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    You shouldn't feel that way, Sam.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    She would have been happy for you.</p>
  <p> TAURIK<br>
    The best way to remember her...<br>
    would be to excel in your new<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Ogawa takes the pip from Lavelle's hand; as she pins it<br>
    to his collar.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    We're proud of you, Sam.</p>
  <p> Lavelle looks at his friend's faces, grateful for their<br>
    support.</p>
  <p> Ben moves off, and we FOLLOW him as he crosses to<br>
    Worf's table.</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Excuse me, sir... but I need to<br>
    move this table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lower Decks&quot; REV. 11/18/93 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    There's an empty seat over there.</p>
  <p> Ben indicates the table where Sito's friends are<br>
    sitting. Worf realizes what he's up to.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I appreciate what you are trying<br>
    to do, but it is not...<br>
    appropriate. You were her<br>
    friends. I was only her<br>
    commanding officer...</p>
  <p> BEN<br>
    Sir... I happen to know that she<br>
    considered you a friend.</p>
  <p> Worf looks up at him. He considers, then stands. He<br>
    and Ben cross over to the table. The others look up at<br>
    him, their faces welcoming... and then Worf takes his<br>
    seat among Sito's friends... Off this moment...</p>
