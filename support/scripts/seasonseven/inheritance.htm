  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit around the planet Atrea.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47410.2.<br>
    The Atrean government has<br>
    requested assistance in averting<br>
    a natural disaster that is<br>
    threatening their world. Two of<br>
    their geologists have come aboard<br>
    to discuss the problem, one of<br>
    whom is a human who has been<br>
    living on Atrea Four.</p>
  <p>2 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, GEORDI, and DATA look on as Atrean Scientist<br>
    PRAN TAINER stands before an OKUDAGRAM depicting a<br>
    cross-section of the Atrean planet. Also present is<br>
    Pran's human wife, JULIANA TAINER, a fiftyish woman<br>
    dressed in Atrean fashion. The Atreans are a humanoid<br>
    species, only slightly different from us.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Captain, our situation has<br>
    worsened since my husband and I<br>
    first contacted you. The molten<br>
    core of our planet is not just<br>
    cooling -- it's begun to solidify.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    Our gravitational field has been<br>
    affected -- seismic activity has<br>
    increased by a factor of three.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    If the cooling continues at this<br>
    rate -- Atrea will become<br>
    uninhabitable within thirteen<br>
    months.</p>
  <p> Everyone takes in this grim news.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could minimize seismic activity<br>
    by creating isobaric fissures and<br>
    releasing some of the tectonic<br>
    stress -- but that would just be<br>
    a temporary fix.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The only permanent solution would<br>
    be to re-liquefy the core.</p>
  <p> Geordi stands and moves to the Okudagram.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    These pockets in the magma layer --<br>
    how close are they to the molten<br>
    region of the core?</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    A few kilometers, why?</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You think that's close enough to<br>
    try ferro-plasmic infusion?</p>
  <p> Data considers, then acknowledges the possibility.<br>
    Juliana and Pran share a look -- they're not sure what<br>
    this means.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data moves toward the monitor, gesturing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The procedure would involve using<br>
    our ship's phasers to drill down<br>
    through the planet's surface and<br>
    into the pockets -- where we would<br>
    set up a series of plasma infusion<br>
    units.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd trigger the units by firing<br>
    a modulated energy burst down<br>
    through the shafts.</p>
  <p> Juliana addresses Data.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I see... injecting sufficient<br>
    plasma directly into the core<br>
    should trigger a chain reaction...<br>
    and that will reliquify the<br>
    magma...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It should be possible to stabilize<br>
    the core temperature at ninety-three<br>
    percent of normal.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    If it works, the core would remain<br>
    molten for centuries.</p>
  <p> Picard lets Pran and Juliana consider for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you give your permission, we'll<br>
    begin immediately.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    Very well. But before we proceed,<br>
    I'd like to update our geological<br>
    surveys.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll be glad to help you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Pran and Juliana)<br>
    I've assigned you quarters during<br>
    the time we're here. Please make<br>
    yourselves comfortable.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> The meeting breaks up and Picard, Pran, and Geordi<br>
    EXIT. Data starts to follow, but Juliana stops him.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Data --</p>
  <p> Data turns to her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Doctor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> She has an almost expectant look on her face -- a kind<br>
    of breathless anticipation.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Do you have any idea who I am?</p>
  <p> Data is puzzled by the question.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are Doctor Juliana Tainer.</p>
  <p> Juliana exhales slightly, as though a question of long<br>
    standing had finally been resolved.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    You lost all your early memories.<br>
    We thought you would -- but we<br>
    couldn't know for certain.</p>
  <p> Data is now even more puzzled. He looks at her<br>
    quizzically.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have we met before?</p>
  <p> She looks at him with what can only be called pride,<br>
    eyes shining.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Oh, Data, I was there -- right<br>
    from the beginning, on Omicron<br>
    Theta. I helped create you.<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    And now... look at you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (taken aback)<br>
    You were a colleague of Doctor<br>
    Soong?</p>
  <p> She laughs, a warm, merry laugh that lights her face.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Yes, I certainly was -- and I was<br>
    also his wife. In a way, I<br>
    suppose you could say -- I'm your<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> Off Data's reaction to this unexpected revelation...</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>3 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Data and Juliana at a table. Her eyes are shining as<br>
    she looks at him...</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I still can't believe it... seeing<br>
    you again after all these years...</p>
  <p> Data is curious about the situation, but of course not<br>
    sharing Juliana's emotional response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, I have no memory of you.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    There's a reason for that... we<br>
    wiped your processors after we'd<br>
    finished refining your<br>
    programming.</p>
  <p> She leans forward, looks at him lovingly.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Why don't you tell me what you do<br>
    remember... and then I'll fill in<br>
    the gaps.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (pondering)<br>
    My memory record begins when I was<br>
    activated by the Starfleet<br>
    officers who found me on the<br>
    Omicron Theta outpost.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    After the attack by the<br>
    Crystalline Entity --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. All of the inhabitants of<br>
    the colony had been killed.</p>
  <p> Juliana acknowledges somberly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But -- I discovered that my memory<br>
    banks contained the contents of<br>
    their journals and logs.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (a gentle smile)<br>
    We thought you might find their<br>
    experiences useful... after your<br>
    childhood, we figured you needed<br>
    all the help you could get.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My -- childhood?</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    That's what I called it. You were<br>
    like a baby at first -- a hundred<br>
    kilogram baby, but still...</p>
  <p> She shakes her head, smiling at the recollection.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It took you a while to develop<br>
    motor skills... learn how to<br>
    process sensory information. And<br>
    of course Noonian was never<br>
    satisfied... he kept tinkering,<br>
    trying to make you as human as<br>
    possible. And then there was the<br>
    business about hiccuping...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hiccuping?</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    He was determined that you'd have<br>
    periodic bouts of hiccups, but he<br>
    couldn't get it right -- they were<br>
    either too violent, or too<br>
    prolonged, or not noticeable at<br>
    all... I finally said, good<br>
    heavens, Noonian -- nobody likes<br>
    having hiccups. Why don't you<br>
    just forget it? So he did.</p>
  <p> She smiles again, enjoying these reveries. But Data is<br>
    still interested in getting information.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    So you wiped my memory processors<br>
    after this -- childhood.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Then we deactivated you -- and<br>
    programmed you with the colonists'<br>
    logs. We were planning to reactivate<br>
    you.<br>
    (beat, more somber)<br>
    But we never had the chance. The<br>
    Crystalline Entity attacked... we<br>
    had to leave quickly. We wanted<br>
    to bring you with us -- but there<br>
    was only room for two in the<br>
    escape pod.</p>
  <p> There is a beat as Data considers this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, I have scanned the<br>
    colonists' journals... there is<br>
    only one Juliana mentioned in<br>
    them, and her last name is<br>
    O'Donnell.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    That's me...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But there is no mention that my<br>
    father was married to you.</p>
  <p> She shakes her head, again smiling at a recollection.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Because of my mother.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    She thought Noonian was an<br>
    eccentric scientist who was too<br>
    old for me... we decided to get<br>
    married secretly and give her some<br>
    time to get used to the idea of<br>
    our being together.</p>
  <p> She leans forward, conspiratorially.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We slipped away to Mavala Four and<br>
    got married there... a Klingon and<br>
    a Corvallan trader were our<br>
    witnesses...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JULIANA (Cont'd)<br>
    (a bit wistful)<br>
    It wasn't exactly the wedding I'd<br>
    hoped for, but Noonian had a way<br>
    of making the oddest things seem<br>
    romantic...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My father did have an unusual way<br>
    of looking at things...</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    How would you know that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I encountered him once -- in the<br>
    Terlina system.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (excited)<br>
    That's where we went -- after we<br>
    left the outpost... I had no idea<br>
    you'd ever met him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was shortly before his death.</p>
  <p> There is a shocked pause.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    He's... dead?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Juliana seems to shrink into herself for a moment,<br>
    grappling with this unexpected news.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I didn't think it would hit me<br>
    this hard...<br>
    (beat, struggling for<br>
    control)<br>
    We didn't exactly part on the best<br>
    of terms...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I realized that he loved his work<br>
    as much as he loved me. Maybe<br>
    more. There we were, stuck on<br>
    that planet in the middle of a<br>
    jungle... no one else to talk to,<br>
    no -- no life. It just wasn't<br>
    enough...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's why I left.</p>
  <p> This was clearly a difficult decision for her. After<br>
    a moment she looks up at him, reassuring, smiling her<br>
    lovely smile.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Anyway, it was a long time ago.<br>
    What's important is that we're<br>
    together now.</p>
  <p> She touches his arm.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I want to get to know you.</p>
  <p> But Data hesitates. This has been a lot to assimilate<br>
    in one sitting, and he isn't sure how to respond.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT ONE 8B.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This has been an interesting<br>
    encounter, and one altogether<br>
    unexpected. I would like to<br>
    corroborate what you have told me<br>
    before we proceed further.</p>
  <p> Juliana stares at him... his lack of emotion is hard<br>
    for her to accept. She clearly hoped for a more<br>
    positive response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Off her face as he EXITS...</p>

  <p> as it orbits Atrea.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi is working at the pool table, Data is working at<br>
    a separate monitor along the side wall.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm just about finished<br>
    reconfiguring the phaser banks.<br>
    We should be ready to start<br>
    drilling in about an hour.</p>
  <p> Data doesn't look up from his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Inform me when you are ready.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves closer to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What are you doing there, anyway?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am attempting to ascertain<br>
    whether Doctor Tainer's story is<br>
    true.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't you believe her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I neither doubt nor believe her.<br>
    I am simply attempting to verify<br>
    her assertions.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles to himself at this android response.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, what have you turned up so<br>
    far?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Registrar's Office on Mavala<br>
    Four cannot confirm that Doctor<br>
    Soong was married there.<br>

  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    Apparently many documents were<br>
    lost when the government was<br>
    overthrown.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at Data's console, which is scrolling<br>
    RAPIDLY.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then what are you looking at?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am checking passenger manifests<br>
    to see if they went to Mavala<br>
    during the period in question.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Data reaches out and stops the scroll.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    O'Donnell, Juliana...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Soong, Noonian -- they were both<br>
    passengers on a transport that<br>
    travelled from Omicron Theta to<br>
    Mavala... and returned four days<br>
    later.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That sure seems to fit her story.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Still, the fact that they went to<br>
    Mavala does not prove they were<br>
    married there.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know, Data... I almost get the<br>
    feeling you're trying to prove<br>
    that Doctor Tainer wasn't telling<br>
    the truth.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at all. I am merely unable to<br>
    reconcile her story with the fact<br>
    that my father never mentioned her<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, she did leave him. Maybe<br>
    she broke his heart. Maybe he<br>
    just didn't want to talk about<br>
    her...</p>
  <p> Data's brow furrows as he tries to comprehend this kind<br>
    of emotional response.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And let me ask you this... Doctor<br>
    Soong created an emotion chip for<br>
    you... didn't Lore tell you it<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is possible that those are the<br>
    memories of my childhood. And of<br>
    my mother.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And if you think about it -- why<br>
    would she lie? Why would someone<br>
    pretend to be your mother?</p>
  <p> Data considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can think of no motive for such<br>
    a pretense.</p>
  <p> Geordi assesses his friend's situation, tries to help<br>
    him understand it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can understand why you might be<br>
    a little disconcerted by all<br>
    this... it came out of the<br>
    blue... and the story doesn't fit<br>
    neatly into your logical<br>
    processors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But that's life, Data. Part of<br>
    being human is learning to handle<br>
    the unexpected... to risk new<br>
    experiences even when they don't<br>
    fit your preconceptions.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will admit that it is difficult<br>
    for me to accept the possibility<br>
    of a past about which I know<br>
    nothing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But it is also true that I am very<br>
    curious to learn more about it.</p>
  <p> Geordi grins at him. Off the new sense of possibility<br>

  <p> JULIANA<br>
    -- I wanted to make you female,<br>
    but your father insisted on a son.<br>
    We argued about it endlessly,<br>
    right up until we were ready to<br>
    assemble you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (intrigued)<br>
    How did you decide?</p>
  <p> She smiles as she remembers.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Well, Noonian walked in holding<br>
    your head in his hand and --<br>
    innocent as you please -- said it<br>
    was up to me. Of course he knew<br>
    perfectly well what he was<br>
    doing... once again, he'd made it<br>
    in his own image -- what was I to<br>
    say?</p>
  <p> Data stops when they reach a DOOR. Juliana glances at<br>
    the nameplate on the door.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>

    Deanna Troi... is this who you're<br>
    going to visit?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She can't keep a small smile from coming to her lips.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Your father would be so pleased.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Pleased?</p>

  <p> as Troi takes a CUP OF TEA from the Replicator. She<br>
    crosses toward the couch with it and we see that Data<br>
    is sitting there. She takes a seat near him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Tainer has provided me with<br>
    many details about my development<br>
    that I was not aware of.<br>
    Conversing with her was a<br>
    fascinating experience --</p>
  <p> Troi detects a qualifying note in his voice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Her interest in me seems to be...<br>
    limitless.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles knowingly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She's your mother, Data. That's<br>
    how parents are.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was a parent. I do not recall<br>
    exhibiting excessive interest in<br>
    Lal's behavior.</p>

  <p> Troi fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, you and Lal were practically<br>
    inseparable the entire time she<br>
    was alive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, but... she needed my help.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That's how every parent feels.<br>
    It's very hard to let your<br>
    children go out into the world and<br>
    fend for themselves. You can't<br>
    help but be protective of them.<br>
    I'm sure your mother feels the<br>
    same way.</p>
  <p> Data seems curious about that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If that is true... then why did<br>
    she never attempt to contact me?</p>
  <p> Troi is struck by his question...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know, Data. It could have<br>
    something to do with your parents'<br>
    separating... you were part of a<br>
    life she might have wanted to put<br>
    behind her.</p>
  <p> She sees that the question seems to bother him.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    We will be in position over the<br>

    twenty-nine seconds.</p>
  <p> She moves to look at the OKUDAGRAM displayed on his<br>
    console (a modified version of the one seen earlier),<br>
    and when she leans in she puts a hand to his shoulder --<br>
    now that he's accepted her she obviously feels<br>
    comfortable with him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These scans indicate that the<br>
    magma pockets where we plan to set<br>
    up the infusion units are somewhat<br>
    unstable.</p>
  <p> She acknowledges and sits near him.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I'm going to monitor the density<br>
    of the rock layers and adjust the<br>
    strength of the particle beam as<br>
    we go. That should minimize the<br>
    seismic stress we generate while<br>
    we're drilling.</p>
  <p> Geordi approaches from another part of Engineering.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I've configured the phasers to<br>
    create the most highly focused<br>
    particle beam possible.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Geordi.</p>
  <p> Juliana smiles to herself, which catches Data's<br>
    attention.</p>

  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (explaining)<br>
    I'm just glad to see that you have<br>
    good manners. It wasn't easy to<br>
    strike the right balance in your<br>
    programming.</p>
  <p> Data is clearly interested in hearing more, so she<br>
    continues.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At first you couldn't have cared<br>
    less about social niceties like<br>
    &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;; you<br>
    were... downright rude, in fact.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data? That's hard to picture --</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But the first time we modified<br>
    your program we overcompensated;<br>
    it made you so obsequious your<br>
    Father couldn't stand to be in the<br>
    same room with you.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't help but laugh; Data is clearly intrigued.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That was nothing compared to the<br>
    problems we had --<br>
    (stops herself)<br>
    Never mind. I don't want to<br>
    embarrass you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am incapable of embarrassment.<br>
    Please, continue.</p>
  <p> Juliana shrugs a &quot;if you say so.&quot;</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    One thing we didn't anticipate was<br>
    that you thought nothing of being<br>
    naked.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    -- some of the colonists objected<br>
    to having an anatomically-correct<br>
    android running around without any<br>
    clothes on.</p>

  <p> Geordi and Juliana share a smile over the image she's<br>
    just conjured.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We asked you to dress, but you<br>
    felt it was unnecessary since you<br>
    didn't need protection from the<br>
    elements. We actually had to<br>
    write a modesty sub-routine to get<br>
    you to keep your clothes on.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, but I'm sure Data knows what<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you. I have been practicing<br>
    for a recital tomorrow evening.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    That was beautiful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been told that my playing<br>
    is technically flawless, but it<br>
    has never been described as<br>
    beautiful.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Well it was... really.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you certain that you are not<br>
    saying that because you are my<br>
    Mother?<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    I have observed that parents tend<br>
    to exaggerate when it comes to<br>
    their children's accomplishments.</p>
  <p> Juliana smiles at his observation.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I suppose there is a certain<br>
    amount of vanity involved...<br>
    considering that giving you a<br>
    creative capacity was my idea.</p>
  <p> She sees that Data doesn't know what she means.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Your Father didn't really see the<br>
    point... he thought that since you<br>
    didn't have emotions, you would<br>
    have no need to express yourself.<br>
    (a pensive beat)<br>
    Somehow... I had the feeling the<br>
    opposite would be true.</p>
  <p> Data is struck by what she's told him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know for certain... but<br>
    I believe that it is during my<br>

    Well... I'm glad I insisted.</p>

    As am I.</p>
  <p> A moment between them -- then Data starts to put his<br>

    How would you feel about my<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I would like that very much.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    We should practice -- do you<br>
    happen to have a viola?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can replicate one for you.</p>
  <p> Data heads to a corner; Juliana moves toward a stack of<br>
    PAINTINGS that lean against the wall.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Did you paint these?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND of the replicator, and Data crosses<br>
    with a viola toward Juliana, who is looking at the<br>
    first painting in the stack, a Picasso-esque rendering<br>
    of Spot.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am attempting to master all<br>

  <p> He pulls a painting of a pastoral scene from the stack.</p>

  <p> Juliana turns and looks at him -- surprised.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Your daughter... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. I created her... using<br>
    myself as a model.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Where is she now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The positronic matrix I designed<br>
    for her was unstable. She only<br>
    lived a short time.</p>
  <p> Juliana takes this in.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In a sense, you were her<br>
    grandmother...</p>
  <p> Juliana doesn't answer, just stares down at the<br>

    her.</p>

  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data... can I ask you something?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Do you think you'll ever try to<br>
    create an android again?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps. I created Lal because I<br>
    wished to procreate. Despite what<br>
    happened to her, I still have that<br>
    wish.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    But... how do you know the same<br>
    thing won't happen? Creating a<br>
    stable positronic matrix is very<br>
    tricky -- your Father lost several<br>
    prototypes before Lore.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to this information.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was not aware that he created<br>
    any androids before my brother.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    There were three of them... they<br>
    were like children to us... losing<br>
    them was very painful. When<br>
    Noonian decided to try again, I<br>
    was very much against it. I<br>
    didn't think we had the right to<br>
    bring a life into the world that<br>
    had so little chance of surviving.</p>
  <p> These are clearly painful memories for her. After a<br>
    moment:</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But your Father was sure he'd<br>
    figured out what went wrong,<br>
    insisted he could make a stable<br>
    matrix. And he did.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But Lore was cruel... evil.<br>
    Eventually, we had no choice... we<br>
    had to dismantle him.</p>

  <p> This is clearly an awful memory.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Your father decided to build yet<br>
    another android, one who didn't<br>
    have emotions -- I couldn't<br>
    believe he was going to try again.<br>
    After everything that'd<br>
    happened...</p>
  <p> Data reacts to what she's said.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mother... I am that android. Are<br>
    you saying that you were against<br>
    my creation?</p>
  <p> She realizes that she's inadvertently said just that.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Initially I was. But I was wrong;<br>
    I know that now.</p>
  <p> She is afraid she's &quot;hurt&quot; him. She takes his hand,<br>
    hoping to reassure him.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've followed your progress for<br>
    years -- I'm very proud of what<br>
    you've accomplished.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then... why did you never attempt<br>
    to contact me?</p>
  <p> She looks at him for a moment, as if weighing something<br>
    in her mind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Because... I was ashamed... of<br>
    something I'd done...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> She lets out a breath, decides to continue.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I never wanted you to know this...<br>
    I've felt guilty about it for<br>
    years...</p>
  <p> She looks up at him with a small, empty laugh.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    That's something you don't have to<br>
    worry about, do you? Guilt --<br>
    eating away at you...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps if you told me what has<br>
    made you feel that way, your guilt<br>
    might be alleviated.</p>
  <p> She takes a breath, steels herself.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I lied when I said there wasn't<br>
    room for you in the escape pod<br>
    that we took from Omicron... there<br>
    was...</p>
  <p> Tears wet her eyes; she takes a breath before<br>
    continuing.</p>

    I didn't want to bring you with<br>
    us... I was afraid that if we reactivated<br>
    you, you'd turn out like<br>
    Lore.</p>
  <p> She can't look at him as she makes this admission. Her<br>
    voice is full of regret.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I made Noonian leave you behind...</p>
  <p> Her secret is finally out -- overcome with emotion, and<br>
    unsure how Data will react, she stands and EXITS. Off<br>
    Data's face as he watches her go...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data and Juliana are in the process of drilling the<br>
    second shaft; Geordi works nearby -- the DISTINCTIVE<br>
    SOUND that indicates the modified phasers are in use<br>
    can be heard.</p>
  <p> Juliana keeps her focus on the console in front of her,<br>
    avoiding eye contact with Data -- she's clearly<br>
    uncomfortable in his presence now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We are within four kilometers of<br>
    the magma pocket...</p>
  <p> Juliana seems lost in thought, doesn't react to Data's<br>
    report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Doctor, should we lower the beam<br>
    intensity?</p>
  <p> She comes back, focuses.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Yes -- yes, by sixteen percent...</p>

  <p>19 RESUME ENGINEERING/BRIDGE INTERCUT</p>
  <p> Suddenly the ship starts to SHUDDER.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We're getting feedback pulses<br>
    along the particle beam --</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    We must have hit a pocket of<br>
    magnesite ore -- I'll try to<br>
    adjust the phaser harmonics to<br>
    compensate.</p>
  <p> She starts working. The SHUDDER intensifies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're going to have to terminate<br>
    the beam if this keeps up --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we do, we will have to begin a<br>
    new shaft at another suitable<br>
    location --</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (as she works)<br>
    There is no other suitable<br>
    location -- give me a few more<br>
    seconds --</p>
  <p> The SHUDDER becomes more severe.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor, it's going to take longer<br>
    than that to match the resonant --</p>
  <p> Suddenly the SHUDDER STOPS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You did it --</p>
  <p> She's all business, keeps working the console.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    It was just luck... I hit the<br>
    right frequency...</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles, glad she pulled it off -- but Data<br>
    regards her with a look that's hard to read.</p>

    Excellent.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander, may I suggest we set up<br>
    the infusion unit in the first<br>
    magma pocket while we give this<br>
    one a chance to cool.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Data, Doctor Tainer -- we'll meet<br>
    you in Transporter Room Two.</p>
  <p> Riker and Pran head for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Data stands and gestures the direction they should go.<br>
    He tries not to show it but something is clearly on his<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p>20 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Atrea.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>21 INT. THE FIRST MAGMA POCKET</p>
  <p> Data and Juliana are calibrating one of the INFUSION<br>
    UNITS -- the device is about the size of a two-drawer<br>
    filing cabinet, has control panels on several faces,<br>
    and should have some sort of receiving node on top that<br>
    looks like it could absorb a phaser blast.</p>
  <p> The only light comes from PRACTICAL SOURCES our people<br>
    have set up previously. The shaft they drilled from<br>
    the surface is suggested by a HOLE about seven feet in<br>
    diameter in the pocket's ceiling.</p>
  <p> Pran is near the cave wall, scanning it with a<br>
    TRICORDER. They work in silence for a few moments --<br>
    the only SOUND is a low-level rumbling, the molten core<br>
    not far beneath their feet. It's hot in here -- Pran<br>
    and Juliana begin to perspire.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have initialized the plasma<br>
    induction coils.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (as she works)<br>
    I'll need another minute to align<br>
    the diverter...</p>
  <p> Data watches her as she works... his expression<br>
    gradually becomes more intent than just a casual<br>
    glance.</p>
  <p>22 ON JULIANA'S FACE</p>
  <p> she appears to be concentrating on her work -- nothing<br>
    seems out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p>23 ON DATA'S FACE</p>
  <p> looking at her intently -- his expression is hard to<br>
    read. Has her revelation to him changed how he views<br>
    her?</p>
  <p>24 CLOSE ON JULIANA'S EYES</p>
  <p> as she looks down at the panel she's working on. (Her<br>
    eyes should blink at least once.)</p>
  <p>25 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Data continues to watch her face -- the moment is<br>
    broken when Pran approaches.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    There are signs of stress in the<br>
    surrounding magma, but the site<br>
    should remain stable until we<br>
    finish the plasma infusion.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (as she works)<br>
    Good, we're almost done here.</p>
  <p> Pran smiles vaguely at Data. There is an awkward<br>
    moment of silence. Pran glances at his wife, then<br>
    decides to go ahead.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    Data, Juliana told me what she<br>
    said to you last night. She's<br>
    been very upset...</p>
  <p> Juliana looks up at her husband, unsure if she wants<br>
    him to bring this up right now.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't blame you for being angry<br>
    with her, but --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am incapable of anger.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    There seems to be some... tension<br>
    between you...</p>
  <p> Juliana interrupts, gestures that she'll speak for<br>
    herself.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    It's all right, Pran.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I know what I told you must have<br>
    been hard for you to hear, but I<br>
    hope you can understand my<br>
    reasons.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain that I do.<br>
    Perhaps you could clarify them for<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> This is awkward for her, but she knows she owes him<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I'll try. What do you want to<br>
    know?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I had been your biological<br>
    offspring, would you have left me<br>
    behind on Omicron Theta?</p>
  <p> Juliana weighs her answer for a long moment before<br>
    replying.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Oh, Data... how can I answer that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Tainer, I have the<br>
    impression that you are trying to<br>
    spare my feelings. I assure you,<br>
    that is not necessary.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I just don't want you to<br>
    misunderstand my answer.<br>
    (beat; with difficulty)<br>
    No, I wouldn't have left you<br>
    behind if you'd been my biological<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is that because you place more<br>
    value on biological life than on<br>
    artificial life?</p>
  <p> She seems genuinely pained that he would think that.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Absolutely not. I cherished every<br>
    android your father and I created<br>
    as if it were my own child. Even<br>
    Lore.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Despite the fact that he'd turned<br>
    on us, despite everything he'd<br>
    done... dismantling him was the<br>
    most difficult thing I've ever had<br>
    to do in my life. I was afraid<br>
    that if you turned out like him...<br>
    I'd have to dismantle you, too...<br>
    and I couldn't bear that.</p>
  <p> Data takes this in.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm not trying to justify leaving<br>
    you behind... but I am sorry I<br>
    did. I hope you can believe that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do. Thank you for making it<br>
    clear to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> A wave of relief washes over her. Pran smiles, and<br>
    puts a grateful hand to Data's shoulder. Off this<br>
    moment of reconciliation...</p>
  <p>26 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> which has been converted into a recital hall. Picard,<br>
    BEVERLY, TROI, Riker, Geordi and Pran are seated amid<br>
    some SUPERNUMERARIES, enjoying the concert.</p>
  <p>27 ON DATA AND JULIANA</p>
  <p> as they near the end of their violin duet, the same<br>
    piece they practiced earlier.</p>
  <p> As he plays, Data watches her, and we see that he<br>
    detects something he finds curious.</p>
  <p>28 ON JULIANA</p>
  <p> playing intently, carefully -- a flawless performance.</p>
  <p>29 TIGHTER ON DATA</p>
  <p> we can see from his expression that there's something<br>
    about her playing that's got his attention.</p>
  <p>30 ON AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> enjoying the concert -- unaware, as are we, of what<br>
    Data has taken notice of.</p>
  <p>31 ON DATA AND JULIANA</p>
  <p> as they finish the piece. When the concert ends,<br>
    everybody stands and applauds. Data and Juliana stand<br>
    to take their bows -- and she beams happily at him,<br>
    unaware that something is weighing on his mind.</p>
  <p> When the applause dies down Data and Juliana step<br>
    forward to mingle with the others.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly approach Juliana; Data moves off<br>
    toward Troi. He seems preoccupied.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, I don't think I've ever<br>
    heard you play more...<br>
    (searches)<br>
    ... expressively.</p>

  <p> They move out of frame as Picard and Beverly address<br>
    Juliana.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That was wonderful, Doctor.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I enjoyed playing -- it's been a<br>
    while.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I see where Data gets his musical<br>
    talents.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I realize you're speaking<br>
    metaphorically, of course, but<br>
    thank you just the same.</p>
  <p>31A ON DATA</p>
  <p> as Troi moves off. Data starts toward the door, as<br>
    though on a mission, but Pran intercepts him.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Well... that was quite a<br>
    performance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Pran grows serious; it is clear he has something he<br>
    wants to say to Data.</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    You know, Data... when I found out<br>
    you were coming, I didn't know<br>
    what to expect. I've never met an<br>
    artificial life form before.</p>
  <p> Pran smiles at him... a man struggling to say the right<br>
    thing, though he's clearly uncomfortable about it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT THREE 32B.</p>
  <p>31A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PRAN<br>
    But after meeting you, I feel a<br>
    lot better. You... you're much<br>
    different from how I imagined you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I welcome you to our family.</p>
  <p> While Data appreciates Pran's gesture, it is clear that<br>
    he has something else on his mind.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you excuse me? There is<br>
    something I must do.</p>
  <p> He moves off -- leaving Pran a little puzzled by his<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data... why do you need Doctor<br>
    Tainer's medical records? Is<br>
    something wrong with her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain. Perhaps you<br>
    could determine that from her<br>
    Transporter trace pattern.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I probably could... but I don't<br>
    ordinarily look into someone's<br>
    medical status unless I have a<br>
    good reason.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor... I would ask that you not<br>
    require me to be more specific.<br>
    But I assure you that I have a<br>
    good reason for asking.</p>
  <p> Beverly regards him for a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right, Data...</p>
  <p> She moves to the large Medical Diagnostic Screen on the<br>
    wall, works some controls. Our standard anatomical<br>
    display pops up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing, studying<br>
    it)<br>
    Well... at first glance I don't<br>
    see anything wrong -- except for<br>
    some mild hypertension, which is<br>
    perfectly normal for a woman her<br>
    age.</p>

  <p> Data and Juliana ENTER and join Geordi, who has just<br>
    beamed Pran and an N.D. Atrean out of the magma pocket<br>
    where the cave-in occurred -- their uniforms and faces<br>
    are dusty. As they move off the transporter pad, Pran<br>
    walks with a limp, as if nursing a hurt leg. Juliana<br>
    moves to help him.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    What happened?</p>

    We were running a final check on<br>

    (to Data)<br>
    One of the transporter's pattern<br>
    enhancers was thrown out of<br>
    alignment by the seismic activity --<br>
    I'm getting a normal power<br>
    signature from it so you should be<br>
    able to re-align it for the beam<br>

  <p>36 INT. THE SECOND MAGMA POCKET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Data and Juliana MATERIALIZE near the THREE PATTERN<br>
    ENHANCERS, one of which is tipped over. Data rights<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> As before, the only light comes from their PALM BEACONS<br>
    and from practical sources our people have set up<br>
    previously. The low-level RUMBLE of molten magma can<br>
    be HEARD in the distance.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, there's a TREMOR -- and when it subsides, a<br>
    sharply defined ledge of about two feet separates the<br>
    floor they're standing on from the rest of the cavern --<br>
    much like an earthquake fault-line.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT FOUR 36A.</p>

  <p> Data scans it with his TRICORDER.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There will be more seismic<br>
    activity. We must hurry.</p>
  <p> Data steps up on the ledge, and Juliana follows. They<br>
    move off...</p>
  <p>37 A NARROW PASSAGEWAY</p>
  <p> as they move through it and pass out of frame.</p>
  <p>38 THE FIRST MAGMA POCKET</p>
  <p> as they approach the INFUSION UNIT. Rubble strews the<br>
    area, and it seems that the unit may have been damaged<br>
    by falling rocks. Concerned, Juliana starts working<br>
    one of the consoles. Already, the heat has caused her<br>
    to break into a sweat.</p>
  <p> Data looks up toward the ceiling, raises his Tricorder<br>
    to scan.</p>
  <p>39 THE SHAFT -- MATTE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he looks up into the shaft that we drilled from<br>
    orbit -- it's cylindrical and smooth-walled, and<br>
    although it's too dark to see much of it, we get the<br>
    sense that it leads up through miles of rock.</p>
  <p>40 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Data studies his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The shaft has not been obstructed<br>
    by the seismic activity -- it<br>
    should be possible to trigger the<br>
    unit from orbit.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (as she works)<br>
    The infuser's been damaged...<br>
    we're going to have to start the<br>
    programming sequence all over<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She continues working, and Data joins her at one of the<br>
    unit's side consoles. We hear the SOUND of rock<br>
    GROANING under pressure -- Data and Juliana glance up,<br>
    then continue working.</p>

  <p> Data and Juliana fall silent for a moment as they work.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (works)<br>
    There... now we just have to align<br>
    the diverter and --</p>
  <p> Suddenly a VIOLENT TREMOR wracks the magma pocket;<br>
    rocks and other debris fall from the ceiling and walls --<br>
    Data and Juliana have to hold on to the infusion unit<br>
    to keep from falling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data! Are you all right?</p>
  <p> Data doesn't answer until the tremor subsides.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Commander. We will be<br>
    returning to the beam-out point<br>
    shortly.</p>
  <p> Juliana finishes working -- dust kicked up by the<br>
    tremor fills the air around them...</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    That's it -- let's go.</p>
  <p> They move off...</p>
  <p>42 THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY</p>
  <p> as they head back the way the came. A small AFTERSHOCK<br>
    causes dust and debris to fall from above. They hurry<br>
    on.</p>
  <p>43 THE SECOND MAGMA POCKET</p>
  <p> as they approach the ledge that drops down to the beamout<br>
    point. They react to something --</p>
  <p>44 WIDEN</p>
  <p> so that we see that the cavern floor where the pattern<br>
    enhancers were dropped another thirty feet during the<br>
    last tremor. Juliana and Data are standing on the edge<br>
    of a precipice, there's no way to climb down its sheer<br>
    face, and the pattern enhancers are strewn on the floor<br>
    below.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    Can we transport without the<br>
    pattern enhancers?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, we are too far below the<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    How are we going to get down<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> Data looks around.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are no hand-holds in the<br>
    rock face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - 09/27/93 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly another VIOLENT TREMOR hits -- the ceiling<br>
    starts to give around them. Data has to shout to be<br>
    heard over the din.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We will have to jump.</p>
  <p> Juliana can't believe what she's hearing.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    It's too far... I won't make it...</p>
  <p> Large ROCKS crash down near them -- close, getting<br>
    closer...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You will --</p>
  <p> Data takes her firmly by the left arm and leaps off the<br>
    edge of the cliff --</p>
  <p>45 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they land on the floor below. Data is able to<br>
    absorb the shock, but Juliana hits the ground hard and<br>
    is thrown to the floor.</p>
  <p> Data moves to her and discovers that she's been knocked<br>
    unconscious. To our astonishment, her arm has been<br>
    torn off to reveal a mass of WIRES and BLINKING<br>
    CIRCUITRY -- Juliana Soong is an android.</p>
  <p> Data stares down at her arm (a small amount of blood is<br>
    visible where the skin is torn) -- strangely, he does<br>
    not seem unduly surprised by what he sees.</p>
  <p> Off this moment we...</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>46 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly and Geordi are examining the still-unconscious<br>
    Juliana, who is laid-out on the center bio-bed in a<br>
    hospital gown. Riker and Data stand nearby.</p>
  <p> Juliana's arm has been repaired, and a PANEL on her<br>
    head is open to reveal a mass of BLINKING CIRCUITRY.<br>
    As Geordi reports to Riker, we get a sense that he's<br>
    awed by the complexity of her design.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Basically, she's a Soong-type<br>
    android -- except everything about<br>
    her is designed to fool you into<br>
    thinking she's human.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's got tear ducts, sweat glands --<br>
    even veins and capillaries<br>
    underneath her skin.</p>
  <p> Riker indicates the Medical Diagnostic panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why does the scanner read her as<br>
    a human?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's a feedback processor<br>
    that's designed to send out a<br>
    false bio-signal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's tied in with her aging<br>
    program -- she not only ages in<br>
    appearance, like Data, her vital<br>
    signs change too.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What I can't figure out is why she<br>
    lost consciousness. As far as I<br>
    can see, everything's fine -- she<br>
    should be awake.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Check her positronic matrix --<br>
    there may be a cascade anomaly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE 42.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi and Beverly acknowledge and set to work. Riker<br>
    turns to Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- you said you knew she was<br>
    an android... how?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The first indication occurred when<br>
    we were drilling. I saw her<br>
    perform several complex<br>
    calculations without the<br>
    assistance of the computer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That could just have meant she was<br>
    good at math --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true. But it was enough<br>
    to draw my attention. Later, I<br>
    noticed something odd about the<br>
    way she blinked her eyes.</p>
  <p> Riker has no idea what could be coming next.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The intervals between blinks were<br>
    governed by a Fourier Series --<br>
    the same mathematical formula my<br>
    father used to give my blinking<br>
    pattern the appearance of<br>
    randomness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't imagine anyone but you<br>
    noticing something like that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then there was our concert in Ten<br>
    Forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE 43.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We had practiced the piece, and I<br>
    noticed that she played it the<br>
    same way during the performance --<br>
    every pitch, every intonation, was<br>
    exactly the same. Only an<br>
    artificial life-form could have<br>
    done that.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges that he understands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Does her husband have any idea?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe so. He is on the<br>
    surface, to monitor the plasma<br>
    infusion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's probably just as well...</p>
  <p> Geordi and Beverly find something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, take a look at this.</p>
  <p> Data crosses over and Geordi uses the point of a TOOL<br>
    to show him something inside her head panel.</p>

  <p>49 OMITTED</p>
  <p>50 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Data is standing in the ARCH. No program is running so<br>
    the GRID LINES are visible. He has a PANEL OPEN, and<br>
    holds an OPTICAL CHIP in his hand.</p>
  <p>51 INSERT - THE OPTICAL CHIP</p>
  <p> we can see that the chip from Juliana's head has been<br>
    mounted on it.</p>
  <p>52 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Data slides the optical chip into a slot. The<br>
    machine HUMS to life, and after a beat, a hologram of<br>
    DOCTOR NOONIAN SOONG APPEARS on the grid. He's about<br>
    sixty, and conducts himself with curmudgeonly self-assurance.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Whoever you are, if you're<br>
    watching this, you must have found<br>
    out about Juliana.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I programmed this hologram to<br>
    answer any questions you might<br>
    have -- I'm Noonian Soong; I<br>
    created her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am Data.</p>
  <p> Soong reacts, breaks into a broad smile.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Data -- I hoped somehow it might<br>
    be you... I even created a<br>
    response program to answer your<br>
    questions. How are you, boy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am fine.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    I'm glad you got the chance to<br>
    meet your mother.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You refer to Doctor Tainer as my<br>
    mother -- yet the complexity of<br>
    her design indicates she was<br>
    created after I was.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    You're right, but there was a real<br>
    Juliana O'Donnell. She was my<br>
    wife; she helped me create you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What happened to her?</p>
  <p> Soong's demeanor quiets as he recounts the story.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    She was injured when the<br>
    Crystalline Entity attacked... we<br>
    made it to Terlina Three, but then<br>
    she lapsed into a comatose<br>
    state...</p>
  <p> It's obvious that Soong felt deeply when he recorded<br>
    this.</p>

  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When I realized nothing could be<br>
    done for her, I built an android<br>
    and started trying to perfect my<br>
    synaptic scanning technique -- so<br>
    I could transfer her memories into<br>
    a positronic matrix. I didn't<br>
    know if it would work, but I had<br>
    to try. I couldn't stand the<br>
    thought of losing the only woman<br>
    I ever loved.</p>
  <p> A pause as he remembers.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A few days after Juliana died...<br>
    I activated the android. She<br>
    looked up at me... and she smiled.</p>
  <p> He smiles as he remembers the moment.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    She recognized me. It had worked!<br>
    Here was a life not two minutes<br>
    old, and as far as she knew I was<br>
    her husband and she'd just<br>
    recovered from a terrible injury.<br>
    It was incredible.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you never told her the truth?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    Why? There was no reason for her<br>
    to know. I wanted her to be<br>
    happy. I wanted us to be happy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And we were... for a while,<br>
    anyway...</p>
  <p> His face falters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I made a terrible mistake... I<br>
    never really let her know how much<br>
    I loved her...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/29/93 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> His voice is full of regret.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    She left me... The real Juliana<br>
    probably would've, too, if she'd<br>
    lived.</p>
  <p> He seems lost in thought for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If she recovers and learns that<br>
    she is an android --</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    She doesn't have to know. I<br>
    designed her to shut down in the<br>
    event the truth was discovered.<br>
    When you re-insert the chip,<br>
    she'll wake up and remember<br>
    nothing. All you have to do is<br>
    make up some excuse about what<br>
    happened to her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then... you do not believe she<br>
    should know the truth.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    The truth is that in every way<br>
    that matters, she is Juliana<br>
    Soong.</p>
  <p> Soong is certain of everything he's saying, and clearly<br>
    wants to convince Data.</p>
  <p> SOONG<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've programmed her to terminate<br>
    after a long life. Let her live<br>
    out the rest of her days, and die<br>
    believing she was human. Don't<br>
    rob her of that, son. Please.</p>
  <p> Data takes this in. Off his troubled expression...</p>

  <p>53 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Beverly and Data are discussing the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It seems that I must make a<br>
    decision: to tell Doctor Tainer<br>
    that she is an android -- or<br>
    withhold that knowledge from her.<br>
    And I do not know what to do.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why was Doctor Soong so adamant<br>
    that she not be told?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He seemed certain that if she<br>
    knew, it would preclude the<br>
    possibility of her being happy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And -- what do you think?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can understand why my father<br>
    felt as he did -- but his wishes<br>
    are not necessarily paramount. I<br>
    am concerned with what would be<br>
    best for -- my mother.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wouldn't she be better off knowing<br>
    the truth? Dealing with the<br>
    reality of her existence?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think so. She's believed<br>
    she's human all her life. The<br>
    truth might be devastating to her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have noticed that her present<br>
    husband seems uncomfortable with<br>
    the fact that I am an artificial<br>
    life-form. If he finds out about<br>
    his wife, it may adversely affect<br>
    their relationship.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He doesn't have to know -- if you<br>
    tell her, it would be up to her<br>
    whether or not to tell him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, there might come a time in<br>
    the future when she would find out<br>
    anyway -- another accident, for<br>
    example. Perhaps it would be<br>
    easier for her to learn the truth<br>
    from you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can tell you that if I were in<br>
    her place... I'd rather have my<br>
    son tell me than some stranger...</p>
  <p> Data wrestles with this weighty decision. His friends<br>
    have tried to help him, but there is no clear road.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I find that I am having difficulty<br>
    separating what would be best for<br>
    her... from what would be best for<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If she knew she were an android,<br>
    she and I would have something to<br>
    share. I would no longer be alone<br>
    in the universe.</p>
  <p> The others take this in, touched by Data's plight.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know how much that would mean to<br>
    you... but at the same time,<br>
    telling her would rob her of the<br>
    one thing you've wanted all your<br>
    life -- to be human.</p>
  <p> This cuts to the core of Data's dilemma.</p>

  <p> Data looks down at her for a long moment -- what will<br>
    he tell her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You were knocked unconscious by<br>

  <p>56 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Atrea.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. The<br>
    infusion of plasma into the core<br>
    of Atrea Four has been<br>
    accomplished. Pran Tainer's<br>
    projections indicate that the core<br>
    will remain molten for several<br>
    hundred years.</p>
  <p>57 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is saying goodbye to his mother. An N.D. stands<br>
    at the Transporter controls.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    When will I see you again?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I can visit Atrea on my<br>
    next leave.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    I'd like that very much.</p>
  <p> She smiles, looks at him for what may be the last time<br>
    in a long while.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well... I'd better be going...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mother... I remembered something<br>
    that I thought you should know.</p>
  <p> She waits for him to continue.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Before he died, my father told me<br>
    that he had only one great love in<br>
    his life... and that he regretted<br>
    never letting her know how much he<br>
    cared for her.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am certain he was referring to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Juliana is touched by this knowledge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Inheritance&quot; - REV. 09/28/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    That's nice to know...</p>
  <p> She smiles inwardly, as if something's just occurred to<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    On Atrea they have a saying...<br>
    that a child born from parents who<br>
    love each other will have nothing<br>
    but goodness in his heart...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I guess that explains you...</p>
  <p> Data is struck by her words. She leans forward and<br>
    kisses his cheek.</p>
  <p> JULIANA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Take care of yourself, son.</p>
  <p> She moves to the Transporter Pad, turns back -- and<br>
    their eyes meet for a last time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good-bye, Mother.</p>
  <p> The N.D. works the controls and Juliana DEMATERIALIZES.<br>
    Off Data's face as he watches...</p>
  <p>58 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves away we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
