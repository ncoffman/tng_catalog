    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS - ANGLE ON DOOR</p>
  <p> The door CHIME sounds.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    (harried)<br>
    Come in!</p>
  <p> The DOOR OPENS and DATA ENTERS. He looks around the<br>
    room for a moment -- it's apparently empty.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    I'm in here...</p>
  <p> The voice is coming from the bedroom. As Data moves<br>
    toward it, he sees PIECES OF A BROKEN VASE strewn all<br>
    over the floor.</p>
  <p>2 THE BEDROOM</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS the bedroom to see GEORDI on his hands and<br>
    knees, looking at something under the bed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've got her now, Data... she's<br>
    trapped.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> Geordi gives him a sharp look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Your demented cat.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the other side of the bed and peers<br>
    curiously underneath.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand. Why is Spot<br>
    under the bed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - 09/17/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Probably because she knows I'll<br>
    kill her if I get my hands on her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Has Spot been misbehaving?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's putting it mildly. So far<br>
    she's broken a vase and a teapot,<br>
    destroyed my couch by using it as<br>
    a scratching post, and coughed up<br>
    hairballs on my carpet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    These incidents are common to cat<br>
    owners. When you borrowed Spot,<br>
    you said you wanted to experience<br>
    the full range of feline behavior<br>
    before getting a cat yourself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, well, I don't think I'm<br>
    ready for one. You can take her<br>
    back, with my blessings.</p>
  <p> A beat as Data stares under the bed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well? Go ahead -- call her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spot does not respond to verbal<br>
    commands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She won't come when you call her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, have you ever considered<br>
    training her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (pondering)<br>
    I have never found it to be<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Necessary? That cat is out of<br>
    control.<br>

  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    Half the time I wasn't sure if she<br>
    was going to lick me or scratch my<br>
    face off.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have never experienced that kind<br>
    of behavior from Spot.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Although she does have the<br>
    unfortunate habit of jumping onto<br>
    my computer console when I am<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There, see? She needs training.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to senior staff. Please<br>
    report to the observation lounge.<br>
    Mission briefing in ten minutes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, we have to get her out from<br>
    under there. I'll scare her --<br>
    you grab her when she comes out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not think it would be wise to<br>
    startle her --</p>
  <p> But Geordi makes his move.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now!</p>
  <p> SPOT goes streaking out from under the bed -- not<br>
    toward Data -- and dashes into the other room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh-oh...</p>
  <p> There's a resounding CRASH from the next room. Geordi<br>
    casts a baleful eye at Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Training.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Definitely.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47310.2.<br>
    We are investigating the<br>
    disappearance of the Medical<br>
    Transport Fleming somewhere in the<br>
    Hekaras Corridor. Our search is<br>
    complicated by the unique<br>
    properties of this particular<br>
    region of space.</p>
  <p>4 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, Data, TROI, BEVERLY, WORF, and Geordi<br>
    are seated at the conference table. The mood is upbeat --<br>
    even though the mission is serious, it's still fairly<br>
    routine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Fleming's last contact with<br>
    Starfleet was four days ago. They<br>
    didn't report anything out of the<br>
    ordinary when they entered the<br>
    Corridor...</p>
  <p> Riker nods to Data who rises and moves to the large<br>
    monitor which is displaying an OKUDAGRAM of a subspace<br>
    map of the Hekaras Corridor. The graphic indicates a<br>
    long, path-like trail threading its way through several<br>
    star systems.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The unusually intense tetryon<br>
    fields in this sector pose a<br>
    severe navigational hazard to warpdriven<br>
    vessels...</p>
  <p> Data indicates the path-like structure on the graphic.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - 09/17/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Hekaras Corridor is the only<br>
    route through the area which is<br>
    free of tetryon fields. Ships<br>
    travelling at warp must use the<br>
    Corridor to ensure safe passage<br>
    through the region.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will it take to complete<br>
    a level-one search?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At least two days, sir. The<br>
    Corridor is over twelve lightyears<br>
    long, and the surrounding<br>
    tetryon interference will limit<br>
    our sensor range.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Data takes his seat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Could we send out reconnaissance<br>
    probes to supplement the sensors?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They won't be very effective. The<br>
    interference will make it<br>
    difficult to maintain contact with<br>
    the probes; the best we can do is<br>
    to try increasing the sensor<br>
    efficiency.<br>
    (beat; to Picard)<br>
    We're installing multi-phase<br>
    buffers on all the sensor modules.<br>
    It should help a little.</p>
  <p> Troi, meanwhile, has been studying the graphic.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hekaras Two is inhabited, isn't<br>
    it? Maybe they've had contact<br>
    with the Fleming.</p>
  <p> Riker shakes his head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They haven't. I've already spoken<br>
    with the Hekaran government.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    According to them, only one ship<br>
    has passed through their system in<br>
    the last week... and that was a<br>
    Ferengi trader.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Fleming was carrying a supply<br>
    of bio-mimetic gel... it's rare<br>
    and quite valuable. Do you think<br>
    it's possible the Ferengi could<br>
    have hijacked it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (considers)<br>
    I wouldn't put it past them.<br>
    (beat; to Picard)<br>
    We should be prepared for that<br>
    contingency.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Picard makes his decisions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All right then. Mister Worf,<br>
    initiate your search pattern.<br>
    Let's head in.</p>
  <p> The meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4A INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi is at the warp core. The DILITHIUM CHAMBER is<br>
    open and he is working intently on the innards with a<br>
    TECH TOOL. Several N.D.s are working in the b.g.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS and moves to Geordi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, we have experienced a<br>
    slight drop in sensor efficiency.<br>
    Commander Riker would like us to<br>
    examine the phase buffers.</p>
  <p> Geordi does not look up from his work immediately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No problem, Data... I'll be with<br>
    you in a minute...</p>
  <p> Geordi works another beat and then turns to an N.D.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All right, Hansen, transfer EPS<br>
    conduit thirteen through the<br>
    stabilizer matrix.</p>
  <p> VOICE (O.C.)<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi closes the chamber, moves to another console and<br>
    continues working. Data follows him, curious.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, is there a problem with<br>
    the engines?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, not really...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then why are you stabilizing the<br>
    EPS conduit?</p>
  <p> A beat. Geordi looks up from the console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm just trying to get a slightly<br>
    higher power conversion level...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (considering it)<br>
    That would not affect the engines<br>
    in any way.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know. That's not the point.</p>
  <p> Data seems puzzled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE 7B.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then... what is &quot;the point?&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (a bit evasive)<br>
    I just... want the best conversion<br>
    level I can get.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> There is a beat. Somewhat reluctantly...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's the Intrepid.<br>
    (off Data's reaction)<br>
    Their Chief Engineer is Commander<br>
    Donald Kaplan. We went through<br>
    the Academy together. And... I<br>
    kind of like to make sure our<br>
    power conversion level is... a<br>
    little higher than theirs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand. You are in<br>
    competition with Mister Kaplan.</p>
  <p> Geordi doesn't want to admit to that.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, it's not really a<br>
    competition...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is the flagship. It just<br>
    seems to me -- we should be better<br>
    than the rest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That does sound like a competitive<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's more a matter of personal<br>
    pride. I mean... these are my<br>
    engines.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But you are trying to outperform<br>
    the Intrepid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/24/93 - ACT ONE 7C.</p>
  <p>4A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... yeah.</p>
  <p> Geordi works the console for a beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer. How much have the<br>
    conversion levels increased?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Levels are unchanged.</p>
  <p> Geordi's frustration is evident as Data waits<br>
    patiently.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All right, we'll deal with of this<br>
    later...</p>
  <p> Geordi grabs a TECH TOOL and moves toward the Jefferies<br>
    tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's take a look at those<br>
    sensors.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi EXIT into the Jefferies tube.</p>
  <p>5 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are moving through a section of the<br>
    VERTICAL JEFFERIES TUBE. They stop at a junction, and<br>
    Geordi opens a MEESPANEL. He begins to work on it with<br>
    a TECH TOOL as Data monitors his progress with a<br>
    TRICORDER.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay -- how's that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The phase buffer is functioning<br>
    within normal parameters. Sensor<br>
    efficiency has increased six-point-seven<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi closes the panel, still not quite satisfied.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Only six-point-seven? One of the<br>
    stages must still be out of<br>
    alignment...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's check out junction A-nine.</p>
  <p> Data acknowledges and they begin to climb down the<br>
    tube.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, I have taken your<br>
    suggestion regarding Spot.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What suggestion?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have begun to train her. I am<br>
    currently testing several<br>
    techniques.</p>
  <p> Geordi isn't really interested to hear about Data's<br>
    cat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Really...</p>
  <p> Data continues talking as they move into a horizontal<br>
    section...</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER JEFFERIES TUBE - HORIZONTAL SECTION</p>
  <p> Moving along the tube...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I began with simple conditioned<br>
    response exercises and followed<br>
    with various environmental<br>
    enhancements. Next I intend to<br>
    explore bio-conditioning devices.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Devices?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Such as sensor nets for behavior<br>
    modification... or bio-feedback<br>
    motivators...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Unfortunately, I have been largely<br>
    unsuccessful...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi stops at a MEESPANEL and opens it up. He takes<br>
    out his (TECH) tool and begins working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (kidding)<br>
    How about a phaser? A low stun<br>
    setting at the right moment might<br>
    do the trick...</p>
  <p> Data reacts -- he's taking the suggestion seriously.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi. I will not stun my cat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was just kidding...</p>
  <p> Geordi works for another moment, then closes the panel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This isn't it, either.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is clearly a misalignment<br>
    somewhere in this system.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's for sure...<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    There's one more possibility...<br>
    let's take a look at junction C-twelve...</p>
  <p> They move off down the tube...</p>
  <p>6A JEFFERIES TUBE - ANOTHER SECTION</p>
  <p> moving along the tube...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am somewhat concerned that my<br>
    training efforts will ultimately<br>
    fail...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, maybe you're just going<br>
    about it the wrong way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Force of Nature&quot; - REV. 09/23/93 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>6A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have consulted numerous animal<br>
    behavior manuals; several of them<br>
    claim that cats are inherently<br>
    untrainable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't believe that. My sister<br>
    didn't know a thing about animals<br>
    and she was able to train her cat.<br>
    How complicated could it be?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (curious)<br>
    What did she train her cat to do?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinks about it)<br>
    Well... her cat would jump into<br>
    her arms on command.</p>
  <p> Data is intrigued by the notion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is interesting. Perhaps I<br>
    could modify your sister's<br>
    technique to keep Spot off my<br>
    console. Do you know how she was<br>
    able to train her cat?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (amused)<br>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, and Geordi are at the table with<br>
    Rabal and Serova. The two N.D. Security Guards stand<br>
    nearby, phasers holstered, closely flanking the aliens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard, to Rabal)<br>
    You've made a very serious<br>
    accusation. I want you to explain<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Rabal is a mature, reasonable man but he's extremely<br>
    passionate and determined.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Captain, according to our<br>
    research, warp fields are causing<br>
    a dangerous reaction in this<br>
    region of space.</p>
  <p> Serova is younger than Rabal, and she seems more<br>
    determined and less inclined to listen to reason.</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    Our planet is already being<br>
    affected. We have measured large<br>
    gravitational shifts throughout<br>
    our system.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    If something isn't done, our<br>
    planet will become uninhabitable.</p>
  <p> There's a beat as Picard considers the implications of<br>
    what they're saying. If they are right, then the<br>
    situation demands study. Geordi, however, is openly<br>
    skeptical of their claims.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, I've heard this theory<br>
    before. Their research was<br>
    evaluated by the Federation<br>
    Science Council a few years ago.<br>
    Their claims just didn't hold up.</p>
  <p> Serova bristles.</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    That research was only<br>
    preliminary. Our original<br>
    analysis was incomplete...</p>
  <p> Picard understands their position, but he doesn't care<br>
    for their methods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, if you wanted us to review<br>
    your research, you could have<br>
    placed a request through the<br>
    Science Council.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Their resources are limited. It<br>
    would have taken over a year<br>
    before they dispatched a science<br>
    ship to come and evaluate our<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    We were not willing to wait any<br>
    longer.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We knew that if we disabled enough<br>
    ships, Starfleet would come. Then<br>
    at least we would be able to<br>
    present our case...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's how you rationalize these<br>
    attacks?</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    Neither you nor the Ferengi<br>
    suffered any casualties,<br>
    Commander. The actual damage to<br>
    your vessels was negligible.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    We dispersed verteron probes in<br>
    the Corridor only to disable warpdriven<br>
    ships... nothing more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can call it whatever you like.<br>
    The fact remains that you<br>
    deliberately disguised your<br>
    probes. You made them look like<br>
    signal markers... You hid them in<br>
    debris fields... You mined the<br>
    Corridor.</p>
  <p> There's an uncomfortable silence. Both Rabal and<br>
    Serova realize they've taken some pretty extreme<br>
    measures, but they're not going to apologize for it.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers his options.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mister La Forge, how long do you<br>
    estimate it will take to restore<br>
    the engines?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Their verteron pulse overloaded<br>
    our field coils, sir... it'll take<br>
    at least thirty-six hours to get<br>
    underway.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Rabal and Serova.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    I know precisely how our pulse<br>
    affected your field coils. With<br>
    my help, your ship could be<br>
    operational in ten hours...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Provided you agree to review our<br>
    research.</p>
  <p> Picard fixes Serova with a hard stare; he is not going<br>
    to be forced into this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because of the seriousness of your<br>
    claims, I'm willing to listen to<br>
    your case. But make no mistake.<br>
    Our priority here is the recovery<br>
    of the Fleming.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I expect you to help us restore<br>
    our systems and deactivate all<br>
    your remaining probes in the<br>
    Corridor...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you do not, I will put you both<br>
    in the brig and take you to the<br>
    nearest Starbase where you'll face<br>
    charges for what you've done.</p>
  <p> Serova is unrepentant and she's not backing down;<br>
    Rabal, however, is willing to compromise.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    My sister and I have no wish to<br>
    impede your rescue efforts --</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    Rabal, don't. The probes are the<br>

    Mister La Forge, take them to<br>
    Engineering and get the core back<br>
    on-line.</p>
  <p> Geordi isn't happy at the prospect of working with<br>
    these people, but there isn't much of a choice.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, begin a review of<br>
    their research. I'd like your<br>
    report as soon as possible.</p>
  <p> Data nods, then Data, Geordi, Rabal, and Serova EXIT,<br>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>26 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi, Rabal, and Serova are working in and around the<br>
    area of the warp core. All three have PADDS. The warp<br>
    core is still dark. Serova works a console and the<br>
    warp core begins to PULSE SLOWLY. She checks a panel.</p>
  <p> SEROVA<br>
    There... shields have been<br>
    restored. You'll be able to reengage<br>

    approximately eight hours.</p>
  <p> Geordi checks the panel himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What if the Fleming had been<br>

    I'd have to agree with that...</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    But please try to understand...<br>
    she believes profoundly in this<br>
    cause. She has sworn to dedicate<br>
    her life to exposing the dangers<br>
    of warp drive.</p>

    years ago...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You mean you didn't believe her,<br>
    either?</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    No. What I didn't realize... was<br>
    how brilliant my sister is. It<br>
    took two years of study for me<br>
    even to grasp the principles<br>
    behind her theoretical models...<br>
    they're that sophisticated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, our Commander Data is no<br>
    slouch. If there's anything<br>
    there, he'll find it.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    I hope so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Because once we persuade Starfleet<br>
    to stop warp travel through the<br>
    Corridor... we will have to<br>
    convince our own people to give up<br>
    warp drive completely.</p>
  <p> It's an unexpected notion.</p>

    Hekaras Two is the only inhabited<br>
    world in this region. Without<br>
    warp drive, you'd be completely<br>
    isolated from the rest of the<br>
    Federation. Are you really<br>
    willing to take that step?</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Yes. And if you were in my<br>

  <p> Data is giving his report to Picard as Rabal and Serova<br>
    listen anxiously. Data is standing in front of a<br>
    monitor which displays a SUBSPACE FIELD MAP of the<br>
    Corridor (NOTE: this OKUDAGRAM should be based on the<br>
    map seen in Act 1); several pocket-like regions inside<br>
    the Corridor are highlighted.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to Serova and Rabal's<br>
    theory, there are regions of<br>
    potential subspace instability<br>
    within the Corridor...</p>
  <p> Data indicates the pockets on the map.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They believe that if these regions<br>
    continue to be exposed to warp<br>
    field energy, they will rupture --<br>
    subspace will extrude into normal<br>
    space, forming a rift.</p>

    At this time, there is<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In order to determine whether or<br>
    not a rift would form, we would<br>
    have to expose a region of the<br>
    Corridor to warp field energy<br>
    approximately one-million times<br>
    greater than that normally<br>
    generated by a starship.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Commander, we believe the warp<br>
    field effect is cumulative. Each<br>
    starship that passes through the<br>
    Corridor at warp brings us one<br>
    step closer to forming a rift.</p>

    A more detailed investigation<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, is it possible for a ship<br>

  <p> Rabal doesn't respond, his eyes remaining fixed on the<br>

  <p> Picard moves to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    I'm sorry about your loss... but<br>
    we need your help now.</p>
  <p> Rabal tries to focus.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Of course, Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does the rift pose any danger to<br>
    the Fleming?</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    I... I don't know...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES strongly, then stops. Picard<br>
    and Riker exchange a concerned glance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> Geordi studies the Aft Science console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Some kind of high energy<br>
    distortion wave... it looks like<br>
    they're being generated from<br>
    within the rift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As long as we maintain our current<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can we risk going in there to get<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not at warp, sir.<br>
    (off console)<br>
    According to these readings, the<br>
    rift is in a state of accelerating<br>
    instability -- which would make it<br>
    extremely sensitive to warp field<br>
    energy. If we go in at warp, we<br>
    might make it expand even further.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think we have a choice.<br>
    It would take weeks to reach them<br>

  <p> The SHIP SHAKES from another distortion wave. Geordi<br>
    and Data exchange a look -- they're running out of<br>

  <p> Data studies the console for a beat and then turns to<br>
    Rabal.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, is it possible there are<br>
    areas inside the rift which are<br>
    stable... where we could safely<br>
    use our warp engines?</p>
  <p> Rabal still seems a little shell-shocked. He moves to<br>
    the console and studies the monitor.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Perhaps...<br>

  <p> Geordi's attention stays fixed on the monitor -- he's<br>

  <p> RABAL<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In the meantime, we'll have to<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I suggest we coast into the rift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Coast?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We can initiate a brief, high-intensity<br>
    warp pulse from our<br>
    current position. We should be<br>
    able to attain sufficient velocity<br>
    to enter the rift, beam the crew<br>
    off the Fleming and exit --<br>
    without using our warp engines.</p>
  <p> It's a risky plan.</p>
  <p> The SHIP SHAKES again from a distortion wave. The men<br>
    react.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right. Let's say we initiate<br>
    a full power warp pulse... how<br>
    much time will we have before we<br>
    drop out of warp?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we field-saturate the nacelles,<br>
    we should be able to sustain warp<br>
    speed for approximately two<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's not much time... and it<br>
    could get pretty rough in there.</p>
  <p> Data nods, agreeing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our timing will be critical.</p>
  <p> Picard makes his decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    I don't think we can get any more<br>

  <p>45AA CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to the warp core, looking at it<br>
    thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Between the two of us we've logged<br>
    thousands of hours on these<br>
    engines. We're supposed to be<br>
    warp field experts. But this time<br>
    we certainly were wrong.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Technically, Geordi, we were not<br>
    wrong. Serova's theories rested<br>
    on assumptions which were<br>
    unprovable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Seems to me she managed to prove<br>
    them pretty conclusively...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But only by using methods which a<br>
    reputable scientist would never<br>
    employ.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... she was willing to die to<br>
    make her point.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We should have listened to her<br>
    more closely.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We reviewed Serova's research to<br>
    the best of our ability, and we<br>
    were prepared to continue studying<br>
    the problem. But that was not<br>
    satisfactory.</p>
  <p> Geordi is trying to understand his own feelings here<br>
    and the realizations are not coming easily.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can remember times when I've<br>
    been a little stubborn... trying<br>
    to get people to believe me when<br>
    I didn't have enough proof...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe that you would<br>
    have resorted to such extremes.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But she had to... to make us<br>
    listen. Why? Why was I so<br>
    resistant?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps because the aggressive<br>
    methods she chose created an<br>
    adversarial situation.</p>
  <p> This exchange is helping Geordi hone his self-examination.<br>
    He begins to narrow the field...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Or maybe I was taking the whole<br>
    thing personally.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand...</p>
  <p> Geordi ponders, trying to understand it himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe it was all a little<br>
    threatening to me... the thought<br>
    that warp engines might be doing<br>
    some kind of damage.</p>
  <p> He circles around the warp engine, assessing it.</p>

    it's possible there was something<br>
    I missed...</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    No. You didn't miss anything.<br>
    The problem was time. It would've<br>
    taken time to do the proper<br>
    research... and Serova wasn't<br>
    willing to wait.</p>
  <p> Geordi is silent for a beat... then...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our scans have shown a lot of<br>
    subspace instabilities all through<br>
    the sector. If they're exposed to<br>
    enough warp energy, they might<br>
    eventually create other rifts.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    Based on current warp drive<br>
    patterns in the sector, we've<br>
    projected where subspace rifts<br>
    will be most likely to form in the<br>
    next forty years.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Until we can find a way to<br>

    Putting limits on warp speed is<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Unfortunately, right now there's<br>
    not much we can do.</p>
  <p> RABAL<br>
    My planet is not in immediate<br>
    danger, but the gravitational<br>
    shifts are already beginning to<br>
    affect its orbit. Our climate is<br>
    changing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet is setting up a weather<br>
    control network for Hekaras Two.<br>
    It's only a temporary solution,<br>
    but it should suffice for now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were lucky the rift formed as<br>
    far away from the planet as it<br>
    did. At least we have a little<br>
    time to consider our options.</p>
  <p> A beat as the scale of the problem sinks in.</p>

    If there are no further questions,<br>
    you're dismissed.</p>
  <p> As the group files out of the room, Picard rises and<br>
    moves to the window and looks out into space. Geordi<br>
    notices this and lingers behind. He moves to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We should have the thermal<br>

    It's not going to turn out that<br>
