    &quot;Firstborn&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where CANDLES and other Klingon ARTIFACTS are arranged<br>
    around the DIMLY LIT room. WORF, dressed in Klingon<br>
    CEREMONIAL ROBES, paces back and forth, talking to<br>
    himself -- he's practicing a speech.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    -- as time passes, a boy<br>
    inevitably becomes a man. What is<br>
    not inevitable, is that a man<br>
    become a warrior. A warrior must<br>
    be forged like a sword, tempered<br>
    by...<br>
    (searches for word)<br>
    -- by experience. The path of the<br>
    warrior begins --</p>
  <p> He's interrupted when the DOOR OPENS and ALEXANDER<br>
    rushes in with an excited look on his face. He hurries<br>
    past Worf and toward his room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander --</p>
  <p> Before Worf can continue, the door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Alexander stops, turns --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No, wait --</p>
  <p> But it's too late -- the door OPENS and a multi-faceted<br>
    high-tech WATER BALLOON sails through it and hits Worf<br>
    smack in the chest, drenching him.</p>
  <p> We reveal a ERIC BURTON, a HUMAN about Alexander's age<br>
    standing in the doorway; his hand flies to his mouth as<br>
    he realizes what he's done.</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    Sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf looks down at his chest, then up at the boy, who<br>
    decides not to wait around to see how this big Klingon<br>
    is going to react to his mistake -- he turns and<br>
    scampers off down the hall.</p>
  <p> Worf turns toward Alexander, who's frozen in place,<br>
    waiting to see how his dad is going to take what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is the meaning of this?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm sorry. We made Fullerenes in<br>
    chemistry class and filled them<br>
    with water --</p>
  <p> Worf interrupts; he has more important things on his<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I asked you to meet me here after<br>
    school. I have been waiting for<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Alexander realizes --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I forgot.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You forgot because you allowed<br>
    yourself to be distracted by<br>
    foolishness.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is something important I<br>
    want to discuss with you.</p>
  <p> He gestures that Alexander take a seat. Alexander<br>
    looks around; his father is obviously up to something<br>
    that has to do with Klington culture and the boy is a<br>
    little wary.</p>
  <p> Worf launches into his speech -- even though he<br>
    practiced it, there's an edge of nervousness in his<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As time passes, a boy inevitably<br>
    becomes a man. What is not<br>
    inevitable, is that a man become<br>
    a sword --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Worf realizes his mistake, corrects himself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I meant warrior...</p>
  <p> Worf lets out a frustrated breath, tries to get back on<br>
    track.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The path of the warrior begins<br>
    with the First Rite of Ascension.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Is that where they hit you with<br>
    pain sticks?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, that is the Second Rite.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Oh...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are approaching the age of<br>
    ascension... it is time for you to<br>
    prepare for the ceremony.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    What do I have to do?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your fighting skills will be<br>
    tested... and your knowledge of<br>
    the teachings of Kahless. It is<br>
    very challenging, but I will help<br>
    you prepare.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a thick CANDLE and hands it to Alexander,<br>
    then takes a second candle for himself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is a kor'tova candle... it<br>
    represents the fire that burns in<br>
    a warrior's heart.</p>
  <p> Worf lights his from a large burning candle on the<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When you light yours, you will be<br>
    declaring your intention to become<br>
    a warrior.</p>
  <p> Alexander holds his candle, uncertain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What if... I don't want to?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you do not participate in the<br>
    rite before you are thirteen years<br>
    of age, you will never be able to<br>
    become a true Klingon warrior.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I don't care about that...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You may not care now, but someday<br>
    you might.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Mother always said that I didn't<br>
    have to do any of this Klingon<br>
    stuff if I didn't want to.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is your decision... but --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Good, then I'm not going to do it.</p>
  <p> Alexander puts the candle down and starts to stand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You just said it was up to me.<br>
    And I don't want to be a warrior.</p>
  <p> And with that he turns and EXITS to his room... the<br>
    door shuts behind him. Worf is disappointed,<br>
    frustrated... Off his troubled expression we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>2 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> where PICARD, RIKER, DATA and Worf are concluding a<br>
    mission briefing. Worf seems distracted, his mind<br>
    elsewhere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As a result, the Kearsarge won't<br>
    be able to rendezvous with us for<br>
    another four days.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will we be holding position here<br>
    until it arrives?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. And, as it looks as though<br>
    we'll have a few days of relative<br>
    quiet, I'm going to take advantage<br>
    of the time by visiting the<br>
    Hatarian System. There are<br>
    ancient ruins there just being<br>
    excavated.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The delay will also make it<br>
    possible for Stellar Dynamics to<br>
    complete their study of the Vodrey<br>
    Nebula.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll let them know they can have<br>
    more access to the lateral sensor<br>
    grid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    This might be a good time to<br>
    recalibrate the weapon targeting<br>
    array.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't seem to have heard him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf snaps out of it, focuses.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir. I will begin the<br>
    procedure immediately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good.<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Everyone stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to Worf)<br>
    Lieutenant... could I have a word<br>
    with you?</p>
  <p> Picard waits for Data and Riker to EXIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Several times during the briefing<br>
    you seemed a bit... distracted.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns; he hoped to be able to conceal it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I apologize. In the future, I<br>
    will make sure my personal affairs<br>
    do not interfere with my duties.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is everything all right?</p>
  <p> Worf considers before deciding to confide in Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I... am having problems with<br>
    Alexander. He has made it clear<br>
    that he does not wish to<br>
    participate in the First Rite of<br>
    Ascension.</p>
  <p> Picard knows enough about Klingon culture to understand<br>
    why this is important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have tried to tell him that it<br>
    is an important part of a young<br>
    Klington's life, but he does not<br>
    understand...</p>
  <p> Picard senses Worf blames himself, tries to point out<br>
    the larger context.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's had so little opportunity to<br>
    spend time among Klingons... I<br>
    doubt if he fully appreciates what<br>
    a rich cultural heritage he comes<br>
    from.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The festival of Kot'baval begins<br>
    tomorrow. If he could take part<br>
    in it, he would see that there is<br>
    much more to Klingon life than<br>
    what I have been able to show<br>
    him... if only we were nearer the<br>
    homeworld.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about the Klingon outpost on<br>
    Maranga Four... I'm sure they'll<br>
    celebrate the festival there.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... but the outpost is on the<br>
    far side of the Vodrey Nebula, it<br>
    is three days away by shuttle...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise could be there in<br>
    a fraction of that time, and still<br>
    be back here for our rendezvous.</p>
  <p> Worf is grateful, but doesn't feel right about<br>
    detouring the entire ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I could not ask you to --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm willing to bet Stellar<br>
    Dynamics would like nothing better<br>
    than to make a trip around the<br>
    Nebula; it'll give them the chance<br>
    to study it that much more<br>
    thoroughly.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Picard, grateful... Off this moment...</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it approaches Maranga Four.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. KLINGON OUTPOST - DAY</p>
  <p> where the festival of Kot'baval is in progress.<br>
    Although there are signs of modernity, the town square<br>
    has an ancient, almost medieval feel to it -- it has<br>
    heavy stone walls, and little storefronts where<br>
    colorful Klingon wares are sold.</p>
  <p> A Klingon street opera is being performed in the town<br>
    square. TWO KLINGONS are singing and engaging in mockcombat,<br>
    accompanied by LIVE MUSICIANS who are making a<br>
    din only a Klingon could love. The two performers are<br>
    elaborately clad in colorful ROBES, and their BAT'LETH<br>
    SWORDS have little BELLS all around their frames that<br>
    jangle as they fight -- whenever one of them executes<br>
    a particularly good move he'll raise the sword above<br>
    his head and shake it vigorously, bellowing some<br>
    unintelligible Klingon lyric at the same time.</p>
  <p> Enterprise crewmembers, including GEORDI and BEVERLY,<br>
    fill out the crowd of N.D. KLINGONS who crane their<br>
    heads to watch what is going on. Alexander stands next<br>
    to Worf, watching the spectacle with wide eyes.</p>
  <p> A vendor passes nearby and Worf calls out to her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Bok'ta ku'mo. (over here)</p>
  <p> She approaches and Worf hands her a coin -- she gives<br>
    him a bag of live worms. Worf takes a sumptuous<br>
    handful, then hands the bag to Alexander, who's so busy<br>
    watching the opera that he takes a mouthful without<br>
    really looking at what it is. To Worf's surprise, he<br>
    likes it, and keeps chewing without comment...</p>
  <p> Behind them, at the rear of the crowd, we REVEAL that a<br>
    KLINGON of about fifty is intently watching Worf and<br>
    Alexander. He's wearing battle gear, and his forehead<br>
    ridges are somewhat less pronounced than what we're<br>
    used to seeing.</p>
  <p> As father and son watch, the larger of the two<br>
    performers fells the smaller one and sings out<br>
    triumphantly, rattling his BAT'LETH in victory.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who's that?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is the tyrant Molor. He was<br>
    so strong that no one could stand<br>
    against him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The fallen singer cries out plaintively from the floor.</p>
  <p> SINGER<br>
    Nok'tar be'got, hosh'ar te'not... ?</p>
  <p> The musicians bang and whistle their instruments to<br>
    punctuate his words.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's he saying?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is asking if anyone else will<br>
    have the courage to stand up to<br>
    Molor...</p>
  <p> Worf and Alexander look around at the crowd, but no one<br>
    steps forward.</p>
  <p> SINGER<br>
    Nok'tar be'got... ?</p>
  <p> Suddenly Worf steps forward and grabs the fallen<br>
    singer's BAT'LETH. He sings out at a challenge to<br>
    &quot;Molor&quot; at the top of his lungs --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!</p>
  <p> &quot;Molor&quot; cries out when he sees Worf and springs toward<br>
    him to attack.</p>
  <p> MOLOR<br>
    (a battle cry)<br>
    Ni'tokor bak'to!</p>
  <p> And the two men start to fight -- the movements are not<br>
    choreographed, but they are controlled in that they are<br>
    based on the forms of the mok'bara. As they fight they<br>
    sing out and the crowd cheers them on.</p>
  <p> MOLOR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Ba'jak tu'mo!</p>
  <p> And their bat'leths clang together --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (defiant)<br>
    O'tak tu'ro!</p>
  <p> Alexander watches rapt... behind him, we see the<br>
    strange Klingon, staring intently at Alexander...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> After a few more thrusts and parries, Worf plays his<br>
    part and pretends to be felled -- he sings out the same<br>
    plea as before, wondering who will save them from<br>
    Molor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Nok'tar be'got?</p>
  <p> Molor sings out triumphantly, turns to the crowd, who<br>
    boo and hiss the anti-hero. Worf gives Alexander an<br>
    encouraging look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hosh'ar te'not?</p>
  <p> Alexander considers, then dashes forward and grabs the<br>
    BAT'LETH from the floor. He raises it defiantly toward<br>
    Molor.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Ki'rok Molor, ki'rok!</p>
  <p> Molor turns, and a smile lights up his face when he<br>
    sees his young challenger.</p>
  <p> MOLOR<br>
    What's this... ?</p>
  <p> He steps toward Alexander, weapon raised, and is<br>
    careful to scale down his combat so as not to hurt the<br>
    boy. Worf watches, thrilled as can be.</p>
  <p> Alexander, however, is pumped full of adrenaline -- he<br>
    takes a few wild swings that Molor has to dodge by<br>
    moving fast.</p>
  <p> Then he allows Alexander to make contact with one of<br>
    the blows, and he falls back, feigning injury.</p>
  <p> MOLOR<br>
    Jik'ta! You have wounded me!</p>
  <p> Alexander looks pleased with himself. Worf beams with<br>
    pride.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You fought well.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Alexander smiles, turns back to the opera.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What happens now?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Only one man can stand against<br>
    Molor.</p>
  <p> The crowd cheers because the first singer steps back<br>
    into the square, now wearing a different head-dress<br>
    that indicates he is playing Kahless.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    It's Kahless!</p>
  <p> &quot;Kahless&quot; rears himself up and sings out defiantly --</p>
  <p> SINGER<br>
    Nok'til Kahless. Molor gik'tal!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT ONE 12A.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> The crowd roars their approval.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless would rather die than live<br>
    under Molor's tyranny...</p>
  <p> The two singers start to fight and sing, and the crowd<br>
    watches in rapt attention.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Ni'lot Kahless!</p>
  <p> Worf looks down at his son's wide-eyed face... things<br>
    couldn't be going better...</p>
  <p> TIME CUT:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. KLINGON OUTPOST - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The square is now deserted and dark. We pan across a<br>
    sleeping FIGURE stretched out on a bench, then find<br>
    Worf sitting nearby, waiting impatiently for Alexander.</p>
  <p> After a moment, the boy comes running across the<br>
    square.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Father --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Where have you been?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    We were watching the fire dancers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    K'Nor and Bar'el -- they live here<br>
    on the outpost. I need some<br>
    money.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What for?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    There's a man over there who's got<br>
    Molor's head in a box -- the real<br>
    Molor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is impossible. Molor died<br>
    centuries ago.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I know -- it's mummified. He said<br>
    he'd show it to us for fifty<br>
    darseks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Alexander clearly thinks this is something that should<br>
    not be missed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is trying to take your money.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Please, Father. He's waiting.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. It is late. We should go<br>
    home.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    But --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander.</p>
  <p> Alex hears the finality in Worf's voice and backs off.</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing the Klingon who was staring at them before...<br>
    he's standing in a shadowed doorway, watching them...</p>
  <p>7 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Worf stands and starts to cross away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come, it is time to go.</p>
  <p> Behind them, we see TWO KLINGONS in civilian clothes<br>
    emerge into the square and start to follow them.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I have to say goodbye.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You can see your friends again<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    We're coming back?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you want to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The two Klingons are moving in behind them in a<br>
    menacing way, and a THIRD KLINGON emerges into the<br>
    square in front of them.</p>
  <p> Worf senses something is going on -- he looks at the<br>
    Klingon ahead, then turns to see the other two behind<br>
    them, who have fanned out so as to corral their<br>
    intended victims from three sides.</p>
  <p> When they see Worf has noticed them, the Klingons pull<br>
    elaborately carved DAGGERS from their belts...<br>
    Alexander realizes they're in danger and moves to his<br>
    father's side -- they're surrounded. Off this moment<br>
    we...</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. KLINGON OUTPOST - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf and Alexander surrounded by the three armed<br>
    assailants...</p>
  <p> Suddenly the Klingon who was watching from the shadows,<br>
    K'MTAR, steps into the square and raises a DISRUPTOR.<br>
    He FIRES at one of the attackers, but the shot goes<br>
    wide and hits the far wall. The attackers are<br>
    momentarily taken off-guard, and Worf seizes the moment --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander, run --</p>
  <p> He points Alexander on the safest route and the boy<br>
    scurries past the attackers and away...</p>
  <p> A second attacker lunges toward Worf, who dodges his<br>
    weapon and delivers a kick to his mid-section... the<br>
    third attacker strikes Worf a vicious blow that sends<br>
    him to the floor.</p>
  <p> K'mtar can't risk taking another shot -- everything's<br>
    happening too fast and he might hit Worf, so he rushes<br>
    forward intending to join in the fight.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (a battle cry)<br>
    Ni'tokor bak'to!</p>
  <p> The sound of K'mtar's cry distracts the third attacker<br>
    for the crucial second it takes Worf to recover... he<br>
    gets a leg up and flips him over his prone body -- the<br>
    attacker hits the floor hard and loses his grip on the<br>
    dagger, which goes skittering across the floor.</p>
  <p> Because one of them has lost his weapon, and because an<br>
    armed stranger is coming to the rescue, the three<br>
    attackers beat a retreat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    K'pla, Worf. They were no match<br>
    for us.</p>
  <p> Worf turns to this stranger who knows his name... they<br>
    look at each other, breathing hard...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've seen you somewhere before.<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    A friend...</p>
  <p> K'mtar raises his hand to show a SIGNET RING on his<br>
    finger -- Worf reacts as if he recognizes it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you... K'mtar?</p>
  <p> K'mtar acknowledges.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Your brother sent me here to<br>
    protect you...</p>
  <p> Off this moment we...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> where Riker, Worf and K'mtar have met to discuss what<br>
    happened. The dagger dropped in the attack is on the<br>
    table, wrapped in a soft cloth. K'mtar seems a little<br>
    impatient, as if he wants Riker to leave him and Worf<br>
    alone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gesturing to K'mtar)<br>
    He is gin'tak to the house of<br>
    Mogh...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Gin'tak?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    An advisor so trusted that he is<br>
    made part of a family.</p>
  <p> Riker takes this in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you have any idea who was<br>
    behind the attack?</p>
  <p> K'mtar's attitude toward Riker is blunt to the point of<br>
    being contentious.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It is a Klingon matter. Not your<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> Riker is surprised at the sharpness of his tone, tries<br>
    to be diplomatic but firm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One of my officers was almost<br>
    killed. That makes it my concern.</p>
  <p> K'mtar eyes Riker briefly, then backs off.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Recently rumors began to circulate<br>
    on the homeworld that an<br>
    assassination attempt was going to<br>
    be made against the family of<br>
    Mogh. Kurn sent me to make sure<br>
    nothing happened to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't you warn him before the<br>
    attack was made?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I tried to contact him by<br>
    subspace, but was told Worf wasn't<br>
    aboard. I decided to beam<br>
    directly to the surface.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf unwraps the cloth and reveals the dagger.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    One of the attackers dropped this<br>
    dagger.<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    The design... represents the house<br>
    of Duras.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    We have other evidence that<br>
    indicates the Duras sisters, Lursa<br>
    and B'Etor, were behind the<br>
    attack.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you think they're after?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Kurn's seat on the council, of<br>
    course.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We can not allow their attack on<br>
    our house to go unanswered.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    First we have to find them... and<br>
    they've been elusive.</p>
  <p> Riker considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At one point they were at Deep<br>
    Space Nine, trying to sell<br>
    bilitrium explosives.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    That was months ago. No one knows<br>
    where they went from there.</p>
  <p> Again, K'mtar's tone is sharp, unnecessarily harsh.<br>
    Riker keeps his cool, responds evenly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we can find out.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We've arranged quarters for you,<br>
    if you'd like to stay aboard.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I would. Worf and I have much to<br>
    discuss.</p>
  <p> Riker stands and the meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p>10 OMITTED</p>
  <p>11 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Worf and K'mtar are talking. Worf is annoyed<br>
    with how K'mtar treated Riker, but K'mtar is oblivious.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I'll send Kurn a message telling<br>
    him what happened, but it will be<br>
    days before he receives it -- he's<br>
    gone to the Hitora colony as<br>
    Gowron's representative.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    K'mtar, why did you treat<br>
    Commander Riker so<br>
    disrespectfully?</p>
  <p> K'mtar looks utterly baffled by Worf's statement.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were... rude.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I may have been rude by human<br>
    standards, but I meant no<br>
    disrespect.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR (Cont'd)<br>
    What's the matter Worf, have you<br>
    been living among humans so long<br>
    that you've forgotten how Klingons<br>
    behave?</p>
  <p> Though he says this with a smile, Worf senses something<br>
    more underneath it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have not forgotten... I am<br>
    merely pointing out that their<br>
    ways our different from ours.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I trust you've made your son aware<br>
    of that fact, as well?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts, unsure what K'mtar is implying.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course I have.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Good. Because someday Alexander<br>
    may be called upon to lead the<br>
    house of Mogh. Kurn has no male<br>
    heir, and he wants to be sure that<br>
    Alexander is preparing himself.</p>
  <p> Worf's reaction is a bit defensive.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Does my brother doubt my ability<br>
    to raise my son as a Klingon?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    No. But you are alone among<br>
    humans. It cannot be easy to keep<br>
    our ways.</p>
  <p> This strikes a nerve.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... it has not been easy.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    How are his fighting skills? Can<br>
    he handle a Bat'leth?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT TWO 21A.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is learning... he could be<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    He must be. He's not far from the<br>
    age of ascension.</p>
  <p> Worf is reluctant to admit it, but he feels he must.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Actually... Alexander has not<br>
    committed himself to undergoing<br>
    the rite.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have tried to make him see how<br>
    important it is, but he will not<br>
    listen to me.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Perhaps together, you and I can<br>
    find a way to spark the boy's<br>
    interest in his heritage.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would be grateful for any help<br>
    you could give.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Tomorrow, then.</p>
  <p> K'mtar stands to go, then casts a glance toward the<br>
    bedroom.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    May I say goodnight to him?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Worf and K'mtar cross toward the other room.</p>
  <p>12 INT. BEDROOM</p>
  <p> as K'mtar goes to sit next to Alexander, who's tucked<br>
    in under a blanket. Worf hangs back by the door.<br>
    K'mtar picks up a picture of K'Ehlyer next to the bed.<br>
    His attitude to Alexander is considerably less gruff.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Is this your mother?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    She died when I was little.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You miss her a great deal, don't<br>
    you... ?</p>
  <p> Alexander only nods, but it's clear that he does.<br>
    K'mtar puts the picture back.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It must be hard for you... being<br>
    the only Klingon your age on board<br>
    this ship.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Sometimes...</p>
  <p> Worf is surprised to hear the gentleness in this<br>
    otherwise cantankerous man.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Have you ever been to the<br>
    homeworld?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I think you'd like it there. At<br>
    your uncle's house there is a lake<br>
    where you can swim. The water is<br>
    so clear you can see to the<br>
    bottom.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    And you have cousins there. They<br>
    want to meet you.</p>
  <p> Alexander looks away, troubled by something.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> K'mtar seems to know just what it is -- as though he<br>
    has a line directly into Alexander's heart.</p>

    I understand. You're afraid...<br>
    you don't know if the Home World<br>
    is safe.</p>
  <p> Alexander looks at him, amazed that this gentle man<br>
    seems to know just what he's feeling.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> K'mtar smiles and puts a hand on Alexander's shoulder,<br>
    comforting.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    What happened today... on the<br>
    planet... was frightening.<br>
    You're still troubled...</p>

  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You must have wanted to help us<br>
    fight them off.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I didn't know what to do...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Someday, if you work hard, you'll<br>
    be a warrior... a Klingon warrior,<br>
    and you'll always feel safe<br>
    because you'll know how to defend<br>
    yourself. And do you know what<br>
    else? If anyone ever tries to<br>
    hurt your father again, you'll be<br>
    able to fight at his side and make<br>
    sure nothing happens to him. What<br>
    do you think of that?</p>
  <p> Alexander smiles -- he's struck by this image of<br>
    himself as older and stronger, and comforted by how<br>
    empowered it makes him feel.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Good night, Alexander. Dream<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Good night, K'mtar.</p>
  <p> Alexander turns his face into his pillow and closes his<br>

  <p>13 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker has the Bridge, Worf is at tactical, and various<br>
    N.D.s man the other consoles. Riker approaches Data<br>
    and K'mtar, who are working at an aft science station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any luck?</p>

  <p> Quark tries to gloss over this with a smile.</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    I thought I explained that my<br>

    your bar.</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    I look forward to seeing you upon<br>
    your return...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is that what this is about...<br>
    you're on your way and you're<br>
    calling to reserve a Holosuite<br>
    program... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually, I was hoping you could<br>
    help me with something else.</p>
  <p> K'mtar is listening closely, wondering what Riker is up<br>
    to.</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    What would that be... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm looking for some Klingon<br>
    friends of mine... the Duras<br>
    sisters -- Lursa and B'Etor?</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    Oh, yes... Lursa and B'Etor...<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    Big talk... small tips.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought you might know where<br>
    they went.</p>

  <p> There's a beat as Quark realizes he's got the<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    Me? What makes you think I'd<br>
    know... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander Sisko said if anyone<br>
    would know, you would...</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    He flatters me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well... I did hear a rumor,<br>
    actually...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What kind of rumor?</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    I don't know... I'm sure it was<br>
    told to me in confidence...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And how much is your &quot;confidence&quot;<br>
    worth?</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    How many vouchers do you have,<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enough for twelve bars of latinum.</p>
  <p> There is a heavy silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll be glad to return them.</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    Ah. I believe the rumor was...<br>
    that the sisters were trying to<br>
    buy some second-hand mining<br>
    equipment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What for?</p>

  <p> QUARK<br>
    They learned of a magnesite<br>
    deposit in the Kalla system... it<br>
    belongs to the Pakleds, but those<br>
    fools don't even know it's there.<br>
    Your friends were trying to get at<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Riker takes this in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'll send you those vouchers...</p>
  <p> QUARK<br>
    Don't bother... I voided them<br>
    while we've been talking.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So long, Quark...</p>
  <p> And the VIEWSCREEN returns to a starfield.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long would it take us to reach<br>
    the Kalla system?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Approximately sixteen hours.</p>
  <p> When he hears Riker's intent K'mtar steps forward and<br>
    questions Quark's assertion.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Couldn't he have been lying?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why would he? I'd just end up<br>
    knocking on his door again in a<br>
    few days -- and I wouldn't be in<br>
    as good a mood.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    I congratulate you, Commander. I<br>
    didn't think it would be possible<br>
    to find the sisters.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to the con officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take us out of orbit.</p>
  <p> Off K'mtar's face... he seems to be eager for the hunt.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>14 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Worf, K'mtar and Alexander make their way down it.<br>
    Father and son are in work-out clothes, K'mtar in<br>
    battle gear -- he has a knife in his belt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Today we will work on the<br>
    Koh'manara block... it is a<br>
    combination of the koh'bala pivot<br>
    and the pak'ara thrust -- the<br>
    forms I taught you last week.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes, Father...</p>
  <p> Worf sees that the boy is holding his bat'leth somewhat<br>
    carelessly, so that its point is dragging behind him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander, have I not taught you<br>
    to treat your sword with respect?</p>
  <p> Alexander frowns and takes a new hold of the bat'leth.<br>
    K'mtar studies Alexander's face for a beat as they<br>
    continue on.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You're not looking forward to<br>
    training, are you?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Not really...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It can be boring repeating the<br>
    same moves over and over again.</p>
  <p> Alexander's reaction indicates that he agrees<br>
    wholeheartedly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must master the forms before<br>
    you can apply them.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    That's true, but I was thinking we<br>
    might try something different<br>
    today.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him -- what's he up to?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - 01/28/94 - ACT THREE 27A.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I took the liberty of creating a<br>
    Holodeck program.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What kind of program?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I'll show you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>15 ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they approach a Holodeck door.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Computer... run program K'mtar<br>
    alpha-one.</p>
  <p> After a moment.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Program initiated. Enter when<br>
    ready.</p>
  <p> They move to the door, which OPENS onto --</p>
  <p>16 EXT. KLINGON OUTPOST - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which is now deserted. They ENTER, and cross into the<br>
    center of the square.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why did you want to recreate this?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You said you wished you'd been<br>
    able to help your father fight,<br>
    but you didn't know how...</p>
  <p> Alexander acknowledges --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You've probably thought about the<br>
    attack over and over again.</p>
  <p> Alexander looks up at him, wondering how he knows this --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Then let's see what happens this<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> He hands Worf his knife.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Computer, give us two Klingon<br>
    warriors.</p>
  <p> Suddenly TWO KLINGON WARRIORS MATERIALIZE near Worf and<br>
    Alexander, wearing full battle-gear and carrying<br>
    bat'leths (and/or knives).</p>
  <p> Alexander stares at the two burly Klingons.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    How can I fight somebody that big?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It is not size that matters.<br>
    Cunning... skill... and<br>
    observation are the most important<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> He turns toward the warriors.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing, a battle<br>
    cry)<br>
    Ni'tokor bak'to!</p>
  <p> Father and son engage their adversaries as K'mtar<br>
    watches. Worf dispatches his, and after Alexander<br>
    fights for a few more beats --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> Alexander's adversary FREEZES in mid-battle. K'mtar<br>
    indicates the figure Alexander was fighting.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Look what this ko'tal is doing.<br>
    See his legs, they give a clue to<br>
    what his next move will be.</p>
  <p> Alexander studies the figure for a beat.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    His weight is all on his right<br>
    foot.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, he's going to have to shift<br>
    it to regain his balance.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 29A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>

    Computer, resume program.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> The figure REANIMATES, and pivots just as predicted --<br>
    Alexander is ready for him, and is able to knock him to<br>
    the ground.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Po'tajg! (well done)</p>
  <p> Alexander smiles proudly. He's standing over his<br>
    adversary, who's laid flat on his back, defenseless.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Finish him.</p>
  <p> Alexander's features change when he hears this -- he<br>
    looks down at the defenseless man, who's looking up at<br>
    him, his eyes wide with dread.</p>
  <p> Alexander can't bring himself to do it... he looks up<br>
    at K'mtar, then Worf -- much to their dismay, he throws<br>
    his bat'leth aside.</p>
  <p> With a guttural cry the Holodeck figure suddenly leaps<br>
    to his feet and grabs the knife from his belt -- he's<br>
    going for Alexander...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> The figure FREEZES, his knife caught in mid-slash<br>
    toward Alexander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You should have killed him when<br>
    you had the chance.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Why didn't you?</p>
  <p> Alexander is clearly distraught over what's happened --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I... I don't know...</p>
  <p> The boy's response angers K'mtar -- he indicates the<br>
    holofigure.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Look at him! He didn't care that<br>
    you showed him mercy. He was<br>
    going to kill you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 30A.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Alexander looks to his father; K'mtar's anger is<br>
    scaring him. Worf can't help but intercede on his<br>
    son's behalf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    K'mtar... enough.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    If this were real he'd be dead<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Alexander's had enough -- he turns and runs toward the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander --</p>
  <p> But he ignores him and EXITS. Worf and K'mtar turn to<br>
    each other... their shared hope of turning Alexander<br>
    into a warrior seems more remote than ever...</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>18 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data has the Bridge, Worf is at tactical, various N.D.s<br>
    as needed. Riker ENTERS from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are approaching Kalla Three.</p>
  <p> Data takes the Ops position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Assume a standard orbit.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Any evidence of a mining<br>
    operation?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    A shaft has been cut through the<br>
    outer crust... there is evidence<br>
    of machinery, but it does not<br>
    appear to be in use.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is difficult to say. The<br>
    magnesite is interfering with bioreadings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Assemble an Away Team.</p>
  <p> Data gestures to Worf, and they head for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>19 INT. THE MINES</p>
  <p> where Geordi, Data, Worf and an N.D. SECURITY OFFICER<br>
    are moving through an underground TUNNEL. They carry<br>
    PALM BEACONS and PHASERS.</p>
  <p> They see that there is a larger area up ahead, and that<br>
    it's ILLUMINATED by some light source. There are<br>
    SOUNDS of activity; a person moving around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They take a moment to prepare, then step out into this<br>
    open area, their weapons raised.</p>
  <p>20 OMITTED</p>
  <p>21 INT. A ROCKY PIT</p>
  <p> as they react to what they see -- a lone DOPTERIAN --<br>
    GORTA, sitting on a crate, morosely eating out of a<br>
    can. He turns at the sound of their entrance, a look<br>
    of surprise on his face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> It takes the Ferengi a moment to recover from his<br>
    shock.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Gorta... I'm Gorta...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you doing on this planet?</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    (evasive)<br>
    I... crashed here.</p>
  <p> Riker fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf exchange a skeptical look. Data gives<br>
    no indication that he doesn't believe him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then you are denying involvement<br>
    in illegal mining activities.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    (as if he's realizing<br>
    only now)<br>
    Mining? So that's what all this<br>
    equipment is for...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suspect that you are feigning<br>
    ignorance.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    What a thing to say.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are looking for two Klingon<br>
    women, sisters --</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Lursa! B'Etor? Do you know where<br>
    they are?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Actually we were hoping you did.</p>
  <p> Gorta pulls back, sensing he might be able to cut a<br>
    deal.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Maybe I do...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you be willing to share your<br>
    information with us?</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    My personal code of conduct<br>
    prohibits sharing. But I'd<br>
    consider a trade...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Does your personal code of conduct<br>
    tell you that when you're stranded<br>
    on a planet with no way off, you<br>
    shouldn't try to cut deals?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT THREE 33A.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    You have a point.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We could certainly provide you<br>
    with passage off this planet in<br>
    exchange for information.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Could you perhaps... fail to tell<br>
    the Pakleds that we were mining<br>
    their ore?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't push your luck.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if you can get us to the Duras<br>
    sisters, I'll see what I can do.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    The Duras sisters... they are<br>
    magnificent, aren't they?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Where are they now?</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Selling the ore, I imagine. They<br>
    took everything, the ore, the<br>
    ship...<br>
    (with admiration)<br>
    Such treachery... I can't help but<br>
    adore them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What kind of ship do they have?</p>

  <p> GORTA<br>
    A Bird of Prey. With a working<br>
    cloaking device. Who knows how<br>
    they got hold of that...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And where have they gone?</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    We were going to sell the ore to<br>
    a Yridian trader. We were<br>
    supposed to meet him in the Ufandi<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Gather your belongings. It is<br>
    time to leave.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi tosses the can over his shoulder and<br>
    indicates he's ready.</p>
  <p> GORTA<br>
    Like I said... they took<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> Off this moment...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>22 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> where Worf is sitting at the bar, alone. The usual<br>
    compliment of N.D.s. After a moment, K'mtar approaches<br>
    him -- he's had time to think about what happened.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges with a small nod.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry about what happened. I<br>
    shouldn't have gotten so angry.<br>
    It's just that... I'm worried<br>
    about Alexander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    As am I.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Kurn told me that his mother<br>
    actively discouraged him from<br>
    exploring his Klingon heritage...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When he came to live with me, he<br>
    knew nothing of our ways.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He often reminds me of things his<br>
    mother said to him... I try not to<br>
    disregard her wishes, I want him<br>
    to honor her memory...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 35A.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> There is a beat as K'mtar regards Worf, seems to<br>
    struggle to find the right way to say something.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Someday... I'm sure he'll<br>
    appreciate you. And be grateful<br>
    for all you've given him.</p>
  <p> Worf appreciates the statement. K'mtar takes a breath,<br>
    must raise a difficult issue.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Still, compared to other boys his<br>
    age, Alexander's fighting skills<br>
    are years behind.</p>
  <p> Worf knows it's true.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I know. He has not put in the<br>
    time he needs to learn the skills.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I think you should consider<br>
    sending him to the training<br>
    Academy on Ogat. Your brother is<br>
    an influential man; he could see<br>
    to it that Alexander was admitted.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Send him... to Ogat?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm only thinking of what's best<br>
    for him. At the Academy he'd<br>
    learn our ways, he'd live like a<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I want him to learn our ways,<br>
    but... this is his home.</p>
  <p> K'mtar keeps at it.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    How can you expect him to lead our<br>
    house someday when all he's known<br>
    is life aboard a Federation<br>
    starship?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is my son; he belongs with me.</p>
  <p> K'mtar loses his temper --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    The boy is more human than<br>
    Klingon. If he stays here, he'll<br>
    never be a warrior. He'll never<br>
    be able to defend our family<br>
    against its enemies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enough... the decision is mine.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Not necessarily. It would be<br>
    within my rights to invoke ya'nora<br>
    kor.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You would challenge my fitness to<br>
    raise my own son?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    For the good of our house, yes.</p>
  <p> There is a brief second as the men hold eyes...<br>
    K'mtar's plea to Worf seems an urgency that's born of<br>
    pain -- an anguish that comes from deep within.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Worf... I beg you... stop thinking<br>
    of yourself. It's Alexander we<br>
    must consider.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Look into your heart... and do<br>
    what's best for him.</p>
  <p> And with that K'mtar turns and EXITS Ten Forward,<br>
    leaving Worf angry and troubled...</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>23 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Worf has just told Troi everything.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    -- if K'mtar invoked ya'nora kor,<br>
    your vote would cancel his, and it<br>
    would be up to your brother to<br>
    decide who would get custody of<br>
    Alexander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am confident my brother would<br>
    not vote against me.</p>
  <p> But his voice betrays some doubt.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You don't sound confident...</p>
  <p> Worf's face tells her she's right... he considers for<br>
    a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps I should let Alexander<br>
    know what is at stake... it might<br>
    induce him to spend more time<br>
    training.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure that's a good idea...<br>
    it might scare him.</p>
  <p> Worf feels frustrated, that it's too late to change his<br>
    son.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I should have tried harder... I<br>
    should have taken him to visit the<br>
    homeworld...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... Alexander is part human,<br>
    and that part of him is every bit<br>
    as important as his Klingon side.<br>
    I think you've done a wonderful<br>
    job of exposing him to both sides<br>
    of his heritage.</p>
  <p> Worf appreciates what she's saying, but is still<br>
    troubled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But by doing that, I may have made<br>
    it impossible for him to be<br>
    accepted as a true Klingon.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There are those who'd say you're<br>
    not a true Klingon, just because<br>
    you wear that uniform.</p>
  <p> Worf bristles... but he knows it's true.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The truth is you've found a<br>
    balance within yourself, a balance<br>
    that feels right to you. You have<br>
    to trust that Alexander will be<br>
    able to find his own balance.<br>
    Just as you did.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf takes this in...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Part of me wants to give him that<br>
    freedom... but what if he turns<br>
    away from his Klingon heritage?<br>
    What will happen to my father's<br>
    house? Who will lead it?</p>
  <p> Troi has no answer for him... off Worf's dilemma...</p>
  <p>24 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Alexander is listening to K'mtar recount an<br>
    ancient Klingon story.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    -- Kahless was determined to teach<br>
    his brother a lesson for having<br>
    told a lie, but Morath refused to<br>
    fight his brother, and instead ran<br>
    away. Kahless pursued him across<br>
    valleys and over mountains, all<br>
    the way to the edge of the sea.<br>
    And there on the shore, they<br>
    fought for --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Twelve days and twelve nights. I<br>
    know, I've heard this story<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> Alexander isn't being dismissive, it's just that he<br>
    wants to ask a question about the story before K'mtar<br>
    moves on.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Alexander, it is important to tell<br>
    these stories, even if we already<br>
    know them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Why was Kahless so mad about the<br>
    lie his brother told?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Because it made him look like a<br>
    coward.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    If Kahless had just let him<br>
    explain what happened, maybe they<br>
    wouldn't have had to fight about<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You are missing the point --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    And I don't see what's so wrong<br>
    with running away -- maybe Morath<br>
    didn't want to fight his brother<br>
    because he didn't want to have to<br>
    kill him.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    He ran because he was a coward --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    How do you know that's why?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (firm)<br>
    No more questions! These are our<br>
    stories. A warrior must learn how<br>
    to interpret them properly.</p>
  <p> Alexander bristles at being shut down like this.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm trying to --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    No, your head is full of foolish<br>
    human notions about the way things<br>
    are. You are Klingon. You must<br>
    begin to act like one.</p>
  <p> Alexander stands up for himself.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm part human, too.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Listen to me, Alexander... when a<br>
    human looks at you, he doesn't see<br>
    himself, he sees a Klingon.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    It doesn't matter what I look<br>
    like.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It does. You're different from<br>
    everyone aboard this ship. And no<br>
    matter how much people pretend<br>
    otherwise, they'll always see you<br>
    as different.</p>
  <p> K'mtar is playing on that most basic of childhood fears --<br>
    the fear of being different from others, of sticking<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    That's not true...</p>
  <p> Alexander doesn't want to believe him, but it's clear<br>
    that K'mtar's words are making him feel unsure about<br>
    himself...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FOUR 42A.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    It is. The only way you'll ever<br>
    feel like you really belong, is if<br>
    you leave here and go live with<br>
    your own kind.</p>
  <p> K'mtar sees that he's getting to him --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know a Klingon school you could<br>
    go to; you'd be welcome there.<br>
    They'd teach you how to be a<br>
    warrior -- prepare you for the<br>
    Rite of Ascension.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I don't know if I want to do<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> There's an edge of desperation in K'mtar's voice; he<br>
    feels like he's hooked Alexander, and now has to reel<br>
    him in.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    After you've been there a while...<br>
    you'll find you won't want to do<br>
    anything else.</p>
  <p> But Alexander manages to shake off his doubts --</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    But I don't want to leave the<br>
    Enterprise --</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You must! Everything depends on<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I thought you were different. I<br>
    thought you understood me. But<br>
    you don't. You're just like my<br>
    Father. All you care about is me<br>
    becoming a warrior. Why don't you<br>
    just leave me alone!</p>
  <p> And with that he turns and runs out the door... the<br>
    anger and frustration drains from K'mtar's face, and<br>
    something else bleeds in -- a look of profound loss...<br>
    He buries his face in his hands...</p>

    have already been here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Somehow I doubt the Yridians are<br>
    going to be very forthcoming about<br>
    where they might have gone...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Sir, readings indicate that there<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    There should be over ten thousand<br>
    kilograms...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's odd...<br>

    Hail them.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console and a YRIDIAN -- YOG -- appears<br>
    on the VIEWSCREEN.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I'm Commander Riker of the<br>
    Federation Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    I am Yog... why are we speaking?</p>
  <p> Yog's syntax can be a little odd.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our sensors indicate you're<br>
    carrying magnesite ore...</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    Magnesite, yes.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where did you get it?</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    From a Corvallen. For a good<br>
    price.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Troi, who gives a small shake of her<br>
    head to indicate she doesn't believe him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where's this... Corvallen now? I<br>
    have orders to acquire some<br>
    magnesite.</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    He is gone...<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    Where? I don't know.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wouldn't you be interested in<br>
    selling me the ore you're<br>
    carrying?</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi exchange a look -- what is Riker up to?</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    No, I have a buyer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You haven't heard my offer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Half a gram of Anjoran bio-mimetic<br>
    gel.</p>
  <p> The Yridians eyes widen -- this is clearly an<br>
    outrageous offer.</p>
  <p> YRIDIAN<br>
    Done.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Once we've verified the ore's<br>
    purity, we'll beam over the gel.</p>
  <p> Riker starts to cross back toward his chair. The<br>
    Yridian's face DISAPPEARS from the VIEWSCREEN, replaced<br>
    by a shot of the freighter.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're up to something...</p>
  <p> But Riker doesn't answer. He starts inputting<br>
    something into his chair's control panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have the Transporter Room beam the<br>
    ore to these coordinates.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir, that would place the ore<br>
    directly off the ship's starboard<br>
    bow.</p>

    I know.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    visible against the shimmer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Bird of Prey...</p>
  <p> When the explosion dissipates seconds later, the ship<br>
    disappears because it is cloaked.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Put a tractor beam on it.</p>
  <p> Worf complies. Data and Troi exchange a look --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How did you know?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Yridians had only part of the<br>
    shipment in their hold -- I<br>
    realized we must've arrived before<br>
    they had the chance to transfer<br>
    the rest.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think so.</p>

  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    What assassination attempt? This<br>
    is the first I've heard of it.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    (hopeful)<br>
    Did it succeed?</p>
  <p> Lursa barks a laugh, and B'Etor joins in with her own<br>
    grating squawk.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have evidence that you were<br>
    behind it.</p>
  <p> LURSA<br>
    That is outrageous.</p>
  <p> B'ETOR<br>
    What is this evidence?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beam over and we'll show you.</p>
  <p> The sisters exchange a glance.</p>

    The sisters refuse to sit, preferring to pace around<br>
    and slam their hands on the table for emphasis. Worf<br>
    places the wrapped dagger on the table in front of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This was dropped by one of the<br>

    wants to do, but something he feels he has to do. He<br>
    steps toward him...</p>

    corridor. He sees that K'mtar has a weapon and,<br>
    without hesitation, rushes forward and grabs hold of<br>
    him, pulling him out of the doorway and into the main<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> (NOTE: the door to Alexander's room should shut when<br>
    he's pulled away.)</p>
  <p> Worf struggles with K'mtar, trying to get the disruptor<br>
    away from him. But K'mtar, adrenalin-filled, resists.<br>
    Finally Worf slams his fist against K'mtar's weapon arm<br>
    and the disruptor goes skittering across the floor.</p>
  <p> Worf's momentum takes him away from the direction of<br>
    the disruptor; K'mtar runs for it, grabs it, and whirls<br>
    to face Worf, charging hard at him. He points the<br>
    disruptor right at Worf.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    No further.</p>
  <p> Worf stops, sees the determination in K'mtar's face.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    K'mtar... why are you doing this?</p>
  <p> K'mtar gestures with the disruptor for Worf to step out<br>
    from in front of Alexander's door.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Step away from the door.</p>
  <p> But Worf isn't moving.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will have to kill me.</p>
  <p> K'mtar stares at him, anguish on his face.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I won't do that. But I can stun<br>
    you -- then kill the boy.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I... am Alexander.</p>
  <p> Off this shocking revelation...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>32 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Worf stares at him in disbelief...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What... are you saying?</p>
  <p> K'mtar is weak... holding his damaged throat... gasping<br>
    for air...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I... am your son... Alexander...<br>
    I have come to this time from<br>
    forty years in the future.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at him, then seizes him once more by the<br>
    shoulders, shaking him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    P'tak! Tell me the truth or I<br>
    will kill you.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Look at me!</p>
  <p> Still holding him by the shoulders, Worf stares at the<br>
    man, deep into his eyes.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You said when you first met me<br>
    that I looked familiar.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I could have seen you on the<br>
    Homeworld...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    No. Look closely. I am your son.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at him, still doubtful... yet, seeing<br>
    something in the man's eyes. And, after all, Worf<br>
    knows that time travel is possible.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you are Alexander... you will<br>
    remember the final words your<br>
    mother said as she died.</p>
  <p> K'mtar fixes him with a steely look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I was three years old. She was<br>
    dying when we found her. She<br>
    barely managed to whisper my<br>
    name... and she took my hand...<br>
    and placed it in yours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Then she died. You howled with<br>
    rage... and then you told me to<br>
    look at her... to look at death...<br>
    and always to remember.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I always have.</p>
  <p> These are details Worf has never shared with anyone.<br>
    This must be Alexander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How... have you done this? Come<br>
    to this time?</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    Forty years from now the ways are<br>
    well known. But few are willing<br>
    to risk the dangers.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I decided I must take the risk.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And you did it... in order to end<br>
    your own life?</p>
  <p> K'mtar is so overwhelmed with emotion that it's hard<br>
    for him to speak...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I was hoping I wouldn't have to...<br>
    that I could change things, change<br>
    myself. But I couldn't.<br>
    Everything's going to turn out the<br>
    way it did before. And I can't<br>
    let that happen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE 54B.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why? What is going to happen that<br>
    is so terrible?</p>
  <p> K'mtar looks at his father, roiled by emotion.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You will be killed. Because I was<br>
    naive... too weak... to be able to<br>
    protect you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't believe that...</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I was there! I saw you<br>
    murdered... and I was to blame.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf can't help but have a visceral reaction to the<br>
    news of his own death, but he pushes it aside -- what's<br>
    happened to Alexander is more important to him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You mustn't blame yourself.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    You don't understand -- I never<br>
    became a warrior! I became a<br>
    diplomat... a &quot;peacemaker.&quot;</p>
  <p> His voice is full of disdain.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When the time came for me to lead<br>
    our family -- I thought I could<br>
    single-handedly put an end to the<br>
    fighting between the great<br>
    houses... I declared publicly<br>
    that the house of Mogh would take<br>
    the first step to end the feuding.<br>
    There would be no more<br>
    retribution, no more revenge.</p>
  <p> He looks at his father, pain in his eyes.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You tried to warn me... you tried<br>
    to tell me that I mustn't show<br>
    weakness... but I thought you<br>
    were a foolish old man. I told<br>
    you that you were a relic of an<br>
    earlier time, and that a new era<br>
    of peace was at hand.</p>
  <p> He looks down, ashamed.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But you were right. My enemies<br>
    saw my weakness... and they moved<br>
    against me.</p>
  <p> He looks up at his father, tears in his eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Unless I stop it all now...<br>
    (gestures to door)<br>
    -- that boy will see his father<br>
    killed on the floor of the Council<br>
    Chamber.</p>
  <p> Worf tries to make sense of it all.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That's why you wanted to take<br>
    Alexander away. To turn him into<br>
    a warrior, not a peacemaker.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I staged the assassination attempt<br>
    to frighten him... make him<br>
    realize he must learn the ways of<br>
    a warrior.</p>
  <p> Worf turns away, hearing the familiarity of those<br>
    words.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If I had listened to you... if I<br>
    had become the warrior you<br>
    wanted... you would not have died<br>
    in my arms.</p>
  <p> Worf reaches out, touches the shoulder of his son...<br>
    his son who is older than he is, now. He is struggling<br>
    to come to some resolution of his own ideals, hoping to<br>
    communicate to Alexander a truth that will soothe him.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Who is to say what the future will<br>
    be now, after you have disrupted<br>
    time? I may die tomorrow... or I<br>
    may outlive you.</p>
  <p> He hesitates, looking for the words to reach his son.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But when I die... I would like an<br>
    honorable death. And the only way<br>
    that is possible -- is for you<br>
    accept yourself, as you are, and<br>
    stay true to what you believe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> K'mtar listens carefully.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The cause of peace is a worthy<br>
    one... go back, and continue to<br>
    work for it. Your struggle must<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    But it is a futile struggle...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... you've already changed<br>
    things more than you realize.</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    The boy I was has not changed...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/01/94 - ACT FIVE 57-57A </p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'm talking about myself.</p>
  <p> K'mtar studies his father's face.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have given me a glimpse into<br>
    my son's future. I see now that<br>
    he has his own destiny... and I<br>
    believe it will be a great one...</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long moment... then move<br>
    into each other's arms and embrace...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 01/31/94 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (7)</p>
  <p> K'MTAR<br>
    I love you, Father...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And I you, Alexander...</p>
  <p> Off this moment...</p>
  <p>33 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>34 EXT. HOLODECK/KLINGON OUTPOST - DAY</p>
  <p> as Worf ENTERS from the corridor to find Alexander in<br>
    the town square, practicing moves with his BAT'LETH.<br>
    He turns when he sees his father.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I've been waiting -- where's<br>
    K'mtar?</p>
  <p> Worf approaches his son...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He had to leave... he was called<br>
    away...</p>
  <p> Alexander is visibly disappointed.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    He never said goodbye.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He asked me to say goodbye for<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Firstborn&quot; - REV. 02/02/94 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf squats down so that his eyes are level with<br>
    Alexander's.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He wanted me to tell you that no<br>
    matter what happens, no matter<br>
    what you decide to do with your<br>
    life, he'll always care about you<br>
    a great deal.</p>
  <p> Alexander takes this in...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    When will I see him again?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It may be a long time...</p>
  <p> Alexander is disappointed to hear this, but tries to<br>
    take it well...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    We should start practice...</p>
  <p> He moves to pick up his BAT'LETH...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander... there will be plenty<br>
    of time for training. Why don't<br>
    we... just spend some time<br>
    together?</p>
  <p> Alexander is a little surprised to hear his father say<br>
    this, but pleased... as they start to cross away, Worf<br>
    puts an arm around his son's shoulder. Off this moment<br>
    we...</p>
