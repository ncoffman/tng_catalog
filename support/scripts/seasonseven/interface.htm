    &quot;Interface&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> GEORDI is rushing up a ladder in the tube. The RED<br>
    ALERT CLAXON is sounding around him -- this is clearly<br>
    an emergency. He is wearing his Starfleet uniform, but<br>
    not his VISOR; his eyes are not clouded and his temple<br>
    inputs aren't in place.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Geordi... Have you found it yet?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet...</p>
  <p> He reaches a point where tendrils of SMOKE start to<br>
    appear from up ahead.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Starting to get fumes... Ammonia,<br>
    fluorine, potassium cyanide...</p>
  <p> Geordi continues through the smoke -- starts COUGHING.</p>
  <p>2 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Close on Riker's face as he reacts with concern to<br>
    Geordi's cough.</p>
  <p>3 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi stops coughing, continues climbing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can feel the heat from here.</p>
  <p> He reaches a horizontal juncture and sees the fire down<br>
    the tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There it is!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He enters the horizontal tube and starts toward the<br>
    fire.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    How far?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    About ten meters. Along the ODN<br>
    line. It's hot -- over two<br>
    thousand degrees.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm going in.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Geordi, wait.</p>
  <p> Incredibly, Geordi goes RIGHT INTO THE BLAZE; he<br>
    crosses to a panel and works some controls. We watch<br>
    for several incredible seconds as Geordi works,<br>
    seemingly impervious to the violent flames...</p>
  <p> He trips a control and a plume of gas erupts, putting<br>
    out the fire.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're okay... I've activated the<br>
    emergency supression system.</p>
  <p> The walls of the room are streaked with black.</p>
  <p>4 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's under control.</p>
  <p> Geordi is hooked up to a complex INTERFACE UNIT, a<br>
    sleek headpiece that connects to his VISOR terminals..<br>
    He is wearing a body-suit, with a half-dozen blinking<br>
    nodes at points that correspond to his meridians.<br>
    There is a complex control and monitoring console<br>
    several feet away.</p>
  <p> DATA is monitoring the interface unit on Geordi's body;<br>
    BEVERLY is studying the console; RIKER is standing by,<br>
    watching Geordi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off console)<br>
    All his vital functions are<br>
    completely normal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The interface unit is operating<br>
    within expected parameters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why did he start coughing when he<br>
    went through the gasses?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Psychosomatic response.</p>
  <p> When Geordi speaks, he obviously can't see his<br>
    colleagues, since his eyes are covered. So his voice<br>
    has a certain removed quality, as if talking to them<br>
    from a distance.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I feel like I'm actually here...<br>
    I mean there -- in the Jefferies<br>
    tube. I saw the smoke and I<br>
    couldn't help coughing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No one else has reported so<br>
    complete a sensory experience.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The interface is perfect for<br>
    Geordi because his VISOR inputs<br>
    allow the probe to transmit<br>
    information directly into his<br>
    cerebral cortex.</p>
  <p> Riker nods his understanding.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It looks like this is going to<br>
    work. Let's get the probe out of<br>
    the Jefferies tube and into the<br>
    launch bay before we reach Marijne<br>
    Seven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Will do...</p>
  <p>5 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi goes to start down the tube ladder, but he has<br>
    trouble placing his foot on the lower rung.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something's wrong. I'm having<br>
    trouble controlling my left leg.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi's left thigh appears to be twitching slightly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> Beverly is studying the interface monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The probe is designed to respond<br>
    to the movements Geordi intends to<br>
    make -- when his brain sends a<br>
    message to move his leg, the<br>
    interface moves the probe instead.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently the gain on the tactile<br>
    sensors is too low; I will<br>
    increase the input.</p>
  <p> Data makes an adjustment and Geordi's leg stops<br>
    twitching.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There it goes.</p>
  <p>7 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi successfully plants his left foot in the ladder<br>
    rung and starts down the tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm on my way down.</p>
  <p>7A INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker is eyeing the apparatus.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why the body-suit?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It provides tactile sensations so<br>
    that Geordi will feel as if he is<br>
    in the same environment as the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>7B INT. ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> as Geordi leaves the Jefferies tube and crosses past<br>
    the pool table, he sees something offscreen that<br>
    startles him.</p>
  <p>8 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi has the same startled look on his face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles, relaxes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>9 INT. ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi is looking at &quot;his&quot; reflection in a glass panel --<br>
    only it's not him looking back. He sees THE PROBE --<br>
    a two-foot long metallic CYLINDER. Tiny force beams --<br>
    like pencil-thin needles of light -- project constantly<br>
    from its surface, sweeping over everything around it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I just saw my reflection in a<br>
    panel.<br>
    (wry)<br>
    I forgot what a handsome guy I am.</p>
  <p> Off Geordi's smile...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>10 EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit above a huge, greenish, Neptune-like planet.<br>
    The swirling, violent quality of its atmosphere can be<br>
    seen even from here.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47215.5.<br>
    We are responding to a distress<br>
    call from the science vessel<br>
    Raman, which is apparently trapped<br>
    inside the turbulent atmosphere of<br>
    an unusual gas giant planet. We<br>
    will use an experimental interface<br>
    probe in our attempt to rescue it.</p>
  <p>11 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf and the CON officer are at their posts.</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room and heads for the aft<br>
    science station where Riker, Data and Geordi are<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> They're looking at an OKUDAGRAM that shows a cross-section<br>
    of the atmospheric layers of the planet. The<br>
    science ship is marked in one of the middle layers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have reviewed the vessel's<br>
    mission plans. The Raman was to<br>
    descend to the lower atmosphere,<br>
    eleven thousand kilometers below<br>
    its current position...</p>
  <p> Data indicates two atmospheric layers deeper.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The crew was to sample the<br>
    atmosphere at that level, and then<br>
    return to a safer orbit.</p>
  <p> Data indicates a position much higher than the ship's<br>
    present location.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something must have happened down<br>
    there. Maybe the shields failed,<br>
    or they had an inversion reaction<br>
    in the nacelles.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any life signs?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Our bio-sensors are useless --<br>
    there's too much interference in<br>
    the atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The crew might still be alive.<br>
    But we'll never be able to tell<br>
    from up here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will the probe be able to transmit<br>
    through the interference?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The probe sends information via a<br>
    focused particle beam that should<br>
    be able to cut through the<br>
    interference.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But we may have to operate the<br>
    interface at near tolerance<br>
    levels.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will your nervous system be able<br>
    to handle that much sensory input?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We've tested the interface at up<br>
    to seventy percent of tolerance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There shouldn't be a problem going<br>
    higher -- the safety override will<br>
    kick in at ninety-eight percent<br>
    tolerance and disengage the<br>
    interface.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12 INCLUDE WORF</p>
  <p> as he glances up from his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am receiving a<br>
    transmission from Starfleet<br>
    Command -- Admiral Holt.</p>
  <p> Picard looks up at Worf, a little surprised at the<br>
    message.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, turns back to the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The seven people on that ship are<br>
    our first priority. Is the probe<br>
    ready for launch?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Send it directly to the aft<br>
    section of the Raman, through the<br>
    secondary air lock. That'll put<br>
    it one bulkhead away from the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll interface with the probe as<br>
    soon as it's in place and take it<br>
    in the rest of the way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Riker stays at the console, Geordi and Data start for<br>
    the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 FOLLOW PICARD</p>
  <p> as he crosses the Bridge and goes into the Ready Room.</p>
  <p>14 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard steps around to the monitor on his desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Onscreen.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT appears on the small screen. Picard<br>
    smiles -- they are on familiar terms.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello, Marcus.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> The Admiral returns the smile, but it's a little<br>
    forced.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How's life on DS-Three?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    We're hosting this year's palio.<br>
    The Ferengi have already been<br>
    accused of trying to bribe the<br>
    Breen pilot into throwing the<br>
    race...</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing unusual about that.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Nothing at all...</p>
  <p> A beat. The Admiral's face becomes serious.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I wish I could say I was just<br>
    calling to catch up on things.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Nine days ago, the Hera left here<br>
    on a routine courier mission. We<br>
    were in contact with them for five<br>
    of those days. Then the ship<br>
    disappeared without a trace.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard reacts strongly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Hera?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    I'm afraid so.</p>
  <p> A long silent beat.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HOLT<br>
    The Excelsior and the Noble have<br>
    spent the last seventy-two hours<br>
    retracing its course. Nothing.<br>
    I'm going to keep them at it for<br>
    seventy-two more.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But to be honest, I don't think<br>
    another week would make any<br>
    difference.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Another long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll tell Commander La Forge...</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's grim face.</p>
  <p>15 INT. LAB</p>
  <p> Geordi is fiddling with the interface console as Data<br>
    is applying a pen-like instrument to the interface<br>
    unit, checking everything out.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Picard steps over to where the pair<br>
    is working.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, I need a word with<br>
    Commander La Forge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Sir.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    I will be on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Picard waits for Data to go out the door, then turns<br>
    back to Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've just spoken to Starfleet.<br>
    (gently)<br>
    The Hera is missing.</p>
  <p> Geordi is stunned.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Missing... ?</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Geordi then asks the question to which he<br>
    already seems to know the answer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What about my mother... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain La Forge has disappeared<br>
    along with the rest of her crew...</p>
  <p> Geordi nods. OFF his grave expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi is watching a message on the monitor from<br>
    CAPTAIN SILVA LA FORGE, Geordi's mother. She is<br>
    dressed in a red Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    -- I saw your father last week and<br>
    your sister about ten days before<br>
    that. I decided I missed my<br>
    favorite son...</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles sadly at the inside joke.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (quietly to himself)<br>
    Your only son, Mom...</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're going to have to see the<br>
    Hera again. We've got a lot of<br>
    new faces on board. Including a<br>
    chief engineer who juices up the<br>
    nacelles every chance she gets.<br>
    I think she's the best technician<br>
    in the fleet.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Okay, second best.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles to himself. The door suddenly CHIMES.<br>
    Geordi touches a control and FREEZES the recording of<br>
    his mother.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come in...</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker steps inside the room. He<br>
    pauses when he sees the still frame of Geordi's mother<br>
    on the monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I didn't mean to interrupt.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't worry about it.</p>
  <p> Geordi touches the console and the message continues.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 13.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    Maybe you should meet her. We're<br>
    going to be in the same sector<br>
    next week. Take a shuttle over<br>
    and I'll introduce you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Mom's always trying to find me a<br>
    wife.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    But if you're too busy, I'll see<br>
    you at your father's birthday<br>
    party. Remember, if you talk to<br>
    him -- it's a surprise.</p>
  <p> She puts her finger to her lips in the &quot;shush&quot;<br>
    position. The message ends with the insignia of<br>
    Starfleet across the screen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    This came in about three weeks<br>
    ago.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I never got back to her...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Geordi, the probe has entered the<br>
    planet's atmosphere. I'm ready to<br>
    move it inside the ship.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you want to take a couple of<br>
    days off, I'll run the interface.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The interface is calibrated<br>
    specifically for my VISOR inputs.<br>
    You'd need at least ten hours to<br>
    convert it. Those crewmen down<br>
    there can't wait...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The interface doesn't have to be<br>
    fully compatible. I could use it<br>
    right now. I wouldn't have the<br>
    control you'd have, but it would<br>
    still work.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts a little too strongly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Forget it. I'm the best one for<br>
    the job, and there's no reason not<br>
    to go ahead as planned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    The Hera is reason enough.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Hera is missing. That's all.<br>
    Until I hear something more, my<br>
    mother might just as well have<br>
    taken the crew on an unscheduled<br>
    holiday.</p>
  <p> Geordi stands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> He heads for the door. OFF the concern on Riker's face<br>
    as he turns to follow.</p>
  <p>17 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf is at tactical, Riker is at aft science, Picard is<br>
    in his seat, and various N.D.s are at other posts.<br>
    Riker turns from his console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, the probe is through the<br>
    airlock and in position aboard the<br>
    Raman.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges with a nod.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Commander Data. Report.</p>
  <p>18 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi is wearing the interface helmet; Data is<br>
    adjusting it and Beverly is working at a nearby<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    We are ready to bring the<br>
    interface on line.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Activating the remote sensors...</p>
  <p> Data works the controls.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Initiating interface... now.</p>
  <p> Data turns to Geordi, whose face changes, as if he's<br>
    suddenly somewhere else.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    Vital signs normal... How do you<br>
    feel, Geordi?</p>
  <p> It takes Geordi a beat to answer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fine...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you have visual contact?</p>
  <p>19 CLOSE IN ON GEORDI'S FACE</p>
  <p> He answers as if from far away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet...</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. SCIENCE SHIP CORRIDOR - GEORDI'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Everything is dark, murky.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    Increase the input signal, Data.<br>
    I'm not seeing anything...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A beat. Suddenly, the darkness clears -- we see the<br>
    corridor, mysteriously lit and clouded with tendrils of<br>
    gas. But everything is in BLACK &amp; WHITE.</p>
  <p>21 INT. LAB</p>
  <p> Geordi's face suddenly becomes animated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can see. But no colors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Increasing signal strength of<br>
    seventy-five percent of tolerance.</p>
  <p> Data works the controls on the console.</p>
  <p>22 INT. SCIENCE SHIP CORRIDOR - GEORDI'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before in Black &amp; White. Suddenly, the scene<br>
    becomes COLORED, and we can see the glare from the Red<br>
    Alert.</p>
  <p>23 ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> standing in the corridor, looking around (the same<br>
    convention we used when he was using the probe to fight<br>
    the fire in the Teaser).</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's better.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    Your pulse has gone up...</p>
  <p>24 INT. LAB</p>
  <p> Beverly is watching the monitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It might take your nervous system<br>
    a little while to get used to this<br>
    input level.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm excited, that's all. This is<br>
    like being on a roller coaster.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>25 INT. SCIENCE SHIP CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Or a first date... Everything's<br>
    okay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I'll be the judge of that, Geordi.<br>
    If your heart rate goes too high,<br>
    we'll disconnect you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Understood. But don't pull the<br>
    plug yet...</p>
  <p> A beat as he continues to look around.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's a mess in here. There must<br>
    be a hull breach somewhere. I'm<br>
    picking up atmospheric gasses<br>
    inside the corridor -- methane and<br>
    ammonia primarily.</p>
  <p> Geordi starts slowly to walk up the corridor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm heading toward the Bridge.</p>
  <p> He continues for a few silent beats. As he goes, the<br>
    fumes increase.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's getting worse the closer I<br>
    get. The break in the hull might<br>
    be on the Bridge itself.</p>
  <p> He rounds a corner, sees a collapsed piece of material --<br>
    and a body beneath it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I found somebody!</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    What is your position?</p>
  <p> Geordi hurries forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    About twelve meters up the main<br>
    corridor! A section of the<br>
    bulkhead collapsed on top of him.</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches the trapped crew member and puts both<br>
    hands underneath the bulkhead material.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can't move it. I need more<br>
    power to the tractor beams.</p>
  <p>26 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data looks over to Beverly to see if he should comply<br>
    with Geordi's request. She checks Geordi's vital signs<br>
    for a beat, then nods a cautious go ahead.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go to eighty percent of tolerance --<br>
    no higher.</p>
  <p> Data nods and works the controls.</p>
  <p>27 INT. SCIENCE SHIP CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Geordi's hands move strongly upwards,<br>
    removing the fallen material and casting it aside. He<br>
    bends down to investigate the crew member.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He looks pretty bad.</p>
  <p> Geordi places his hands on both sides of the man's<br>
    neck.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He's dead.</p>
  <p> He goes a couple of meters up the corridor to a heavy<br>
    door. He tries to open it but can't.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data, the door halfway down the<br>
    left corridor... what's it lead<br>
    to?</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    A magnetic storage bay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    If there was a breach on the<br>
    Bridge, that would be the safest<br>
    place to go.</p>
  <p> He sees a control panel next to the door, gets an idea.<br>
    Geordi holds a hand out in front of him, palm up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data, I need a phaser burst. Wide<br>
    focus, level four intensity.</p>
  <p> The control panel is hit by a sudden burst of phasers<br>
    from Geordi's hand -- it sparks and the door slides<br>
    open, revealing the storage bay behind it.</p>
  <p> Geordi steps inside, sees six bodies.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've found them!</p>
  <p> Geordi gets closer, checks one of the bodies.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They're dead... all of them.</p>
  <p> Suddenly FLAMES flash up directly in front of Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's a fire in here...</p>
  <p> The flames suddenly leap out at him... Geordi<br>
    instinctively raises his hands to shield his face, and<br>
    when the flames make contact with his palms he cries<br>
    out in pain. The flames seem to advance on him, and he<br>
    swats at them, again crying out on contact.</p>
  <p>28 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> And again -- Geordi cries out in pain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Data! Disconnect him!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data quickly hits some controls and Geordi's face loses<br>
    its grimace.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (dazed)<br>
    I don't know... My hands...</p>
  <p> Geordi slowly brings up his hands -- his palms are<br>
    burned.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    They're burned...</p>
  <p> OFF everyone's reactions.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/20/93 - ACT THREE 21-21A </p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>29 EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit above the huge, greenish planet.</p>
  <p>30 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Geordi has both hands inside a small clear BOX that is<br>
    bathing his burns in a blue light. His wounds are<br>
    partially healed and he's still wearing the interface<br>
    suit. Picard and Beverly are standing around him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did this happen?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There was some kind of energy<br>
    discharge in the interface suit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shouldn't the safety over-rides<br>
    have prevented that?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... but I have a theory why<br>
    they didn't.</p>
  <p> Picard nods that she continue.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The tolerance levels on the<br>
    interface were set extremely high.<br>
    I think Geordi's neural response<br>
    to the input was so strong that it<br>
    created a feedback loop.</p>
  <p> Geordi pulls a hand from the burn-box and looks at the<br>
    sensors that attach to his his hands.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The sensors that were transmitting<br>
    the sensation of heat to my hands<br>
    must've overloaded.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT THREE 22.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know it seems hard to believe,<br>
    but the probe was sending huge<br>
    amounts of sensory data directly<br>
    into Geordi's brain. The<br>
    tolerance levels on the interface<br>
    were set extremely high.</p>
  <p> Picard nods -- if his experts are telling him it's<br>
    possible, that's good enough for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Raman's crew is dead. I'd<br>
    like to retrieve their vessel, but<br>
    not if it means risking Geordi's<br>
    safety.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If we turn down the sensory input<br>
    from the probe, I should be fine.</p>
  <p> Geordi sees that Picard is still unsure.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Seven people lost their lives down<br>
    there... we should at least<br>
    retrieve the data they were<br>
    collecting. Otherwise their<br>
    deaths won't have any meaning.</p>
  <p> Geordi's response is a little too emphatic. Picard and<br>
    Beverly exchange glances -- clearly recent events are<br>
    making Geordi feel strongly about this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If we operate the interface at<br>
    lower input levels, I'd say the<br>
    risk is acceptable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Alright.<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    We'll have to take it into the<br>

    the Bridge is too badly damaged.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    How long before you can get it<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Looks like you'll have some time<br>

  <p> Geordi nods.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's something I need to do<br>
    anyway.</p>
  <p>33 INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi is watching his father, DOCTOR LA FORGE, on the<br>
    small monitor. Doctor La Forge is wearing science<br>
    blue, and has three pips on his collar.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How are you, Dad?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR LA FORGE<br>
    As well as expected, given the<br>
    circumstances. Are you okay?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> His father nods. A beat.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR LA FORGE<br>
    I talked to your sister this<br>
    morning. She said she'd get in<br>
    touch with you in a few days.<br>
    Right now she's pretty upset.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The service for the Hera will<br>
    probably be on Vulcan -- most of<br>
    the crew was from there. But your<br>
    sister and I want to have a<br>
    private ceremony --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    -- Dad. Don't you think<br>
    everybody's jumping the gun here?<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT THREE 24.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    Last I heard, two starships were<br>
    still out there looking. They've<br>
    found no debris, no residual warp<br>
    distortion --</p>
  <p> DOCTOR LA FORGE<br>
    -- And no ship.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet. That doesn't mean they<br>
    won't.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR LA FORGE<br>
    Starfleet is considering the Hera<br>
    lost. The search isn't much more<br>
    than a formality at this point.<br>
    (beat; quietly)<br>
    Geordi, your mother's gone...</p>
  <p> Geordi is harsh.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You can think that if you want.<br>
    But until I see some hard<br>
    evidence, I'm not going to give up<br>
    hope.</p>
  <p> His father starts to say something, then changes his<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR LA FORGE<br>
    All right, Geordi. Call me if you<br>
    need anything...</p>
  <p> Doctor La Forge touches a control and the screen goes<br>
    blank.</p>
  <p> OFF Geordi's flat expression.</p>
  <p>34 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data is staring at a blank computer screen. The door<br>
    CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Geordi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey, Data. Still working?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT THREE 25.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data continues staring at the blank screen, as if<br>
    riveted.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. I have completed the<br>
    adjustments on the interface. I<br>
    am now waiting for Commander Riker<br>
    to finish moving the probe.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods, crosses over toward Data. Data turns to<br>
    his friend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do you wish to be comforted?</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts a bit negatively to Data's bluntness.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No... I was just passing by.<br>
    Wondered what you were up to.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: monitor)<br>
    I am using the time to catch up on<br>
    my study of poetry.</p>
  <p> Geordi steps closer, stares at the blank monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, there's nothing on the<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not entirely correct.<br>
    While it is true the display is<br>
    currently blank, this emptiness<br>
    has a poetic meaning. So it<br>
    cannot be considered &quot;nothing&quot; as<br>
    such.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Says who?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The ancient Doosodarians. Much of<br>
    their poetry contained such<br>
    &quot;lacunae&quot; or empty spaces. Often<br>
    these pauses measured several days<br>
    in length, during which poet and<br>
    audience were encouraged to fully<br>
    acknowledge the emptiness of the<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I remember some lectures at<br>
    Starfleet academy that seemed like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> A beat as Data considers his friend again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you certain you do not wish to<br>
    talk about your mother?</p>
  <p> Geordi again reacts to Data's overly direct manner.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why do you ask that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are no doubt feeling emotional<br>
    distress as a result of her<br>
    disappearance. Though you claimed<br>
    to be &quot;just passing by,&quot; that is<br>
    most likely an excuse to start a<br>
    conversation about this<br>
    uncomfortable subject. Am I<br>
    correct?</p>
  <p> Geordi overreacts.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, no. Sometimes &quot;just passing<br>
    by&quot; means &quot;just passing by.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data thinks about this for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I apologize for my premature<br>
    assumption.</p>
  <p> Data turns back to the monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This particular poem has a lacuna<br>
    of forty-seven minutes. You may<br>
    experience the emptiness with me<br>
    if you wish.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    Thanks...</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi watch the blank screen for several<br>
    silent seconds. Geordi glances at Data who appears<br>
    perfectly content to stare at nothing. Geordi scowls.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, maybe you gave up too fast.</p>
  <p> Data turns from the screen -- with some hesitation, as<br>
    though very interested in what he was watching.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    When I said &quot;just passing by&quot;<br>
    means &quot;just passing by&quot; -- I<br>
    didn't really mean it.</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head, realizing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My initial assumption was correct.<br>
    You do wish to speak of your<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Am I crazy to think she's still<br>
    alive?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your sanity is not in question.<br>
    However, your evaluation of the<br>
    available information is...<br>
    biased.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She's the captain of a starship!<br>
    She's gotten herself into and out<br>
    of impossible situations before.<br>
    Why should this be any different?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Disappearances fitting the profile<br>
    of the Hera have rarely ended with<br>
    the safe recovery of ship and<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    That makes me feel better.</p>
  <p> Data doesn't answer. Geordi feels a little guilty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry, Data. I didn't mean to<br>
    snap at you.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not offended. You are upset<br>
    and your reactions are not<br>
    surprising.</p>
  <p> Geordi quiets down.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess I am a little... on edge.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Geordi looks away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's just that... If she really is<br>
    dead...<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    I don't know what I'm going to<br>
    do...</p>
  <p> Geordi puts a hand on Data's shoulder for a moment in<br>
    silent thanks for his support, then turns and goes out<br>
    the door.</p>
  <p> Data turns again to his blank monitor for a beat, then<br>
    pauses and glances toward where Geordi disappeared, as<br>
    if still thinking of his friend...</p>

    Is it you... ?</p>
  <p> A beat, Geordi seems puzzled -- then suddenly<br>
    remembers.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I forgot! All you're seeing is a<br>
    probe. Yes, it's me. I'm on the<br>

    this probe.</p>

  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    We're dying.</p>

    No. Wait...</p>
  <p> Beverly and Data pause.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes another step toward his mother.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    We need your help. I need your<br>
    help... Geordi...</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches out with both hands, placing them on her<br>
    arms -- at the contact, there is a violent SHOCKING<br>
    ARC. He cries out in pain --</p>
  <p>44 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The safety cut-off has disengaged the interface but the<br>
    overload has caused Geordi to lose consciousness.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    The cut-off has been automatically<br>
    activated.</p>
  <p> Beverly rushes to Geordi's side.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's in neural shock --</p>
  <p> She grabs a MEDICAL DEVICE and begins to work on<br>
    Geordi. Data tries to give her room to work by<br>
    removing the interface from Geordi's head...</p>
  <p> TIME CUT TO:</p>
  <p>45 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Geordi is now sitting on the big diagnostic bed, as<br>
    Beverly runs various scans on him. He's wearing the<br>
    interface suit and his VISOR and seems a little shaken<br>
    up. Picard and Data are standing by.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR 34.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The sensory overload didn't cause<br>
    any permanent damage -- but I<br>
    wouldn't want to expose his<br>
    nervous system to that much<br>
    stimulus again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any indication of what<br>
    caused the hallucination?</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts to this characterization of his<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His brain functions are normal --</p>
  <p> Geordi interrupts:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I told you, I wasn't<br>
    hallucinating.</p>
  <p> There is an uncomfortable moment -- Picard glances at<br>
    Data and nods that he should go ahead and report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, I have analyzed the<br>
    probe's sensor logs -- there are<br>
    no readings that would indicate<br>
    the presence of a living human on<br>
    board the Raman.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She wasn't actually there. Her<br>
    ship is on the surface.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to sort out what Geordi is saying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you believe you saw some kind<br>
    of... transmission?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Somehow she managed to contact me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have no indication of a<br>
    transmission of any kind.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT FOUR 35.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe I'm the only one who could<br>
    detect it -- because I was<br>
    interfaced with the probe.</p>
  <p> Data sees what he's getting at.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The probe does allow Geordi to<br>
    sense quantum fluctuations,<br>
    subspace anomalies, and other<br>
    phenomena not perceptible to other<br>
    kinds of sensors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Granted. But why would he<br>
    perceive his mother visually, as<br>
    if she were standing in the room?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not sure... I do know that our<br>
    brains aren't designed to process<br>
    the kind of sensory information<br>
    Geordi was getting. When the<br>
    brain receives something it can't<br>
    understand, it interprets the<br>
    input as best it can -- sometimes<br>
    as a sound or smell, sometimes<br>
    visually.</p>
  <p> Geordi seizes on the validation he thinks he's getting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    You see?</p>
  <p> Beverly knows what Geordi is going through, and she<br>
    tries to be as gentle as she can.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Geordi, that doesn't mean you're<br>
    mother was really communicating<br>
    with you. I'm just trying to<br>
    explain why you might've thought<br>
    she was.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't hide his frustration.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm telling you, my mother's ship<br>
    is trapped down there -- they need<br>
    our help.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    The Hera's last reported location<br>
    was over three hundred light years<br>
    away. How could it have ended up<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> Geordi has no answer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If the Hera is on the surface, its<br>
    hull could not possibly withstand<br>
    the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>
  <p> Geordi doesn't have an explanation but he knows what he<br>
    saw.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just let me go back so we can be<br>
    sure.</p>
  <p> It hurts our people to have to reject his plea.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I don't recommend he use the<br>
    interface again -- the sensory<br>
    overload nearly killed him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll be all right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, Geordi. But I won't<br>
    risk your life.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, find another way to<br>
    salvage the Raman. I want to hear<br>
    an alternate plan in two hours.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>

  <p> Data heads for the door. Picard turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    In the meantime, I'd like you to<br>
    talk with Counselor Troi. She's<br>
    expecting you.</p>
  <p> Geordi seems about to object -- then he catches<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, Sir...</p>
  <p> OFF Geordi's frustrated look.</p>
  <p>46 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Troi is seated in a chair, watching as Geordi (now in<br>
    uniform) paces slowly in front of her. He's impatient --<br>
    he doesn't want to be here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's your mother like, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Counselor, if you think I'm going<br>
    to start talking about my<br>
    childhood, you're way off.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's not what I asked.</p>
  <p> Geordi stops pacing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, I guess not.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She was --<br>
    (catching himself)<br>
    She is... brilliant, funny...<br>
    really perceptive. She knows<br>
    people. Knows what they're all<br>
    about even before they open their<br>
    mouths. She's always been like<br>
    that. A good judge of character.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    The Enterprise and the Hera were<br>
    in the same sector three weeks<br>
    ago. She wanted to see me. We<br>

    I guess I could have made the<br>
    time. But I didn't think... I<br>

  <p> TROI<br>

    You didn't think it would be your<br>

  <p> Geordi is angered.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You don't know that! None of us<br>
    does!</p>
  <p> A long silent beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm going to suggest something.<br>
    Call it a theory. Alright?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (calms down)<br>
    Alright...</p>
  <p> Troi stands.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're very worried about the<br>
    disappearance of your mother...<br>
    and guilty over not seeing her<br>
    when you had the chance. So<br>
    you're unwilling even to consider<br>
    that she might be dead. This need<br>
    to believe she's alive is so<br>
    strong, it manifested itself as a<br>
    physical image.</p>

  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But she told me she's trapped on<br>
    the planet! She's in danger! If<br>
    this was some kind of wish<br>
    fulfillment, don't you think I'd<br>
    fantasize her being safe and<br>
    sound?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. Because that would end the<br>
    fantasy -- you'd know it wasn't<br>
    true. The more involved and<br>
    complicated and unending your<br>
    story is, the longer you can<br>
    believe your mother is still<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> Geordi stops pacing. He thinks for a moment, then<br>
    looks at her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's your theory, Counselor.<br>
    I've got a different one.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS. OFF the concern on Troi's face.</p>
  <p>47 INT. OBS LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Geordi. Data is presenting his<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been exploring the<br>
    possibility of using a tractor<br>
    beam to pull the Raman from the<br>
    atmosphere. However, there is so<br>
    much interference that it prevents<br>
    a positive lock.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we could set up some sort of<br>
    relay system...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is my conclusion as well,<br>
    Commander. Two shuttlecraft,<br>
    staggered between the Enterprise<br>

    Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I suppose so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes. As long as you keep them<br>

    We'll be leaving my mother and her<br>

  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    Well, I've seen the Hera -- it<br>
    uses trionic initiators in the<br>
    warp coil. They have a history of<br>
    strange side effects -- especially<br>
    if you start playing around with<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at Data for confirmation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There have been reports of warp<br>
    bubbles and other subspace<br>
    deformations.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    So what if that's what happened?<br>
    Not a warp bubble, but a subspace<br>
    funnel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Connecting two points through<br>
    subspace.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The Hera could have accidentally<br>
    created a distortion that emptied<br>
    out right here, on Marijne Seven.</p>
  <p> It seems unlikely to everyone but Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why here?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Hera passed near this planet<br>
    just ten days ago. There's a lot<br>
    of subspace distortion in the<br>
    atmosphere -- the ship might've<br>
    picked up some residual traces<br>
    that directed the funnel back<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (disbelieving)<br>
    And the Hera is still in one<br>
    piece, down on the surface?</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe it's surrounded by some kind<br>
    of subspace field that's keeping<br>
    it together. But who knows for<br>
    how long?</p>
  <p> Geordi looks absolutely convinced.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any evidence to<br>
    support this... hypothesis?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I did get some strange subspace<br>
    readings when I was interfaced<br>
    with the probe.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, that could be anything.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I talked to her. She asked me to<br>
    take the Raman closer to the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is any of this possible?</p>
  <p> Data considers the fantastic story for a couple of<br>
    beats.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There.</p>
  <p> Data seems conscious of not wanting to offend his<br>
    friend, but he still has to do his job.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, I believe it is...<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    unlikely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How unlikely?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nearly impossible, Sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, considers for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed with the shuttle plan.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Mister La Forge. Stay here for<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to the rest of the staff in dismissal.<br>
    Everyone heads out the door, as Geordi sits back down.<br>
    When the door closes behind the last one --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Geordi, I'm not unsympathetic<br>
    about what you're going through.<br>
    But I want you to consider my<br>
    position as well.</p>
  <p> A beat. Geordi reluctantly decides to listen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, Sir.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your mother's disappearance...<br>
    It's... a tragic thing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I can't risk your safety on<br>
    the basis of a dubious hypothesis.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If there's even one chance in a<br>
    million I'm right and she's<br>
    alive...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- this is a no-win situation for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, Geordi. I've made my<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> A beat. Geordi appears to have given up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I understand, Sir.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the door to the Bridge. Geordi stays<br>
    for a beat. Then with resolve, heads for the opposite<br>
    exit...</p>

    Suddenly the door OPENS and reveals Data standing<br>
    there. Geordi reacts; he's been caught.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suspected you would decide to<br>
    operate the interface alone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You did?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am familiar enough with your<br>
    behavior patterns to predict<br>
    certain... decisions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess you know me pretty well...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are disobeying the Captain.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't just sit back and do<br>
    nothing when my mother might be<br>
    down on that planet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can not allow you to endanger<br>
    your well being.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If we leave here without knowing<br>
    for sure...</p>
  <p> He stops, all the pent up emotions inside him finally<br>
    come to a head. He's so overcome that he turns away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll have to live with it for the<br>
    rest of my life... wondering... if<br>
    I left her to die... I couldn't<br>
    take that, Data... I couldn't...</p>
  <p> There is an anguish in Geordi's voice that Data can't<br>
    ignore.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's why I have to do this.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If you want to do that to me,<br>
    Data, then go ahead. Because<br>
    nothing less is going to stop me<br>
    from trying to save my mother.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and continues setting up the interface.<br>
    Data considers for a long moment, then takes up<br>
    position next to the console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will monitor the interface and<br>
    attempt to keep you safe.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at him, surprised. Data is seizing on a<br>
    point of logic in order to rationalize helping him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can not have you confined to<br>
    quarters for something you have<br>
    not yet done.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, we could both end up in a<br>
    lot of trouble for this.</p>
  <p> Data is already working the interface controls.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is a high degree of<br>
    probability that you are right.</p>
  <p> Geordi is touched.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, Data.</p>
  <p> Geordi removes the VISOR and pulls the interface unit<br>
    over his head.<br>
    DATA<br>
    However, I have a request.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would ask you to consider the<br>
    possibility that what you see is<br>
    not real.</p>
  <p> Geordi pauses for a moment -- Data has gotten through<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I will. I promise.</p>
  <p> Data works the console.</p>

  <p>51 INT. AUXILIARY CONTROL</p>
  <p> Geordi as probe is standing inside Auxiliary Control.<br>
    He glances around the room -- he is alone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Mom... ?</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE (O.S.)<br>
    Hello, Geordi...</p>
  <p> Geordi whips around at the voice.</p>
  <p>52 INCLUDE SILVA LA FORGE</p>
  <p> standing nearby, where Geordi was looking only a moment<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How did you get here?</p>
  <p> A moment as Silva stares at him.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    I'm not really with you, Geordi.<br>
    I'm on my ship, on the surface.<br>
    We were pulled into a warp funnel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's just what I thought!</p>
  <p> He stares at her -- it seems he was right.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How are we communicating?</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    We found a way to send a subspace<br>
    signal that could cut through the<br>
    atmospheric interference.</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    Geordi, are you seeing the image<br>
    of your mother... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>53 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data is carefully watching Geordi's reactions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, and she just confirmed<br>
    everything I've been saying.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am reading some unusual subspace<br>
    energy in your vicinity -- similar<br>
    to what the probe sensors recorded<br>
    the first time you encountered<br>
    your mother.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's how she's communicating<br>
    with me. It's the only kind of<br>
    signal they could send that would<br>
    get through the interference.</p>
  <p> We see on Data's face that Geordi's story is starting<br>
    to seem more plausible.</p>
  <p>54 INT. AUXILIARY CONTROL</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    We need your help.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've been thinking about this --<br>
    I'm going to take the Raman into<br>
    a low stationary orbit and<br>
    initiate an inverse warp cascade.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The subspace distortion from the<br>
    cascade should reverse the warp<br>
    funnel -- your ship will end up<br>
    right where it started.</p>
  <p>55 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, the atmosphere becomes<br>
    increasingly turbulent the farther<br>

    the Hera before being destroyed.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    That is theoretically true. But<br>
    even at this input level you have<br>

    If we cut him off abruptly, he'll<br>
    go into neural shock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can we lower the input<br>
    gradually and still get him out<br>
    before it's too late?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we can deceive his neural<br>
    receptors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Deceive them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    By feeding them the sensory<br>
    information recorded from his<br>
    earlier experiences with the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    We could disconnect the interface<br>
    and still maintain the input<br>
    levels.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We could then lower them in a<br>
    controlled manner.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/19/93 - ACT FIVE 55A.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Like a decompression tank.<br>
    (off their nods)<br>
    Let's try it.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Data get to work. Suddenly Geordi speaks<br>
    to our people.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain. I have to take the ship<br>
    into the lower atmosphere...</p>
  <p>73 INT. AUXILIARY CONTROL - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Geordi is working the console. Silva is standing in<br>
    the background, as if waiting. Picard's voice is<br>
    barely audible.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/19/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    As I understand it... when the<br>
    Raman got close to the planet,<br>
    they accidentally picked up some<br>
    lifeforms that live in the lower<br>
    atmosphere. Subspace beings of<br>
    some kind -- intelligent. When<br>
    the ship went back into a higher<br>
    orbit, the beings were trapped.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    How do you know all this?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    One of them is able to communicate<br>
    with me. It must have read my<br>
    thoughts through the probe<br>
    interface and took the form of my<br>
    Mother -- to try to talk me into<br>
    taking the ship closer to the<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    Were these beings responsible for<br>
    the death of the Raman's crew?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, but I don't think it was on<br>
    purpose. They probably tried to<br>
    communicate with them the same way<br>
    they're communicating with me --<br>
    by directly accessing their<br>
    thoughts. That must've been fatal<br>
    to the crew... I guess the<br>
    interface protected me.</p>
  <p>74 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to Geordi's report.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have to take them back -- they<br>
    can't survive so far up in the<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p>75 INT. AUXILIARY CONTROL - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll turn the ship around and come<br>
    back as soon as we're --</p>
  <p> Suddenly the ship JOLTS VIOLENTLY. A console EXPLODES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    La Forge! What happened?</p>
  <p> Geordi recovers and starts working the console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The atmosphere is getting more<br>
    turbulent. It's overloading the<br>
    systems.</p>
  <p> The ship rocks again. Geordi holds onto the console,<br>
    working like crazy. Small explosions can be heard<br>
    offscreen -- the ship is coming apart.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm having trouble keeping the<br>
    shields up.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to her.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're safe now...</p>
  <p> Geordi stares at her -- it's a strange moment, she is<br>
    and is not his mother.</p>
  <p> SILVA LA FORGE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good bye...</p>
  <p> Before Geordi can say anything -- she becomes a flame.<br>
    And quickly moves straight through the bulkhead,<br>
    disappearing completely.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns back to the console. Suddenly the ship<br>
    SHAKES and another console EXPLODES.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm losing power...</p>
  <p>76 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Beverly continues to work as fast as she can.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - 07/14/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>76 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Total shield failure in eight<br>
    seconds...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Beverly and Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you ready to switch inputs?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Almost.</p>
  <p>77 INT. AUXILIARY CONTROL - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi at the controls.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Shields are failing...</p>
  <p> Geordi cries out as the ship suddenly EXPLODES and his<br>
    link to the probe is severed.</p>
  <p> HARD CUT TO:</p>
  <p>78 INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Geordi continues the same cry, Beverly hits a<br>
    control on the interface console.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Switching inputs!</p>
  <p> Geordi's face suddenly seems to freeze in its<br>
    expression. Everyone watches for several tense beats.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it working?</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts to the monitor and administers a hypo to<br>
    Geordi's neck. After a beat, Geordi's face relaxes.<br>
    Beverly responds to what she sees on the monitor,<br>
    smiling.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His vital signs are stabilizing.<br>
    He's going to make it.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts with relief.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/20/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>79 EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is at impulse across a field of stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. We<br>
    have succeeded in disengaging<br>
    Mister La Forge from the interface<br>
    and are en route to Starbase four-nine-five.</p>
  <p>80 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is behind his desk, Geordi standing somewhat<br>
    formally in front of him -- he's been called on the<br>
    carpet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You disobeyed my direct order, and<br>
    you put yourself in grave danger.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm not happy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's my fault, sir. Data was just --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I'll deal with Data at another<br>
    time. Meanwhile, I'll have to<br>
    write this incident into your<br>
    permanent record.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard crosses around his desk. His tone<br>
    softens.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm very sorry you didn't find<br>
    your mother.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods sadly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/16/93 - ACT FIVE 59A.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thank you, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I was down there... it was so<br>
    real. It's funny, but in a way...<br>
    I feel like I got a chance to say<br>
    goodbye...</p>
  <p> Picard puts a comforting hand to Geordi's shoulder...<br>
    A moment between them...</p>
  <p>81 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves slowly away...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Interface&quot; - REV. 07/20/93 - ACT FIVE 59B.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S DIALOGUE - PAGE 55, SCENE 72</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're trapped?</p>
  <p> A long beat as he listens.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Caught on the ship...</p>
  <p> Another long beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You killed the Raman's crew?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What do you want?</p>
