    &quot;All Good Things&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. CORRIDOR - PRESENT</p>
  <p> WORF and TROI ENTER from the Holodeck doors. They are<br>
    dressed in casual clothing -- it's late, and the mood<br>
    is light and intimate. Troi is smiling, and even Worf<br>
    is happy -- it's clear they had a great time, wherever<br>
    they were.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That was an incredible program.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am glad you approve. I have<br>
    always found the Black Sea at<br>
    night to be a most... stimulating<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> Troi rolls her eyes at him as they begin to walk down<br>
    the corridor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, we were strolling barefoot<br>
    along the beach while balalaika<br>
    music played in the air... ocean<br>
    breeze washing over us... stars in<br>
    the sky... a full moon rising...<br>
    and the most you can say is<br>
    &quot;stimulating&quot;?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (groping)<br>
    It was... very stimulating.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles as they turn a corner...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2 ANOTHER CORRIDOR - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi walking towards her quarters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The truth is, I don't spend nearly<br>
    enough time on the Holodeck.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    I should take my own advice and<br>
    use it to relax.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Next time, I'll choose the<br>
    program. If you like the Black<br>
    Sea, you're going to love Lake<br>
    Cataria on Betazed.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns a little. They stop outside Troi's<br>
    quarters. An awkward moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deanna... perhaps before there is<br>
    a &quot;next time&quot; we should discuss...<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (playful)<br>
    Why, is he coming along?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (awkward)<br>
    No... but I do not wish to... I<br>
    mean, it would be unfortunate if<br>
    he... if you and I are going to<br>
    continue... I do not want to hurt<br>
    his feelings...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... I think it's all right to<br>
    concentrate on our feelings...<br>
    yours... and mine.</p>
  <p> She smiles affectionately at him, and Worf returns the<br>
    smile. We can see that there is a genuine attraction<br>
    between the two of them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> There is a beat as they look into each other's eyes...<br>
    the sexual tension rises a notch... will they or won't<br>
    they? Finally, Worf takes the plunge -- leans over to<br>
    kiss her... she lifts her lips to his, but just before<br>
    they can kiss, the nearby Turbolift doors OPEN and<br>
    PICARD bursts out, wearing only his bathrobe --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor!</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi look at him, startled. Picard rushes to<br>
    them. He's wild-eyed, clearly something is wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    What's today's date? The date?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Stardate 47988.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks about this for a moment -- trying to sort<br>
    through something in his mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    47988...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, what's wrong?</p>
  <p> Picard looks at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure... I don't know<br>
    how... or why, but...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm moving back and forth through<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> OFF their reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p> INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - PRESENT</p>
  <p> A short time later. Troi is handing Picard a cup of<br>
    tea. Picard is pacing, trying to make sense of what's<br>
    happening to him. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was as though I had physically<br>
    left the ship and gone to another<br>
    time and place... I was in the<br>
    past...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Can you describe where you were...<br>
    what it looked like?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's all slipping away so fast...<br>
    like waking up from a nightmare...</p>
  <p> Picard concentrates.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It was years ago... before I took<br>
    command of the Enterprise. I was<br>
    talking with someone... I don't<br>
    remember who...<br>
    (beat, remembering)<br>
    But then -- everything changed.<br>
    I wasn't in the past any longer...<br>
    I was an old man, in the future...<br>
    I was doing something outside...<br>
    what was it?</p>
  <p> He holds out a hand, rubs his fingers together as<br>
    though remembering doing something with his hands...<br>
    but what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry. It's gone. I can't<br>
    remember...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's all right. Have you<br>
    considered the possibility that<br>
    this was just a dream?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was more than a dream... the<br>
    smells and the sounds... the way<br>
    things felt to the touch... it was<br>
    all so real...</p>
  <p> Troi considers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How long did you stay in each of<br>
    these time periods? Did it seem<br>
    like minutes... hours?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure.<br>
    (struggling to recall)<br>
    At first... there was a moment of<br>
    confusion, of disorientation. I<br>
    wasn't sure where I was. But that<br>
    passed... and then I felt<br>
    perfectly natural... as though I<br>
    belonged in that time. But I<br>
    can't remember how long I stayed<br>
    there.<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    I know this doesn't make much<br>
    sense... it's a feeling more than<br>
    a distinct memory.</p>
  <p> He looks down at his tea cup -- it's empty. Troi<br>
    notices and picks up the tea pot to pour him another<br>
    cup.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe we can identify specific<br>
    symbols. Can you remember<br>
    anything you saw, an object, a<br>
    building perhaps --</p>
  <p> As Troi talks, Picard extends his arm with his teacup,<br>
    offering it to her. As he extends his arm, the SCENE<br>
    SUDDENLY CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>3A ANGLE - CLOSE ON A VINE</p>
  <p>4 EXT. VINEYARD - FUTURE - DAY</p>
  <p> We are now twenty-five years in the future. Picard is<br>
    an OLD MAN, wearing civilian clothes and a hat to<br>
    protect himself from the sun. He has a beard and<br>
    longer hair. (But he should not look as old as he did<br>
    at the end of &quot;The Inner Light&quot;.) He is kneeling in a<br>
    row of grape vines at his home in France (as seen in<br>
    &quot;Family&quot;).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He is reaching out for a vine with the same hand and in<br>
    the same manner that we just saw him hold out his cup<br>
    in Troi's quarters. As his hand closes around the<br>
    vine, he hesitates. He seems disoriented, confused for<br>
    a moment, just as he described to Troi. He looks<br>
    around the vineyard in puzzlement. But the moment<br>
    passes, and he accepts this time as the present.</p>
  <p> He concentrates on examining the vine in his hand. He<br>
    takes a pruning shear and snips off a few stray<br>
    branches. There are gardening tools nearby. He works<br>
    quietly for a moment... then we hear a voice shout<br>
    across the vineyard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    (calls out)<br>
    Captain Picard to the Bridge!</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, a little surprised. He looks toward the<br>
    sound of the voice, shielding his eyes from the sun...</p>
  <p>5 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> revealing GEORDI walking toward Picard. He is wearing<br>
    civilian clothes and he has also aged twenty-five<br>
    years. His VISOR is gone and has been replaced by<br>
    ARTIFICIAL EYES, which have a distinctive electronic<br>
    look to them. Geordi is smiling broadly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    Sir, I think we have a problem<br>
    with the warp core, or the phase<br>
    inducers, or some other damn<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p> Picard stands up with some difficulty. He's old, and<br>
    his voice and attitude should suggest advanced age and<br>
    an eccentric, sometimes cantankerous demeanor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> The two men approach each other and shake hands --<br>
    these are two old friends who haven't seen each other<br>
    in a very long time.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hello, Captain... or should I make<br>
    that Ambassador?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (snorts)<br>
    Hasn't been Ambassador for a while<br>
    either.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How about Mister Picard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How about... Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I don't know if I can get used to<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a moment, taking in the<br>
    sight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good Lord, Geordi. How long has<br>
    it been?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh... about nine years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no... I mean, since you last<br>
    called me Captain? When was the<br>
    last time we were all together...<br>
    on the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Close to twenty-five years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Twenty-five years...<br>
    (looks him over)<br>
    Time's been good to you.</p>
  <p> Geordi playfully pats his stomach.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's been a little too good to me<br>
    in some places.</p>
  <p> He glances around.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can I give you a hand?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh... I'm just tying some vines.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi kneels down and examines a vine.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Looks like you've got leaf miners.<br>
    Might want to use a bacillus<br>
    spray.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    My wife is quite a gardener. I've<br>
    picked up a little bit of it.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a tie and begins carefully tying the<br>
    vines. Picard bends down with a little difficulty...<br>
    and the two of them start to work on the vines.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is Leah?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Busy as ever. She's just been<br>
    made director of the Daystrom<br>
    Institute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the little ones... Bret and<br>
    Alandra? And...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And Sidney. Not so little any<br>
    more. Bret's applying to<br>
    Starfleet Academy next year.</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head at the rapid passage of time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So what brings you here?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh... I just thought I'd drop by.<br>
    I'd been thinking about the old<br>
    days on the Enterprise... and I<br>
    was in the neighborhood...</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a sharp look. The Picard of the<br>
    future is a bit disgruntled, a cranky old man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't give me that. You don't<br>
    make the trip from Rigel Three to<br>
    Earth just to... drop by.</p>
  <p> Geordi knows he can't fool this man. The mood becomes<br>
    a little more somber.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So. You've heard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... Leah has a few friends at<br>
    Starfleet medical... and word gets<br>
    around.</p>
  <p> Picard snorts and turns his attention to the vines.<br>
    Grumpily --<br>
    PICARD<br>
    I'm not an invalid, you know.<br>
    Irumodic Syndrome can take years<br>
    to run its course.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know. But when I heard I<br>
    just... wanted to come by all the<br>
    same.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him for a moment, and then some of the<br>
    crusty exterior falls away... and we can tell that<br>
    despite his protestations to the contrary, Picard is<br>
    warmed by the moment. Picard finally breaks the<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softer)<br>
    Well... as long as you're here,<br>
    you can help me carry in some of<br>
    these tools.</p>
  <p> Picard awkwardly and painfully gets to his feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My cooking may not be up to Leah's<br>
    standards, but I can still make a<br>
    decent cup of tea.</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi both grab an armful of equipment and<br>
    they start walking.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    By the way, I read your last<br>
    novel. Not bad. I thought the<br>
    protagonist was written a bit<br>
    flamboyantly, but that's just my --</p>

    offcamera...</p>

  <p>6 PICARD'S POV</p>
  <p> Standing in the vineyards are THREE scraggly-looking<br>
    HUMANS. They point at Picard, shouting and jeering.</p>
  <p>7 RESUME PICARD</p>
  <p> He reacts to this strange sight in the vineyard.</p>
  <p>8 NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING GEORDI</p>
  <p> Geordi follows Picard's look, but sees nothing. Picard<br>
    is mystified -- what's going on? We MOVE IN on Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, are you all right?<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> TASHA'S VOICE<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard turns at the sound of Tasha's voice, and as he<br>
    does, the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>9 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard is sitting in the co-pilot's seat, wearing his<br>
    OLD-STYLE UNIFORM as seen in the first season. TASHA<br>
    YAR is sitting next to him. She looks exactly as she<br>
    did in the series pilot.</p>
  <p> TASHA'S VOICE<br>
    Are you all right, sir?</p>
  <p> He looks disoriented and confused again. He is still<br>
    not fully aware of what's happening to him. Then the<br>
    moment passes.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, Lieutenant. My mind<br>
    seems to have wandered for a<br>
    moment...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What were you saying?</p>
  <p> Tasha has that no-nonsense, military prickliness.<br>
    These are two people who have just met a short time<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I was asking if you'd ever been<br>
    aboard a Galaxy Class starship<br>
    before, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to focus his mind on the here and now,<br>
    putting aside his strange feeling of disorientation for<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I'm, of course, very familiar<br>
    with the blueprints and<br>
    specifications... but this will<br>
    be my first time aboard.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Well then, sir, if I may be so<br>
    bold -- you're in for a treat.<br>
    The Enterprise is quite a ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure she is.</p>
  <p> Picard gives her that strange stare again. For some<br>
    reason, something about her troubles him slightly.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Have I done something wrong, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. You just seem very...<br>
    familiar.</p>
  <p> She nods, uncertain exactly what he's talking about.<br>
    The console BEEPS. Tasha hits a control and we hear a<br>
    com voice --</p>
  <p> COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise to Shuttlecraft<br>
    Galileo. You are cleared for<br>
    arrival in Shuttlebay Two.</p>

  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Acknowledged, Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Tasha works the controls a moment, then looks out the<br>
    window.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There she is...</p>
  <p> Picard looks out the window...</p>
  <p>10 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Through the windows of the shuttle we can see the<br>
    ENTERPRISE sitting in its dock above Earth.</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE ON PICARD'S FACE</p>
  <p> As soon as Picard sees the ship, his feeling of<br>
    disorientation is forgotten, and he can't help but<br>
    smile at the beautiful sight. PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE<br>
    ARE NOW IN:</p>
  <p>12 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard still smiling, staring, holding a cup of tea<br>
    half-way to his mouth. (NOTE: We will no longer be<br>
    using the convention of Picard returning to the exact<br>
    moment he left.) Troi looks at him oddly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard glances around, momentarily disoriented.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tasha... I was just with Tasha, in<br>
    the shuttle...</p>
  <p> Picard slumps back into a chair. He puts his hands to<br>
    his head, clearly distraught. Troi can see that<br>
    there's something very wrong with the Captain. She<br>
    hits a panel.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 INT. SICKBAY - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Later. Picard is sitting on a bio-bed, still wearing<br>
    his bathrobe. BEVERLY is finishing a scan.</p>
  <p> Troi is standing with Picard as Beverly approaches with<br>
    the results of a scan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've finished the neurographic<br>
    scan. I don't see anything that<br>
    might cause hallucinations or a<br>
    psychogenic reaction.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is there any indication of<br>
    temporal displacement?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. Usually a temporal shift<br>
    would leave some kind of trypamine<br>
    residue in the cerebral cortex.<br>
    But the scan didn't find any.<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Personally, I think you just enjoy<br>
    waking everyone up in the middle<br>
    of the night.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles a little -- grateful for Beverly's effort<br>
    to lighten the mood.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually, I just like running<br>
    around the ship in my bare feet.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles at him. OGAWA walks over, holding a<br>
    PADD. She is visibly pregnant -- around six months.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    The bio-spectral test results,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks over the PADD.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Your blood gas analysis is<br>
    consistent with someone who's been<br>
    breathing the ship's air for<br>
    weeks.<br>

    Thanks, Alissa.</p>
  <p> Ogawa smiles and withdraws. Beverly turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Deanna... would you excuse us?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Troi moves away and EXITS Sickbay. Beverly turns back<br>
    to Picard. She is solemn, troubled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... I scanned for any<br>
    evidence of Irumodic Syndrome, as<br>
    you suggested. There wasn't any.<br>
    But I did detect a small<br>
    structural defect in your parietal<br>
    lobe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A defect... that you've never<br>
    noticed before?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's the kind of thing that would<br>
    only show up on a level four<br>
    neurographic scan.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It could leave you susceptible to<br>
    several neurological disorders...<br>
    including Irumodic Syndrome.</p>
  <p> Picard absorbs this news.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now, it's possible you could have<br>
    that defect for the rest of your<br>
    life without developing a<br>
    problem...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... but even if you do... many<br>

    Then why do you look like you've<br>
    just signed my death sentence?</p>
  <p> He's trying to lighten the moment, and she realizes<br>
    he's picked up on her underlying feelings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I guess... this has caught me off<br>
    guard.</p>
  <p> He takes a breath, squares himself -- he's not going to<br>
    waste concern over something he can't control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, let's not worry about it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Something tells me you're going to<br>
    have to put up with me for a very<br>
    long time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (trying to be light)<br>
    It won't be easy, but I'll manage.</p>
  <p> They smile at each other in a friendly, intimate way.<br>
    RIKER ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>

    No, sir. His security scans came<br>

    They're checking the sensor<br>
    logs... but there's still no<br>
    indication that you left the ship.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up off the bed, thinks for a moment. He<br>
    seems more sure of himself than he did earlier -- the<br>
    memories are still vague but he's sure that something<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It wasn't a dream... something did<br>

  <p> Picard moves toward the office...</p>
  <p>14 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, sits down at the desk and activates the<br>
    desktop monitor. After a beat, ADMIRAL NAKAMURA<br>
    appears on the screen.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    I'm initiating a fleetwide Yellow<br>
    Alert. Starfleet intelligence has<br>
    picked up some disturbing reports<br>
    from the Romulan Empire. It<br>
    appears that at least thirty<br>
    Warbirds have been pulled from<br>
    other assignments and are heading<br>
    for the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any indication why they<br>
    would make such a blatantly<br>
    aggressive move?</p>
  <p> Nakamura looks disturbed.</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Our operatives on Romulus have<br>
    indicated that there appears to be<br>
    something happening in the Neutral<br>
    Zone -- specifically, in the<br>
    Devron System. Our own long range<br>
    scans have picked up some kind of<br>
    spatial anomaly in the area, but<br>
    we can't tell what it is.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are our orders?</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    This is a delicate situation. I'm<br>
    deploying fifteen starships along<br>
    our side of the Neutral Zone. I<br>
    want you to go there as well --<br>
    see if you can find out what's<br>
    going on in the Devron System.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I authorized to enter the Zone?</p>
  <p> NAKAMURA<br>
    Not yet. Wait and see what the<br>
    Romulans do. You can conduct long-range<br>
    scans, send probes if<br>
    necessary... but don't cross the<br>
    border unless they do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.</p>

  <p> Picard turns off the monitor and stands. As he does,<br>
    the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>15 EXT. VINEYARD - FUTURE - DAY</p>
  <p> In the same motion, the older Picard rises to his feet --<br>
    and in doing so, stumbles and nearly falls. Geordi<br>
    grabs him by the arm, tries to help him up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain... what's wrong?</p>
  <p> Picard gets to his feet, looks around in confusion.<br>
    Geordi is very concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This isn't my time. I belong<br>
    somewhere else...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him, realizing he may not be making<br>
    sense.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I mean... I... I wasn't here a<br>
    moment ago...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What do you mean? You've been<br>
    right here with me...</p>
  <p> Picard gropes for an answer, tries to concentrate...<br>
    but his mental faculties in this time period have<br>
    deteriorated. He's much less cogent than the Picard<br>
    we're used to -- it's hard for him to describe the<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no... I was somewhere else...<br>
    a long time ago...<br>
    (beat)<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    No. I know what you're thinking.<br>
    It's the Irumodic Syndrome -- it's<br>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> EXT. CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - FUTURE - DAY (MATTE)</p>
  <p> The old school looks much as it always has over the<br>
    centuries, with a few 24th century touches.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/25/94 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>19 INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - DAY</p>
  <p> A spacious and very comfortable room. The walls are<br>
    lined with books. There is a FIRE roaring in the<br>
    hearth. And there are about ten CATS wandering about<br>
    or sleeping. (The mood and feel should remind us of<br>
    the Sherlock Homes Drawing Room set.)</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi are seated on a couch. DATA is<br>
    standing nearby. He has not aged over the years, but<br>
    there is a prominent streak of gray on one side of his<br>
    head -- it looks unnatural, as if someone has taken a<br>
    paint brush to his head. He is wearing the 24th<br>
    century version of a smoking jacket. Data's struggle<br>
    to become more human has progressed in the future. And<br>
    although we will never spell out exactly how far he's<br>
    come, we will see that he seems far more at ease with<br>
    himself and others. He uses contractions, has a<br>
    relatively sophisticated understanding of humanity, and<br>
    seems to genuinely enjoy life.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know how it sounds... but it<br>
    happened. It was real. I was<br>
    back on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi exchange a look.</p>

  <p> Before they can comment, JESSEL, Data's English<br>

    woman in her fifties with a heavy British accent.</p>
  <p> JESSEL<br>

    How do you like your tea?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tea? Earl Grey. Hot.</p>

    Of course it's hot. What do ya<br>
    want in it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing...</p>
  <p> Picard shifts to another topic unexpectedly -- another<br>
    sign that his mind tends to wander occasionally. This<br>
    will continue to happen throughout the script.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is quite a place you have<br>
    here, Data. I see they treat<br>
    Professors pretty well at<br>
    Cambridge...</p>

    (to Geordi, re: Data)<br>
    If you're really his friend,<br>
    you'll get him to take that grey<br>
    out of his hair. He looks like a<br>
    bloody skunk.</p>
  <p> Jessel moves back to the service, shoos a few cats off<br>
    the furniture. Data gives Geordi a look.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    And yes, I know it's not a cure...<br>
    nothing can stop the deterioration<br>
    of my... my synaptic pathways...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You think I'm senile... that this<br>
    is all some... delusion.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No one said anything like that.</p>
  <p> Data holds Picard's gaze steadily, not shying away from<br>
    giving him the unvarnished truth.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In all honesty, Captain, it's a<br>
    thought that has occurred to me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, there is nothing to<br>
    disprove what you are saying,<br>
    either. So it's possible<br>
    something is happening to you.</p>
  <p> Picard looks hopeful. Data starts pacing, a human<br>
    gesture that Data has obviously acquired.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The first thing we should do is<br>
    give you a complete series of<br>
    neurographic scans. We can use<br>
    the equipment at the bio-metrics<br>
    lab here on campus.<br>
    (to Jessel)<br>
    Jessel, ask Professor Rippert to<br>
    take over my lecture for tomorrow<br>
    and possibly for the rest of the<br>
    week.</p>
  <p> Picard is enthused.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's the Data I remember! I<br>
    knew I could count on you!</p>
  <p> In his excitement, Picard spills some of his hot tea<br>
    onto his lap. He yells out and JUMPS to his feet, and<br>
    as he does, the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>20 INT. SHUTTLEBAY - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard is JUMPING out of the shuttlecraft, which is now<br>
    sitting in the middle of the bay. Picard hesitates for<br>
    a moment, disoriented at first. A large group of<br>
    CREWMEMBERS are lined up in several ranks next to the<br>
    shuttle standing at ease. Visible at the front of the<br>
    group are Troi, O'BRIEN and Worf -- all are wearing the<br>
    uniforms and &quot;look&quot; of &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. Tasha<br>
    steps out behind Picard and calls out in a loud voice:</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Commanding officer...<br>
    Enterprise... arriving.</p>
  <p> At this command, an Ensign smartly brings an old-fashioned<br>
    Bosun's whistle to his lips and BLOWS it. At<br>
    the sound of the whistle, everyone in the bay snaps to<br>
    attention. Picard stares at the scene for a moment,<br>
    silently orienting himself to where and when he is. He<br>
    takes a beat, then moves to a nearby podium, sets the<br>
    PADD on it and looks up at the crowd. There's a<br>
    distracted look on his face -- he's moving forward with<br>
    the ceremony, but at the same time his mind is trying<br>
    to assimilate all that's happened to him so far.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    To Captain Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    Stardate 41148...</p>
  <p> Picard glances up from the PADD...</p>

  <p> There are now six scraggly humans standing on the<br>
    catwalk, laughing and jeering.</p>
  <p>26 PICARD</p>
  <p> looks away from the crowd, tries to concentrate on what<br>
    he's doing. There's an awkward silence. Tasha gives<br>
    him a slightly puzzled look -- what's wrong with him?<br>
    Picard clears his throat and then continues...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... to take command of the USS<br>
    Enterprise as of this date.<br>
    Signed Rear Admiral Norah Satie,<br>
    Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> He turns off the PADD, steps out from behind the podium<br>
    and looks at his crew. They stare back at him<br>
    silently, waiting for his first words for them -- the<br>
    first words from the Captain of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S POV - THE CATWALK</p>
  <p> There are now ten of the humans standing there -- all<br>
    shouting at Picard with menacing looks.</p>

  <p> reacts.</p>

  <p> There is a shocked and silent moment from the crowd.<br>
    This is the last thing they expected. Tasha gives him<br>
    a startled look, but recovers quickly -- she barks at<br>
    the crowd.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    You heard him -- move!</p>
  <p> The ship goes to RED ALERT. People rush out the<br>
    shuttlebay doors to their duty stations. OFF the mad<br>

  <p>32 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard is staring out the windows as the crew of the<br>
    past is filing in -- Tasha, Worf, Troi. The room<br>
    appears as it did in the FIRST SEASON, complete with<br>
    gold ship models on the wall. Camera should FAVOR<br>
    Tasha, to orient us that we're in the past.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Personal Log: Stardate 41153.7.<br>
    Recorded under security lockout<br>
    Omega three-two-seven. I have<br>
    decided not to inform this crew of<br>
    my experiences. If it's true that<br>
    I've travelled to the past, I<br>
    cannot risk giving them<br>
    foreknowledge of what's to come.</p>
  <p> Picard sits as the others do. They eye him warily --<br>
    these people don't know Picard and are not comfortable<br>
    around him or each other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We've completed a full subspace<br>
    scan of the ship and surrounding<br>
    space. We detected no unusual<br>
    readings or anomalies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    With all due respect, sir... it<br>
    would help if we knew what we were<br>
    looking for.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Noted.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor, do you sense anything<br>
    unusual aboard the Enterprise...<br>
    an alien presence that doesn't<br>
    belong here... perhaps operating<br>
    on a level of intelligence far<br>
    superior to our own?</p>
  <p> Troi pauses, thinks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, sir. I'm only aware of the<br>
    crew... and the families aboard<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, takes a few steps around the table. They<br>
    watch him carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, I want you to<br>
    initiate a Level Two Security<br>
    Alert on all decks until further<br>
    notice.</p>
  <p> Worf looks surprised, and gives an awkward glance to<br>
    Tasha. Tasha takes a step forward. She keeps her<br>
    voice level, but it's clear that Picard's order has<br>
    rankled her for some reason.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir, with all due respect... I'm<br>
    the Security Chief on this ship.<br>
    Unless you're planning to make a<br>
    change...</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback... reorients himself, then<br>
    presses on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... no, of course not. Security<br>
    Alert Two, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard to the Bridge,<br>
    Please.</p>

    On my way, Chief.</p>
  <p> Everyone EXITS to...</p>
  <p>33 INT. BRIDGE - PAST - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, Tasha and Troi ENTER. Chief O'Brien is<br>
    standing down in the command area. He hands a PADD to<br>
    Picard. There are N.D. crewmembers milling about on<br>
    the Bridge, working at opened panels... moving portable<br>
    equipment around, etc. The ship is a mess -- clearly,<br>
    not ready for space travel yet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sir, Starfleet has just issued an<br>
    alert. It appears that a number<br>
    of vessels are moving toward the<br>
    Neutral Zone between Romulan and<br>
    Federation space.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What kind of vessels?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Freighters, transports... all<br>
    civilian. None of them Federation<br>
    ships.</p>
  <p> Picard reads the PADD, and as he does, his frown<br>
    deepens -- what he reads rings a bell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off PADD)<br>
    It says a large spatial anomaly<br>
    has appeared in the Neutral<br>
    Zone...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In the Devron System.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts strongly -- this is a younger, more<br>
    outwardly aggressive Worf than the one we're used to<br>
    seeing in the seventh season.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps it is a Romulan trick --<br>
    to lure ships into the Neutral<br>
    Zone as an excuse for a military<br>
    strike.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Tasha, Worf)<br>
    Starfleet's cancelling our mission<br>
    to Farpoint Station and ordering<br>
    us to the Neutral Zone as soon as<br>
    we can leave spacedock.</p>
  <p> Picard considers -- his mind is racing, trying to<br>
    figure out what to do next. He finally makes a<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... no, we'll proceed to<br>
    Farpoint.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 30A.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Shocked reactions.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You heard me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But Captain -- the security of the<br>
    Federation may be at stake!</p>
  <p> Picard calmly looks at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Man your station, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf returns to the aft science station, bristling.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, perhaps if we understood<br>
    your thinking, if you could<br>
    explain --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't intend to explain<br>
    anything...<br>
    (to all)<br>
    ... to anyone. We will proceed to<br>
    Farpoint Station, as originally<br>
    planned.</p>
  <p> A quiet, tense moment on the Bridge... no one moves.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to O'Brien)<br>
    Now, if I'm not mistaken, Chief,<br>
    we're having some problems with<br>
    the warp plasma inducers.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    That's right, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I know a way to get them<br>
    back on-line. You're with me.<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    We'll be in Main Engineering.</p>
  <p> Picard and O'Brien EXIT. Once they leave, people go<br>
    reluctantly back to work. Worf moves closer to Tasha.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quiet, to Tasha)<br>
    I do not understand. The Romulans<br>
    may be planning an attack, and he<br>
    does not seem to care.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are you certain this is the same<br>
    man who commanded the Stargazer?</p>
  <p>STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT THREE32.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    As far as I know.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you going to do?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'm going to do what I'm told....<br>
    prepare to go to Farpoint.</p>
  <p> Worf looks frustrated by her response. As Tasha walks<br>
    across the Bridge, she moves past a WORKMAN, who is<br>
    carrying a plaque toward the bulkhead next to the<br>
    emergency Turbolift. He stops, lifts the ship's<br>
    DEDICATION PLAQUE and begins to hang it on its familiar<br>
    place on the wall...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>34 INT. ENGINEERING - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard is in Geordi's office, sitting at a console,<br>
    O'Brien standing next to him watching as the Captain<br>
    rapidly works the console. Several N.D.s are working<br>
    at various opened consoles and panels -- they're<br>
    getting the ship ready to go.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is somewhat uncomfortable in the presence of<br>
    the new Captain. Picard finishes working and hands<br>
    O'Brien a PADD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister O'Brien, use these<br>
    specifications to bypass the<br>
    secondary plasma inducer.</p>
  <p> O'Brien takes the PADD, concern showing on his face.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You have to realize, sir... this<br>
    isn't exactly my area of<br>
    expertise. The Chief Engineer<br>
    should be making these<br>
    modifications.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the Chief Engineer isn't on<br>
    board yet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister O'Brien... trust me. I<br>
    know you can do this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He smiles at O'Brien, whom he knows well and fondly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All those years you spent as a<br>
    child... building model starship<br>
    engines... were well worth it.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    How'd you know that, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    From... your Starfleet records.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is amazed that this Captain spent time<br>
    scrutinizing the records so thoroughly... but it makes<br>
    him feel more comfortable with this aristocratic man.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes, sir. I'll get right to the<br>
    modifications.</p>
  <p> O'Brien takes the PADD and heads across the room.<br>
    Picard continues to work in Geordi's office. Stay on<br>
    Picard as O'Brien moves offcamera and begins giving<br>
    orders to an offscreen Ensign.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S VOICE<br>
    Fletcher -- tell Munoz and Lee to<br>
    get up here right away. We have<br>
    to realign the entire power grid.<br>
    We're all going to be burning the<br>
    midnight oil on this one.</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    That would be inadvisable.</p>
  <p> At the sound of Data's voice, Picard turns and looks --<br>
    and we now reveal Data, who has just entered the room.<br>
    Through the following conversation, Picard watches with<br>
    a smile as he sees O'Brien encounter Data for the first<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Data looks and acts as he did in the pilot. This is a<br>
    less sophisticated, more naive Data than the one we're<br>
    used to -- he's the Data we knew seven years ago: more<br>
    innocent and less comfortable with everyday human<br>
    interactions.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Excuse me?</p>

    If you attempt to ignite a<br>
    petroleum product on this ship at<br>
    zero-hundred hours -- it will<br>
    activate the fire suppression<br>
    system, which will seal off this<br>
    entire compartment.</p>
  <p> O'Brien looks at him blankly.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sir... that was just an<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> Data reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An expression of what?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (groping)<br>
    A figure of speech... I was trying<br>
    to tell him that... we were going<br>
    to be working late...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah. Then &quot;to burn the midnight<br>
    oil&quot; implies late work?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am curious. What is the<br>
    etymology of that idiom? How did<br>
    it come to be used in contemporary<br>
    language?</p>
  <p> O'Brien isn't sure to what to make of this man.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I... don't know, sir...</p>
  <p> Picard finally comes to O'Brien's rescue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Data, welcome aboard --<br>
    it's good to see you.</p>
  <p> Data turns and sees Picard for the first time. They<br>
    shake hands. Picard smiles at him warmly, genuinely<br>
    glad to see him and have someone he can completely rely<br>
    on. Data isn't sure why this man he has just met is<br>
    smiling so warmly at him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is... good to see you, too,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I could use your help with the<br>
    infusor array.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> They move to a wall panel near the warp core and open<br>
    it. Picard points to a conduit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As you can see, we're having<br>
    difficulty with the plasma<br>
    conduits...</p>

  <p> Data eyes the panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    (beat)<br>
    It appears that we will be<br>
    required to... ignite the midnight<br>
    petroleum, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at him, smiles slightly. Suddenly, we<br>
    hear Beverly's voice --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    Jean-Luc... what's going on?</p>
  <p> Picard turns, and as he does the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>35 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard standing in his bathrobe near the desk. Beverly<br>
    and Riker are standing in the doorway, looking at him,<br>
    puzzled. Picard is momentarily disoriented -- tries to<br>
    orient himself to the here and now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It happened again.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A time shift?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Beverly immediately grabs a tricorder and scans<br>
    Picard's head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's still a little vague, but I<br>
    can remember more this time. I<br>
    think the more I shift between<br>
    time periods, the more memory I<br>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, Troi, Geordi, Beverly. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor, do you remember the<br>
    first day I came aboard the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened after the welcoming<br>
    ceremony?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There was a reception in Ten<br>
    Forward... I introduced you to<br>
    Worf and the other senior<br>
    officers...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any memory of me<br>
    calling for a Red Alert in<br>
    spacedock? Do you remember<br>
    Starfleet diverting us from<br>
    Farpoint to the Neutral Zone to<br>
    investigate a spatial anomaly?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> They consider this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would appear that there is a<br>
    discontinuity between the time<br>
    periods you have described.<br>
    Events in one time period would<br>
    seem to have no effect on the<br>
    other two.</p>
  <p> They try to make sense of this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And yet in both the past and the<br>
    present -- there's a report of the<br>
    same anomaly in the Devron System.<br>
    It's hard to believe that's a<br>
    coincidence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For all I know, there may be one<br>
    in the future, too.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe the anomaly is some kind<br>
    of... temporal disruption.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    But how is all this related to<br>
    your time shifting?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These are good questions. And I<br>
    suspect I might find some answers<br>
    when I return to the past... but<br>
    for now we're facing a potentially<br>
    dangerous threat from the<br>
    Romulans.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All departments should submit<br>
    combat readiness reports by oh<br>
    eight hundred hours tomorrow.<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Everyone rises to go and heads for the door. Riker<br>
    catches Troi's attention.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Looks like it's going to be a late<br>
    night... want to get some dinner<br>
    first?</p>
  <p> Troi hesitates, glances at Worf. There's an awkward<br>
    moment. Riker looks a little puzzled, not sure what's<br>
    going on.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually, I...<br>
    (re: Worf)<br>
    I mean... we have plans.</p>
  <p> And in that moment, Riker suddenly realizes that Troi<br>
    and Worf's relationship has progressed further than he<br>
    ever realized. He's caught off-guard here, but tries<br>
    to respond casually and naturally.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh... I see. Well then... see you<br>
    tomorrow morning.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Goodnight, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi EXIT to the corridor. Riker looks after<br>
    them once they've gone. Clearly, the scene has<br>
    disturbed him -- he's not sure how he feels about this.<br>
    Finally, he turns and EXITS to the Bridge...</p>
  <p>37 INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS. Beverly is standing near the aft<br>
    console, watching Picard as he gives Data orders. The<br>
    ship is at Yellow Alert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    ... and I want continuous subspace<br>
    sweeps. We might detect a<br>
    temporal disturbance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard move toward the Command area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wil... this time shifting... when<br>
    it happens, I experience a moment<br>
    of disorientation. If this should<br>
    happen during a crisis, I want you<br>
    to be ready to take command<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Riker is still distracted by what just happened with<br>
    Worf and Troi. He doesn't respond right away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry, Captain. Be prepared to<br>
    take command. Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him, notes his distraction.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Speaking of disorientation... are<br>
    you all right?</p>
  <p> Riker tries to shrug it off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just a little distracted. I'm<br>
    fine.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't quite believe this, but decides not to<br>
    pursue the matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the Bridge. I'll be in<br>
    my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> Riker moves to sit down as Picard heads for the Ready<br>
    Room.</p>
  <p>38 ANGLE ON BEVERLY</p>
  <p> She watches Picard exit, a look of concern on her face.<br>
    OFF her expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>39 INT. READY ROOM - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard sitting at his desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Beverly ENTERS, walks directly to the replicator.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to replicator)<br>
    Milk, warm -- dash of nutmeg.</p>
  <p> We HEAR the replicator work. Beverly takes a way a<br>
    glass of milk and hands it to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's this?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A prescription. A glass of warm<br>
    milk and eight hours uninterrupted<br>
    sleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Doctor's orders. You're<br>
    exhausted. I don't know if you've<br>
    slept in the past or the future...<br>
    but I know you haven't slept in<br>
    the present.<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Get some rest, or I'll have you<br>
    relieved and sedated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> They exchange a smile. Beverly puts her hand on his in<br>
    a friendly gesture, but then leaves it there a beat<br>
    longer then necessary, and gives it a little squeeze.<br>
    She looks concerned. He looks up at her with a little<br>
    bit of surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks, and for a moment, it seems as if she<br>
    might say something... but she decides against it...<br>
    she turns and heads for the door. Picard stands up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> She stops, takes a moment, then finally turns around<br>
    and looks at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As a physician, it's often my job<br>
    to give people unpleasant news...<br>
    to tell them that they need<br>
    surgery or that they can't have<br>
    children...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Or that they might be facing a<br>
    difficult illness...</p>
  <p> She breaks off, looks away from him. Picard moves to<br>
    her, touched by her concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said yourself it's only a<br>
    possibility.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But you've been to the future...<br>
    you know it's going to happen.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat, then looks up at her again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I prefer to think of the future as<br>
    something that is not written in<br>
    stone. A lot of things can happen<br>
    in twenty-five years.</p>
  <p> She looks at him for a moment, smiles... then leans<br>
    over and kisses him on the lips. They pull apart after<br>
    a beat. She looks into his eyes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    A lot of things can happen.</p>
  <p> Beverly turns and EXITS. Picard watches her go, a<br>
    thoughtful look on his face... then he picks up the<br>
    glass of milk and takes a sip... moves to the couch and<br>
    stretches out. He's exhausted. He closes his eyes...<br>
    his breathing deepens... he begins to drift off...</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    Sir? Wake up... sir?</p>
  <p> The SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>40 INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - LATE AFTERNOON</p>
  <p> Geordi is gently waking Picard, who is sleeping on<br>
    Data's sofa. Picard blinks open his eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... yes, what is it? Have we<br>
    reached the Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> Picard looks around, realizing what time period he's<br>
    in...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry... I was... in the past<br>
    again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data's arranged for us to run some<br>
    tests on you in the bio-metrics<br>
    lab. We're ready to go if you<br>
    are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No... no, we don't have time for<br>
    that. We have to get to the<br>
    Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the other two time periods...<br>
    Starfleet reported a... uh... some<br>
    kind of... spatial anomaly in<br>
    the... in the...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... in the Devron System! The<br>
    Devron System in the Neutral Zone!</p>
  <p> Geordi sighs -- the old man's ravings are starting to<br>
    get a little out of hand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinking)<br>
    If the anomaly was in the past...<br>
    it might be here, too. We have to<br>
    go find out...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just because you've seen it in two<br>
    other time frames, doesn't mean<br>
    it's going to be here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But if it is -- that means<br>
    something! Damnit, Geordi -- I<br>
    know what we have to do!</p>
  <p> Geordi puts aside his own frustration.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... but first of all, there is<br>
    no Neutral Zone, remember?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (struggling)<br>
    Right... right. Klingons... in<br>
    this time period, the Klingons<br>
    have taken over the Romulan<br>
    Empire...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And the relations between us and<br>
    the Klingons aren't real cozy<br>
    right now.</p>
  <p> Picard struggles to his feet, irritated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know that. I haven't completely<br>
    lost my mind, you know.</p>
  <p> Picard pulls up short at his own tone, tries to take<br>
    the edge out of his voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Sorry, Geordi... it's hard for me<br>
    to concentrate... and remember<br>
    things... I don't mean to take<br>
    out that frustration on you...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's okay...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well, if we're going to the Devron<br>
    System, we're going to need a<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it's time to call in some<br>
    old favors...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Contact Admiral Riker at Starbase<br>
    Two-four-seven.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>41 EXT. CAMBRIDGE - FUTURE - LATE AFTERNOON (MATTE)</p>
  <p> As seen earlier.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>42 INT. DATA'S LIBRARY - FUTURE - LATE AFTERNOON<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A short time later. Where the hearth and fire were<br>
    seen earlier there is now a large VIEWSCREEN and a<br>
    computer console. Picard is talking to Admiral Riker<br>
    on the viewer.</p>
  <p> Riker is twenty-five years older, his hair almost<br>
    completely gray. His attitude is now that of a<br>
    seasoned and experienced Starfleet Admiral... but<br>
    there's something more. He's more brittle, less easygoing<br>
    than the Riker we used to know... something's<br>
    changed in him.</p>
  <p> He regards Picard fondly but with a hint of tolerance.<br>
    The power relationships have changed here -- while<br>
    Riker respects Picard he is no longer beholden to him.<br>
    Mid-conversation. Data and Geordi are standing nearby.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Jean-Luc, you know I'd like to<br>
    help... but frankly, what you're<br>
    asking for is impossible. The<br>
    Klingons have closed their borders<br>
    to all Federation starships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wil... if this... spatial anomaly<br>
    really is in the Devron System...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I saw a report from Starfleet<br>
    Intelligence on that sector this<br>
    morning. There's no activity...<br>
    there's nothing unusual happening<br>
    in the Devron System.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't believe that! Maybe their<br>
    long-range scanners are flawed...<br>
    we have to go there, see for<br>
    ourselves!</p>
  <p> Riker is reluctant to turn him down flat... he looks<br>
    for a way to ease out of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, what do you make of all<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> Data considers. He no longer makes decisions based<br>
    purely on logic, but compassionately takes feelings<br>
    into account, too.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT FOUR 45A.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not certain. I cannot<br>
    disprove what the Captain is<br>
    saying.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And he is convinced he is<br>
    travelling back and forth through<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes him. Clearly Data is siding with the<br>
    Captain. Riker feels he has to do something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Look, I've got the Yorktown out<br>
    near the border... I'll have them<br>
    run some long range scans of the<br>
    Devron System... if they find<br>
    anything, I'll let you know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not good enough.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (firm)<br>
    It's going to have to be. I'm<br>
    sorry. That's all I can do.<br>
    Riker out.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS. Picard steps back from the<br>
    Viewscreen, frustrated and angry. Data turns to the<br>
    computer console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- restore holographic<br>
    image.</p>
  <p> The Viewscreen and computer console VANISH and are<br>
    REPLACED by the fireplace and roaring fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Damn him anyway... after all we've<br>
    been through together... he's been<br>
    sitting behind that desk too long.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... I guess all we can do is<br>
    wait to see if the Yorktown finds<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is another option.</p>
  <p> Picard looks hopeful, but Geordi is exasperated -- he<br>
    was hoping that Riker had put an end to all this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We could arrange passage aboard a<br>
    medical ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Medical ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. There was an outbreak of<br>
    Terrellian Plague on Romulus. The<br>
    Klingons have been allowing<br>
    Federation medical ships to cross<br>
    the border.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (excited)<br>
    Yes... yes...</p>
  <p> Geordi is a little chagrinned, but opts not to fight<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (resigned)<br>
    So now all we need is a medical<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I can arrange that.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Find the USS Pasteur. I have some<br>
    pull with the Captain.<br>
    (beat, then concerned)<br>
    At least, I used to...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>43 EXT. SPACE - MEDICAL SHIP - FUTURE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A small and sleek VESSEL with the 24th century<br>
    equivalent of &quot;Red Cross&quot; markings. The ship is<br>
    orbiting Earth.</p>
  <p>44 INT. MEDICAL SHIP - BRIDGE - FUTURE</p>
  <p> The Bridge of a futuristic medical ship. Picard,<br>
    Geordi and Data (who's now dressed in travel clothes)<br>
    ENTER from a Turbolift. ENSIGN CHILTON is at the Conn.<br>
    Someone is sitting in the Captain's chair and is turned<br>
    away from them. The chair swivels to face them and we<br>
    REVEAL --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Captain Beverly Picard. She smiles and rises.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... this is a page out of the<br>
    past. I never thought I'd see any<br>
    one of you on a starship again.<br>
    (shaking hands)<br>
    Data, Geordi...</p>
  <p> There is an awkward beat as Beverly and Picard look at<br>
    each other -- there is a tension in the air. At the<br>
    exact same moment, Beverly moves to hug him, but Picard<br>
    holds out his hand to shake hers. Then they both see<br>
    what the other is doing, and they switch -- Beverly<br>
    starts to shake his hand and Picard moves to hug her.<br>
    They both finally drop their hands and smile at each<br>
    other, embarrassed and amused at their own awkwardness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's just... choose one.</p>
  <p> They move toward each other and gently hug for a<br>
    moment. There is a tenderness between them... then<br>
    they separate and there's the awkwardness again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. Did you get my message?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. Jean-Luc... going into<br>
    Klingon territory -- it's insane.<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    But I never could say no to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah. So that's why you married me.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him. These are two people who still<br>
    retain a fondness for each other in spite of not having<br>
    been able to make marriage work.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now... the first order of business<br>
    is to get clearance to cross the<br>
    Klingon border.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What about Worf? Isn't he still<br>
    on the Klingon High Council?</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I'm not sure. Information on the<br>
    Klingon political structure is<br>
    hard to come by these days.<br>
    However, at last report Worf was<br>
    governor of H'atoria, a small<br>
    Klingon colony near the border.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf... yes, that's it... that's<br>
    the answer. Worf. He'll help us.<br>
    Let's make it so.</p>
  <p> As Beverly considers this --</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Yes?</p>
  <p> They give each other a look. Chilton addresses<br>
    Beverly.</p>
  <p> CHILTON<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain, McKinley Station is<br>
    signalling. They want to know<br>
    when we'll be docking.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Tell McKinley that we've been<br>
    called away on a priority mission.<br>
    We won't be docking.</p>
  <p> CHILTON<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at Beverly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kept the name, eh?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    I've prepared quarters for you on<br>
    Deck Five if you'd like some rest.</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm fine. I don't need any rest.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Chilton)<br>
    Nell, please escort the Ambassador<br>
    to his quarters--</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can find my way around a<br>
    starship!</p>
  <p> Picard addresses the group, building a head of steam.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're all treating me like an<br>
    invalid, but I assure you I've got<br>
    a few years left. I don't need to<br>
    be led around and I don't want to<br>
    be patronized.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're right. I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Disarmed, he starts for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll go have a rest.</p>
  <p> The doors close behind him. Once he's gone, Beverly<br>
    turns to Geordi and Data with a slightly sad<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How long since he's had a<br>
    neurological scan?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure, but don't waste your<br>
    time suggesting it. He says he's<br>
    not taking &quot;any more damn tests.&quot;</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you believe he's moving through<br>
    time?</p>

  <p> Geordi looks down -- it's clear he doesn't believe the<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't know if I do, either...<br>
    but -- he's Jean-Luc Picard. And<br>
    if he wants to go on one more<br>
    mission, that's what we're going<br>
    to do.</p>

  <p> The Lift stops. The doors open and Picard steps out.<br>
    And as he does, the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>46 INT. BRIDGE - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard walking out of a Turbolift onto the Bridge. He<br>
    hesitates only for a moment, quickly orienting himself.<br>
    He moves to the Command Area. Tasha, Worf, O'Brien,<br>
    Data and Troi at their stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Is there anything unusual in the<br>
    vicinity?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How would you define unusual, sir?<br>
    Every region of space has unique<br>
    properties that cannot be found<br>
    anywhere else.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks, remembers what happened originally.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There should be a... &quot;barrier&quot; of<br>
    some sort nearby. A large plasma<br>
    field... highly disruptive.</p>
  <p> Tasha works.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> Frustrated, Picard looks down at O'Brien's console<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's the right time... right<br>
    place... he should be here...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Who, sir?</p>
  <p> Picard straightens up and looks around the Bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calls out)<br>
    Q! We're here! This has gone on<br>
    long enough! What sort of game<br>
    are you playing?</p>
  <p> There is no answer. The Bridge crew exchange looks<br>
    among themselves -- they're definitely starting to<br>
    wonder about this guy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, to Troi)<br>
    Counselor, do you sense an alien<br>

    (quiet)<br>
    This is not the way it's supposed<br>
    to happen...<br>
    (to all)<br>
    Maintain position here. I'll be<br>

  <p> Picard EXITS to the Ready Room...</p>

  <p> As Picard steps through the doors, the SCENE CHANGES<br>
    TO:</p>
  <p>50 INT. COURTROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is suddenly in front of the screaming crowd, as<br>
    seen in &quot;Farpoint&quot;. The crowd is looking down the<br>
    hallway that leads into the courtroom. Out of the<br>
    darkness, riding on his FLOATING CHAIR -- Q appears,<br>
    dressed in his judge's robes. The crowd ROARS in<br>
    approval at the sight of him. Q holds up a hand and<br>
    they fall silent. He looks toward Picard.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Mon Capitan... I thought you'd<br>
    never get here.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>51 INT. COURTROOM</p>
  <p> Picard facing Q, as before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q... I thought so. What's going<br>
    on?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It's Judge Q to you. And isn't it<br>
    obvious what's going on?</p>
  <p> Picard looks around at the courtroom, the unruly crowd.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The last time I stood in this<br>
    courtroom was seven years ago...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    &quot;Seven years ago... &quot; How little<br>
    you mortals understand time. Must<br>
    you be so linear, Jean-Luc?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (doggedly)<br>
    You accused me of being the<br>
    representative of a barbarous<br>
    species...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I believe my exact words were &quot;a<br>
    dangerous, savage, child-race.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But we demonstrated that mankind<br>
    has become peaceful and<br>
    benevolent. You agreed, and let<br>
    us go on our way.<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    Why do I find myself back in this<br>
    courtroom?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You'd like me to connect the dots<br>
    for you. Lead you from A... to<br>
    B... to C... so your puny mind<br>
    can comprehend.</p>
  <p> Q shakes his head wearily, vexed by man's limitations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/25/94 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    How boring. They would be so much<br>
    more entertained if you tried to<br>
    figure this out...</p>
  <p> Q thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll answer any ten questions that<br>
    call for a &quot;yes&quot; or a &quot;no.&quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath, looks around the courtroom<br>
    again. This is the only way he can get information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you putting mankind on trial<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any connection at all<br>
    between the trial seven years<br>
    ago... and whatever's going on<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Hmmmmm... I would have to say...<br>
    yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/25/94 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The spatial anomaly in the Neutral<br>
    Zone -- is it related to what's<br>
    happening?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, most definitely yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it part of a Romulan plot? A<br>
    ploy to start a war?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No... and no. Five down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's only four --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (ticking on his fingers)<br>
    &quot;Is it a Romulan plot?&quot; &quot;Is it a<br>
    ploy to start a war?&quot; Those are<br>
    separate questions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you create the anomaly?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (laughs merrily)<br>
    No, no, no. You're going to be so<br>
    surprised when you realize where<br>
    it came from -- if you ever figure<br>
    it out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (trying another tack)<br>
    Are you responsible for my<br>
    shifting through time?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/28/94 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I'll answer that if you promise<br>
    you won't tell anyone.<br>
    (whispering)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a &quot;yes<br>
    or no&quot; question. You forfeit the<br>
    rest of your questions.</p>
  <p> He regards Picard with scorn.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I expected as much. You're such<br>
    a limited creature... a perfect<br>
    example of why we've made our<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> Picard gives him a questioning look.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The trial never ended, Captain.<br>
    We never reached a verdict. But,<br>
    now we have: you're guilty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guilty of what?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Of being inferior.</p>
  <p> Q looks at Picard with unconcealed contempt.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Seven years ago I said we'd be<br>
    watching you. And we have been.<br>
    Hoping your ape-like race would<br>
    demonstrate some growth... give<br>
    some indication that your minds<br>
    have room for expansion.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/29/94 - ACT FIVE 56B.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Q's tone now is serious, threatening.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And what have we seen instead?<br>
    You spending time worrying about<br>
    Commander Riker's career...<br>
    listening to Counselor Troi's<br>
    pedantic psychobabble...<br>
    indulging Data in his witless<br>
    exploration of humanity...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have journeyed to countless new<br>
    worlds... made contact with new<br>
    species... expanded man's<br>
    understanding of the universe...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    In your own paltry, limited way.<br>
    You have no idea how far you still<br>
    have to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are what we are, Q -- and we're<br>
    doing the best we can. It's not<br>
    for you to set the standard by<br>
    which we're judged.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Oh, but it is. And we have. Time<br>
    may be eternal -- but our patience<br>
    is not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (tight)<br>
    Having rendered a verdict... have<br>
    you decided upon a sentence?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Indeed. It's time to put an end<br>
    to your trek through the stars...<br>
    to make room for other, more<br>
    worthy species.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're to be denied travel through<br>
    space?</p>

  <p>51 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q... even you could not be capable<br>
    of such an act --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I? There you go again, blaming me<br>
    for everything. Well, this time<br>
    I'm not your enemy. I am not the<br>
    one who causes the annihilation of<br>
    mankind.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 03/21/94 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    That's right. You're doing it<br>
    right now... you've already done<br>
    it... and you will do it yet<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What sort of meaningless doubletalk<br>
    is that?</p>
  <p> Q sighs.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    He doesn't understand. I have<br>
    only myself to blame, I suppose.<br>
    I believed in you... I thought you<br>
    had potential... but apparently I<br>
    was wrong.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    May whatever God you believe in<br>
    have mercy on your soul. This<br>
    court stands adjourned.</p>
  <p> Q raises a hand and there is the crash of a GONG. The<br>
    SCENE CHANGES TO::</p>
  <p>52 INT. READY ROOM - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard sits up on the couch suddenly, the SOUND of the<br>
    gong slowly fading away. He realizes what's happened.</p>
  <p> He heads for the door of the Ready Room and EXITS to<br>
    the Bridge.</p>
  <p>52A INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard steps onto the Bridge and addresses Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Commander, assemble the Senior<br>
    Staff and go to Red Alert.<br>

  <p>54 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi, Beverly, Troi. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't believe him. This has to<br>
    be another one of Q's games. He's<br>
    probably listening to us right<br>
    now, getting a big laugh out of<br>
    watching us jump through his<br>
    hoops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think that this time, we have no<br>
    choice but to take him at his<br>
    word... which means that in some<br>
    fashion, I will cause the<br>
    destruction of humanity.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But didn't Q say you already had<br>
    caused it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And that you were causing it<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Given the fact that there is an<br>
    apparent discontinuity between the<br>
    three time periods the Captain is<br>
    visiting, Q's statement may be<br>
    accurate, if confusing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT SIX 59.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard looks frustrated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So what should I do -- just lock<br>
    myself in a room in all three time<br>
    periods?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. Maybe not acting is what<br>
    causes the destruction of mankind.<br>
    What if you were needed on the<br>
    Bridge at a key moment, and<br>
    weren't there?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We can't start second-guessing<br>
    ourselves. I think we have to<br>
    proceed normally... deal with each<br>
    situation as it occurs...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've been thinking about my<br>
    conversation with Q. He admitted<br>
    that he was responsible for my<br>
    shifting through time...</p>
  <p> The others listen carefully, wondering where the<br>
    Captain is going with this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It occurred to me... that perhaps<br>
    Q is giving me a chance to save<br>
    mankind somehow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT SIX 60.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Astonished looks all around.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What makes you say that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q has always shown a certain...<br>
    fascination with humanity... and<br>
    specifically with me. I think he<br>
    has more than a casual interest in<br>
    what happens to me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is true. Q's interest in you<br>
    is very similar to that of a<br>
    master and a beloved pet.</p>
  <p> Picard shoots him a dirty look.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That was only an analogy, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I weren't traveling through<br>
    time... I would never have<br>
    realized that the anomaly in the<br>
    Neutral Zone appeared there in the<br>
    past as well.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Assuming that's an important piece<br>
    of a larger puzzle, my ability to<br>
    shift through time may be the key<br>
    to understanding what's going on.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can't you at least grant us<br>
    permission to cross the border?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I must refuse. It is for your own<br>
    safety -- the Neutral Zone is<br>
    extremely volatile.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If Admiral Riker had given you a<br>
    starship with a cloak, you would<br>
    have been safe. I cannot believe<br>
    he refused to help you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't care what kind of ship<br>
    we're in -- the important thing is<br>
    to get to the Devron System --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am sorry, but my first duty is<br>
    to the Empire. I must adhere to<br>
    regulations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe I'm just an old man who<br>
    doesn't understand... but the Worf<br>
    I knew cared more about things<br>
    like loyalty and honor than he did<br>
    rules and regulations.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But then, that was a long time<br>
    ago. Maybe you're not the Worf I<br>
    knew.</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly explodes in a fit of rage. He throws<br>
    everything off his desk with a powerful sweep of his<br>
    arm.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (a curse)<br>
    Dor-sHo GHA!</p>
  <p> His eyes flash and he points an accusatory finger<br>
    toward Picard.</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have always used your<br>
    knowledge of Klingon honor and<br>
    tradition to get what you want<br>
    from me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (right back at him)<br>
    That's because it always works.<br>
    Your problem, Worf, is that you<br>
    really do have a sense of honor...<br>
    you really do care about things<br>
    like loyalty and trust. Don't<br>
    blame me because I know you too<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> Worf glares at him... then --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Very well. You may cross the<br>
    border. But only if I come with<br>
    you. I am familiar with the<br>
    Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at him.</p>

  <p> Beverly turns to Picard with a serious look on her<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I just want to make one thing<br>
    clear, Jean-Luc. If we run into<br>
    any serious opposition, I'm taking<br>
    us back to Federation territory.<br>
    We aren't well armed and we<br>
    wouldn't last long in a fight.</p>

  <p> She raises her hand to give the order to engage, then<br>
    pauses for a moment... looks to Picard and smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Once more, for old time's sake?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles, knowing exactly what she means. He<br>
    raises his hand in the old familiar way, and then the<br>
    SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>

    Engage.</p>
  <p> O'Brien turns around in his chair, a little confused.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Engage to where, sir?</p>
  <p> Picard glances around, quickly orients himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set course for the Devron System,<br>
    and engage at warp nine.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    The Devron System is inside the<br>
    Neutral Zone, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of that, Lieutenant.<br>

    Captain... may I have a word with<br>
    you in private?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (to Tasha)<br>
    Lieutenant, contact Farpoint<br>

    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> They stand and head for the Ready Room...</p>
  <p>59 INT. READY ROOM - PAST - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi ENTER.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I just want to voice my<br>
    concerns about the way the crew is<br>
    responding to your... unexpected<br>
    orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They don't trust me... they think<br>
    I'm behaving erratically.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Some do... others are confused...<br>
    it takes some time for a new crew<br>
    to get to know their Captain, and<br>
    for him to know them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand that. But I know<br>
    what this crew is capable of, even<br>
    if they don't.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm happy to hear you say that.<br>
    It may do them good to hear it, as<br>
    well...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It would also help if they knew<br>
    what was going on.</p>

  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know it's difficult operating in<br>
    the dark, Counselor. But for now,<br>
    I think it's the only choice.</p>
  <p> Troi looks a little unconvinced.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps if you could at least<br>
    indicate why --</p>
  <p> TASHA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yar to Captain Picard. I have<br>
    Commander Riker for you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put him through in here.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts to Riker's name -- and we see that this is<br>
    a Troi who has not resolved her feelings about Riker.<br>
    Picard sits down at the desk and activates the desktop<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander. I just wanted to let<br>
    you know we'll be delayed in<br>
    picking you up at Farpoint<br>
    Station.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I see. May I ask how long?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure. I'll keep you<br>
    updated. Please inform Doctor<br>
    Crusher and Lieutenant La Forge of<br>

  <p>63 RESUME</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there anything else, Counselor?</p>
  <p> Troi doesn't answer right away -- something is clearly<br>
    troubling her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually... there is, sir. I've<br>
    been debating whether or not to<br>
    mention it... but perhaps...<br>
    (becomes more resolute)<br>
    It's about Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Picard, of course, knows all about their<br>
    relationship... he even knows how it will run its<br>
    course in the future. But he plays it out as if this<br>
    is the first he's heard of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... I think you should know<br>
    that we... have had a prior<br>
    relationship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Do you anticipate this<br>
    interfering with your duties?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, sir. It was several years<br>
    ago. And it's well behind us<br>
    both. But I thought you should<br>
    know...</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate your telling me...<br>
    but I'm sure the two of you will<br>
    find a way to... deal with the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT SIX 68.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard says this with confidence... but Troi isn't so<br>
    sure. Picard moves to the replicator.</p>

    Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    That beverage has not been<br>
    programmed into the replication<br>

  <p> Picard reacts. He turns to Troi with a smile, as if to<br>
    make a remark... and as he does, the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>64 INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard standing in front of the Viewscreen. TOMALAK,<br>
    the Romulan Commander, is on the viewer.</p>
  <p> TOMOLAK<br>
    So Captain... how long shall we<br>
    stare at each other across the<br>
    Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is another alternative,<br>
    Tomolak. We're both here for the<br>
    same reason. We could each send<br>
    one ship into the Neutral Zone to<br>
    investigate the anomaly in the<br>
    Devron System.</p>
  <p> Tomolak considers this.</p>
  <p> TOMOLAK<br>
    Has Starfleet Command approved<br>
    this arrangement?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> TOMOLAK<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I like it already.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Agreed. One ship from each<br>
    side... but I warn you -- if<br>
    another Federation starship tries<br>
    to enter the Zone...</p>

    All stop. On screen.</p>
  <p> The Viewscreen now shows the SPATIAL ANOMALY -- a large<br>
    mass of color and light. There is an ethereal quality<br>
    to the Anomaly... it's beautiful and frightening all<br>
    at once. They all react to the sight.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    All stop. Put it onscreen.</p>
  <p> The Viewscreen now shows the distinctive SPATIAL<br>
    ANOMALY as seen before. But this time, it's much<br>

  <p> A few minutes later. Beverly looking over Data's<br>
    shoulder at the aft science station. Picard nearby.<br>
    Chilton at Con. Worf is working at nearby console.<br>
    Geordi looking on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Still nothing, Captain. I've<br>
    conducted a full sensor sweep out<br>
    to one light year from the<br>
    Pasteur. No temporal anomalies,<br>
    no particle fluctuations...<br>
    nothing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you scanned the entire<br>
    subspace bandwidth?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes. The subspace barrier is a<br>
    little thin in this region of<br>
    space, but that's not unusual.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand. I've already<br>
    seen it in the other two -- the<br>
    other two time periods. Why isn't<br>
    it here?</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly looks up from his console with concern.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Captain. I have been monitoring<br>
    Klingon communication channels...<br>
    several warships have been<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, there must be some other way<br>
    to scan for temporal<br>
    disturbances... something that's<br>
    not covered in a normal sensor<br>
    sweep.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are several methods of<br>
    detecting temporal disturbances,<br>
    but we're limited by the equipment<br>
    on the Pasteur. This ship is<br>
    designed primarily for medical<br>
    emergencies.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc, we've done all we can...<br>
    we should head back to Federation<br>
    territory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (still thinking)<br>
    However, it may be possible to<br>
    modify the main deflector to emit<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    To make the modifications and<br>

  <p> CHILTON<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    What help?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You aren't alone, you know... what<br>
    you were... and what you will<br>
    become... are always with you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My time shifting... the answer<br>
    does lie there...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Just tell me one thing... this<br>
    anomaly we're looking for... is<br>
    that what destroys humanity?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You're forgetting, Jean-Luc. You<br>
    destroy humanity.</p>

    By doing what? When? How are you --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>73 INT. BRIDGE - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard standing near the Ops station, leaning on the<br>
    same cane we just saw in Q's hand. Riker and Worf at<br>
    stations. Picard glances at the cane and tosses it<br>
    aside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Report, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The anomaly is two hundred million<br>
    kilometers in diameter. It is a<br>
    highly focused temporal energy<br>
    source which is emitting<br>
    approximately the same energy<br>
    output as ten G-type stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is the source of that energy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am uncertain. Sensors have been<br>
    unable to penetrate the anomaly.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks, remembers something from the future time<br>
    period.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 3/11/94 - ACT SEVEN 78.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if we modified the main<br>
    deflector to emit an... inverse<br>
    tachyon pulse. That might scan<br>
    beyond the subspace barrier...<br>
    give us an idea what the interior<br>
    of this thing looks like.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment, a little surprised.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is a most intriguing idea,<br>
    Captain. I do not believe a<br>
    tachyon beam was ever put to such<br>
    use. I had no idea you were so<br>
    versed in the intricacies of<br>
    temporal theory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have some friends who are quite<br>
    well versed in the matter. Make<br>
    it so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data stands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe we can make the<br>
    necessary modifications in Main<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. As Data heads for the door...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>74 INT. ENGINEERING - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Later. Data and Geordi working at consoles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can get more power if we reroute<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Data works.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    It will take the computer some<br>
    time to give us a complete picture<br>

  <p> Geordi reacts to a sudden stab of pain in his VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Whoa...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What is wrong?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    somebody put an ice pick through<br>
    my temples...<br>

  <p>77 INT. SICKBAY - PRESENT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A while later. Geordi sitting on a bio-bed with his<br>
    VISOR off.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard are looking at Geordi's eyes.<br>
    They're not as they usually appear; the iris shows<br>
    faintly. Data is working on a monitor in the b.g.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Look at his eyes... you can see<br>
    the difference yourself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (peering)<br>
    Yes... I can see the iris...</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a scanning DEVICE and scans his eyes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off scanner)<br>
    This is amazing. The DNA in his<br>
    optic nerves is being<br>
    regenerated...</p>
  <p> She lowers the device and looks at Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's as if he were growing new<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess that's why I started to<br>
    feel pain... my optical cortex was<br>
    falling out of alignment with my<br>
    VISOR.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is this possible?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It shouldn't be possible at all.<br>
    There's no medical explanation for<br>
    the spontaneous regeneration of an<br>
    organ.</p>

    Doctor... we've just gotten<br>

  <p> Picard reacts to this bizarre news. Data looks up from<br>
    his monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I may have a partial<br>
    explanation, Captain.</p>
  <p> They move to where he is working. The monitor shows a<br>
    complex Okudagram of the ANOMALY with various pieces of<br>
    sensor information.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/14/94 - ACT SEVEN 81.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have completed my analysis of<br>
    the anomaly. It appears to be a<br>
    multi-phasic temporal convergence<br>
    in the space-time continuum.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In English please.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is, in essence, an eruption<br>
    of... anti-time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anti-time?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A relatively new concept in<br>
    temporal mechanics. The<br>
    relationship of anti-time to<br>
    normal time is analogous to the<br>
    relationship of anti-matter to<br>
    normal matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    So if time and anti-time were to<br>
    collide...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They would annihilate each<br>
    other... creating a rupture in<br>
    space. I believe this is what has<br>
    happened in the Devron System.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/15/94 - ACT SEVEN 82.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The rupture may be sending out<br>
    waves of temporal energy which are<br>
    disrupting the normal flow of<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then it's possible the DNA<br>
    molecules in Geordi's optic nerves<br>
    aren't regenerating themselves...<br>
    They might be reverting to their<br>
    original state.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You mean his eyes are getting...<br>
    younger?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For all intents and purposes, yes.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So the temporal anomaly has<br>
    certain... rejuvenating effects.<br>
    It certainly doesn't sound like<br>
    the destruction of humanity.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Data, what could have caused this<br>
    collision between time and anti-time?</p>
  <p>78 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> Who is sitting in his chair at Ops, looking confused.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Anti-time, sir?</p>
  <p> MOVE TO REVEAL WE'RE IN:</p>
  <p>79 INT. BRIDGE - PAST</p>
  <p> Picard is standing on the Bridge, talking to Data.<br>
    Picard quickly moves to Data's console and begins<br>
    entering information rapidly. Tasha, Worf, O'Brien and<br>
    Troi at their stations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT SEVEN 82A.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I believe that if we modify the<br>
    deflector to send out an inverse<br>
    tachyon pulse, you'll find that<br>
    the anomaly is a rupture between<br>
    time and anti-time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 3/11/94 - ACT SEVEN 83.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data watches Picard work the console for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is a fascinating<br>
    hypothesis... how did you<br>
    formulate --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would take too long to explain.<br>
    Begin the modifications and send<br>
    out the pulse. Once you've done<br>
    that, start working on a theory as<br>
    to what could have caused this<br>
    rupture.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data begins working. Picard thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister O'Brien... how big is the<br>
    anomaly?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (works)<br>
    Approximately four hundred million<br>
    kilometers in diameter, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I still don't understand why it's<br>
    larger here...</p>
  <p> O'Brien gives him a puzzled look -- he doesn't know<br>
    what the hell Picard is talking about, but decides not<br>
    to pursue it. Worf suddenly reacts to something on the<br>
    aft console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... there are five<br>

    ever since we entered the Neutral<br>
    Zone. I'm glad to see you're here<br>
    to protect us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why have you come here?</p>
  <p> Androna's expression brightens a little.</p>
  <p> ANDRONA<br>
    We heard about the Light... from<br>
    a merchant ship who told us about<br>
    the power it has to heal<br>
    illness... to rejuvenate the<br>
    elderly... and we had to come<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> The others on the Bridge look a little confused...<br>
    they've never heard about any of this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can't really be certain that<br>
    the... Light... has this power.<br>
    And there may be dangers, side<br>
    effects we're not aware of...</p>

  <p> ANDRONA<br>
    I have five ships full of sick and<br>
    dying people, Captain. If there's<br>
    even a chance it's true, I can't<br>
    turn back now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be safer for all<br>
    concerned if you left the Neutral<br>
    Zone... and let us investigate the<br>
    phenomenon more fully.</p>
  <p> ANDRONA<br>
    No. I've come too far.</p>
  <p> Picard is frustrated, but has no authority to order<br>
    them away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I warn you that if the Romulans<br>
    should decide to intervene, I may<br>
    not be able to protect you.</p>
  <p> ANDRONA<br>
    I understand. We'll take that<br>
    risk.<br>

  <p> Picard steps in before this can escalate any further.</p>

  <p> Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right. Let's get out of here.</p>

    No... we can't... we have to save<br>

    Our cloak isn't functioning. We<br>

    We'll have to do this the old-fashioned<br>
    way. Lay in a course<br>
    back to the Federation. Warp<br>

  <p> Picard reacts strongly to this. As he argues with<br>
    Riker, we see Beverly move to a COMPARTMENT in the b.g.<br>
    and take out a medical kit... prepare a hypospray...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Wil, don't leave! We have to stay<br>
    here -- find the cause of the<br>
    temporal anomaly...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we can't stay...</p>
  <p> Picard is frantic to convince Riker to stay -- but his<br>
    mental condition is getting worse and his desperation<br>
    sounds almost like hysteria.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have to! Everything depends on<br>
    this! We can't leave now --<br>
    please listen to me!</p>
  <p> Beverly moves up behind him and applies the hypospray.<br>
    And as Picard collapses into Riker's arms, the SCENE<br>
    CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>90 INT. CORRIDOR - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard nearly bumps into a crewman as he turns a<br>
    corner. He hesitates for a moment, then continues<br>
    walking towards Sickbay...</p>
  <p>91 INT. SICKBAY - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. Beverly is tending to Ogawa, who is<br>
    lying on a bio-bed. Ogawa is wearing a patient's gown<br>
    and no longer appears to be pregnant. She looks<br>
    distraught -- she's been crying. Ogawa's N.D. HUSBAND<br>
    is standing by her, holding her hand, trying to comfort<br>
    her. Geordi is in the b.g., lying on another bio-bed.</p>

  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc.<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    I'll be right back, Alissa.</p>
  <p> Ogawa nods as Beverly takes Picard aside and speaks to<br>
    him quietly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    Alissa lost the baby.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think it's the same thing that<br>
    happened to Geordi. Somehow, the<br>
    temporal energy from the anomaly<br>
    caused the fetal tissue to revert<br>
    to an earlier stage of<br>
    development. It was as if the<br>
    unborn child began to... grow<br>
    younger... until finally the DNA<br>
    itself began to break down.</p>
  <p> Picard looks over at Ogawa.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is she?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Physically, she's fine. For now.<br>
    But if this temporal reversion<br>
    continues, I don't think any of us<br>
    are going to be fine for much<br>
    longer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So this is affecting the entire<br>
    crew...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Our cellular structures appear to<br>
    be coalescing... reverting to<br>

    In some cases, this has caused old<br>

    Eventually, this could kill us<br>
    all.</p>

  <p> Picard, Data, Riker, and Troi at the table. This is<br>

    Mister Data, how long until we've<br>
    completed the tachyon scan?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Approximately one hour, forty-five<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Once it's completed, I want<br>
    you to find a way to dissipate the<br>
    anomaly without making things<br>
    worse. Give me a risk analysis on<br>
    whatever solution you come up<br>
    with.</p>

    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Everyone except Picard EXITS. Picard moves to the<br>
    table and picks up a PADD from the many scattered on<br>
    the table. He walks to the window, taking a few steps<br>
    as he reads the PADD. From offcamera, we hear Q's<br>
    voice --</p>
  <p> Q'S VOICE<br>
    That's a pretty big decision, Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to see that Q is standing in the room. He<br>
    is dressed in his Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Tinkering with an anomaly you know<br>
    nothing about... trying to<br>
    collapse it... isn't that risky?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Will that cause the<br>
    destruction of mankind?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (pondering)<br>
    Maybe...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    On the other hand, maybe leaving<br>
    it alone would be the wrong thing<br>
    to do...</p>
  <p> He approaches Picard, intense, intimidating.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It's a big decision, all right...<br>
    Perhaps it would help to get a<br>
    different perspective...</p>
  <p> Abruptly, the scene CHANGES to:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/17/94 - ACT EIGHT 97.</p>
  <p>94 EXT. PRIMORDIAL EARTH - DISTANT PAST (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Q are standing on a craggy ledge overlooking<br>
    a vast expanse of LAVA, VOLCANIC GASES and CHURNING<br>
    SEAS. Picard reacts, looks around for a moment.<br>
    (NOTE: Picard still in present-day uniform; Q in his<br>
    Starfleet uniform).</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Welcome home.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Home?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Don't you recognize your old<br>

  <p> Picard looks up --</p>
  <p>95 NEW ANGLE - THE SKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Instead of a starfield, the sky is FILLED with the<br>
    SPATIAL ANOMALY seen throughout the show. But here it<br>
    is HUGE -- filling the entire sky from horizon to<br>
    horizon.</p>
  <p>96 RESUME</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The anomaly is here, at Earth... ?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    At this point in history, the<br>
    anomaly has filled this entire<br>
    quadrant of your galaxy.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this, thinking aloud.</p>

  <p> Q<br>
    (suddenly sees<br>
    something)<br>
    oh, oh -- come here, there's<br>
    something I want to show you!</p>
  <p> Q kneels down and Picard comes over to see what he's<br>
    looking at. Q is peering down into a small muddy POND.<br>
    The water is murky, but there should be no suggestion<br>
    of algae, fungus, or anything living.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (re: pond)<br>
    See this? This is you.</p>
  <p> Picard looks annoyed, thinks Q is toying with him.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm serious. Right here, life is<br>
    about to form on this planet for<br>
    the very first time. A group of<br>
    amino acids is about to combine<br>
    and form the first protein.<br>

    can't help but peer closer into the pond.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Strange, isn't it, Jean-Luc?<br>
    Everything you know... your entire<br>

    right here in this little pond of<br>
    goo. It's appropriate somehow,<br>

    Ohhhh! Nothing happened!<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    You see what you've done?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment, then looks up at the sky.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You mean I caused the anomaly...<br>
    and the anomaly... in some way...<br>
    disrupted the beginning of life on<br>

    Let's concentrate on how this<br>

    Speculation?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Temporal ruptures in the spacetime<br>
    continuum are rarely a naturally<br>
    occurring phenomenon. It is<br>
    therefore most likely that this<br>
    anomaly was caused by an outside<br>
    catalyst.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Like a warp core explosion...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I can rule out a warp core<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our tachyon pulse has been unable<br>
    to penetrate the anomaly<br>
    completely. If we had information<br>
    about the center of the<br>
    phenomenon, we might have a basis<br>
    for speculation.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    In theory, a tomographic imaging<br>

    offcamera.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh, my god.</p>
  <p> She stands and we MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard has just<br>
    ENTERED the room in his nightclothes. He moves<br>
    directly to Riker's table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wil! I know what's happening...<br>
    I know what causes the anomaly...<br>
    we have to go back!</p>
  <p> Riker reacts in surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Jean-Luc... the only place you're<br>
    going back to is bed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT NINE 110.</p>
  <p>107 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damnit Wil, I know what's<br>
    happening. We're causing the<br>
    anomaly... with a... with the<br>
    tachyon pulse... it happened in<br>
    all three time periods. We do it<br>
    in all three time periods!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc, you better come with me.</p>
  <p> Beverly tries to take his arm, but Picard jerks away<br>
    from her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Leave me alone! I'm not crazy.<br>
    The tachyon pulses... they -- they<br>
    were used in the same spot -- in<br>
    all three time periods... don't<br>
    you see? When the tachyon pulse<br>
    used the -- I mean, when the<br>
    Pasteur used the tachyon pulse, we<br>
    set the -- you know -- we...<br>
    started everything... we set it<br>
    in motion.</p>
  <p> Words fail Picard... his mental faculties preventing<br>
    him from giving them a clear picture.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's like... the chicken and the<br>
    egg! You think it started back<br>
    then... but it didn't... it<br>
    started here in the future...<br>
    that's why it gets larger in the<br>
    past...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I think I understand what the<br>
    Captain is saying. If I'm not<br>
    mistaken, he is describing a<br>
    paradox.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes! Yes, exactly!</p>
  <p> Data takes a beat, thinking of the possibilities.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Intriguing... it is possible we<br>
    could've created the very anomaly<br>
    we have been looking for.</p>
  <p> Data begins to pace... he's the very image of a<br>
    professor at work.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - 03/10/94 - ACT NINE 111.</p>
  <p>107 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Let us assume for the moment, that<br>
    the Captain has indeed been<br>
    travelling through time. Let us<br>
    also assume he has initiated an<br>
    inverse tachyon pulse at the same<br>
    coordinates in space in all three<br>
    time periods.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In that case, it is possible that<br>
    the convergence of three tachyon<br>
    pulses could've ruptured the<br>
    subspace barrier and caused an<br>
    anti-time reaction.</p>
  <p> Geordi is beginning to catch on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I see where you're going. And<br>
    because anti-time operates in the<br>
    opposite way normal time does, the<br>
    effects would run backwards<br>
    through the spacetime continuum.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes! That's why the anomaly was<br>
    larger in the past. It was<br>
    growing as it travelled backward<br>
    through time.</p>
  <p> A beat as they absorb this.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... let's say for the<br>
    moment, you're right. What do we<br>
    do about it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go back. Go back to the Devron<br>
    System.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He may be right. If we return to<br>
    the Devron System now, we might<br>
    see the initial formation of the<br>
    anomaly.</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at Riker... waiting to see what he'll<br>
    do. After a long beat, Riker hits his combadge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Bridge. Set course for<br>
    the Devron System. Maximum warp.</p>
  <p> GAINES' COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker stands. Everyone except Worf heads for the<br>
    doors. Riker stops and looks back.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf... we could use a hand.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a beat... considers... then decides to help<br>
    out, but it's not clear if there has been a<br>
    reconciliation. They EXIT.</p>

    The anomaly is being sustained by<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to all)<br>
    I've shut off the tachyon pulses<br>
    in the other time periods -- but<br>
    the anomaly didn't change.</p>
  <p> This draws a few curious looks from the others -- but<br>
    everyone now accepts that Picard is indeed travelling<br>
    through time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    It remains unaffected here as<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What do we do?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The only way to stop this thing is<br>
    to repair the rupture at the focal<br>
    point where time and anti-time are<br>
    converging.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do we do that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would require taking the ship<br>
    into the anomaly itself. Once<br>
    inside, we may be able to use our<br>
    engines to create a static warp<br>
    shell.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    Yeah, yeah... and the shell would<br>
    act like an artificial subspace<br>
    barrier -- separating time and<br>
    anti-time...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Collapsing the anomaly and<br>
    restoring the normal flow of time.<br>
    (turns to Picard)<br>

  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir... can you give us some<br>
    explanation?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I cannot.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, so far we've obeyed every<br>
    order -- no matter how far-fetched<br>
    it might have seemed. But if<br>
    we're to risk the safety of the<br>
    ship and crew... I think we have<br>
    to ask you for an explanation.</p>

    destroyed.</p>
  <p> At this moment, Q APPEARS standing next to Picard.<br>
    He's wearing a GRIM REAPER's outfit, complete with<br>
    scythe and hourglass.</p>

    Two down... one to go.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, report!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The anomaly is nearly collapsed...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're losing containment...</p>
  <p> The ship ROCKING, ROLLING!</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (calm)<br>
    Goodbye, Jean-Luc. I'll miss you.<br>
    You did have so much potential.<br>
    But I guess... all good things<br>
    must come to an end.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Containment field at critical!<br>
    I'm losing it --</p>
  <p>134 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - FUTURE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The anomaly COLLAPSES INWARD on top of the Enterprise --<br>
    the SCREEN WHITES OUT --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>135 INT. COURTROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Silence. Picard standing alone in a now empty<br>
    courtroom. He's dressed normally, present-day age.<br>
    Picard is a little disoriented by the sudden silence.<br>
    After a moment, Q's floating chair drops down into<br>
    frame. Q is dressed in his Judge's robes again. He<br>
    studies Picard.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The Continuum didn't think you had<br>
    it in you, Jean-Luc... but I knew<br>
    you could.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/28/94 - ACT TEN 125.</p>
  <p>135 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying it worked? We<br>
    collapsed the anomaly?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Is that all this meant to you?<br>
    Just another spatial anomaly...<br>
    just another day at the office?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q, did it work?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You're here, aren't you? You're<br>
    talking to me, aren't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about my crew?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    &quot;The anomaly... my crew... my<br>
    ship.&quot; I suppose you're worried<br>
    about your fish too. Well, if it<br>
    puts your mind at ease, you've<br>
    saved humanity once again.</p>
  <p> Picard regards Q briefly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    For what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You had a hand in helping me get<br>
    out of this.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I was the one who got you into it,<br>
    Jean-Luc. That was the directive<br>
    from the Continuum.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The part about the helping hand...<br>
    was my idea.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/28/94 - ACT TEN 126.</p>
  <p>135 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard looks around the courtroom.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I sincerely hope this is the last<br>
    time I'll find myself here.</p>
  <p> Q shakes his head.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You just don't get it, do you,<br>
    Jean-Luc?<br>
    (leans in to him)<br>
    The trial never ends.</p>
  <p> He smiles patronizingly.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We wanted to see if you had the<br>
    ability to expand your mind and<br>
    your horizons... and for one brief<br>
    moment, you did.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When I realized the paradox...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Exactly. For that one fraction of<br>
    a second, you were open to options<br>
    you'd never considered. That's<br>
    the exploration that awaits you...<br>
    not mapping stars and studying<br>
    nebulae... but charting the<br>
    unknowable possibilities of<br>
    existence.</p>

  <p>135 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> The Chair begins to MOVE AWAY from Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are you trying to tell me, Q?</p>
  <p> Q touches his hat in a half-salute. His chair is<br>
    almost fully withdrawn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/22/94 - ACT TEN 127.</p>
  <p>135 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You'll find out.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In any case, I'll be watching...<br>
    and if you're lucky, I'll drop by<br>
    to say hello from time to time.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    See you out there.</p>
  <p> And he's gone. The SCENE CHANGES TO:</p>
  <p>136 INT. CORRIDOR - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Picard stepping out of the Turbolift, dressed in his<br>
    bathrobe. Troi and Worf are standing there, looking at<br>
    him in surprise. We are back at the exact same moment<br>
    we saw in the Teaser. Picard stares at them, then<br>
    looks down at himself, sees his bathrobe...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, are you all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 3/11/94 - ACT TEN 128.</p>
  <p>136 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf... what's the date?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Stardate 47988.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles... overwhelmed with relief... he laughs.<br>
    Troi and Worf exchange a puzzled look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is something wrong, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no... in fact, I think I'll go<br>
    back to bed. I could use some<br>
    sleep.</p>
  <p> Picard steps back in the Lift. Troi and Worf exchange<br>
    a look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>137 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental.<br>
    Starfleet Command reports no<br>
    unusual activity along the Neutral<br>
    Zone, and there is no sign of a<br>
    temporal anomaly. It would appear<br>
    that I am the only member of the<br>
    crew to retain any knowledge of<br>
    the events I experienced.</p>
  <p>138 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS - PRESENT</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Beverly, Troi and Geordi sitting at the<br>
    table, playing POKER. Troi is raking in her winnings<br>
    with a big smile. Beverly pushes back her chair and<br>
    gets up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's it for me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's always next time.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles moves to an empty chair off to one side<br>
    of the table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/17/94 - ACT TEN 129.</p>
  <p>138 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's four hands in a row. How<br>
    does he do it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I cheat.</p>
  <p> Data's head snaps up in shock.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm kidding.</p>
  <p> Data collects the cards and begins shuffling at normal<br>
    speed. Beverly looks thoughtful.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've been thinking... about all<br>
    the things the Captain told us<br>
    about the future. The way we<br>
    changed and drifted apart... why<br>
    would he tell us what's to come?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It sure goes against everything<br>
    we've heard about not polluting<br>
    the time line...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe, however, that this<br>
    situation is unique.</p>
  <p> They all look at him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Since the temporal anomaly did not<br>
    occur, there have already been<br>
    changes in the way this time line<br>
    is unfolding. The future we<br>
    experience will undoubtedly be<br>
    different from the one the Captain<br>
    encountered.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe that's why he told us.<br>
    Knowing what that future could<br>
    bring... gives us a chance to<br>
    change things now.</p>
  <p> He gives Worf a meaningful look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    So that some things never happen.</p>
  <p> Worf nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/31/94 - ACT TEN 129A.

  <p>138 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Am I too late?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not at all. Have a seat.</p>
  <p> Troi sits, and Riker begins giving her chips.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's the game?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Five card draw, deuces wild.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The doors open and Picard ENTERS. Everyone reacts in<br>
    surprise, sits up at attention.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot; - REV. 3/11/94 - ACT TEN 130-130A 
  </p>
  <p>138 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain. Is there a problem?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. I just thought I might...<br>
    join you this evening. If there's<br>
    room...</p>
  <p> Surprised but pleased looks go around the table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a seat at the table. Data gives him the<br>
    deck of cards.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Would you care to deal?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;All Good Things... &quot;- REV. 03/31/94 - ACT TEN 131.</p>
  <p>138 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh... thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard starts to shuffle the cards.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I should have done this a long<br>
    time ago. I was quite a card<br>
    player in my youth, you know.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You were always welcome.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. His experience has left him with a new<br>
    appreciation of his feelings for these people... his<br>
    crew... his family...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So. Five card stud, nothing wild.<br>
    The sky's the limit.</p>
  <p> As Picard continues dealing, we PULL BACK for one final<br>
    look at this family of characters...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>139 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - PRESENT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship moving off into the distance...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
