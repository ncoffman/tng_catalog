    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON a banner which is strung across one of the<br>
    walls. It reads &quot;Captain Picard Day&quot; in big bold<br>
    letters. PICARD, TROI, and RIKER are standing in front<br>
    of the table, which is covered by a variety of gradeschool<br>
    level ARTS and CRAFTS. They all have something<br>
    to do with Picard (paper-mache busts, crayon drawings,<br>
    hand-written essays, dolls, embroidery, etc.) Picard<br>
    regards the table with some embarrassment while Riker<br>
    looks on with amusement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know why they have to do<br>
    this every year. In fact, I<br>
    thought last year the teachers<br>
    agreed not to do this anymore.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain Picard Day is one of the<br>
    children's favorite school<br>
    activities. They look forward to<br>
    it all year.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why does it have to be me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're the Captain... children<br>
    look up to you... you're a role<br>
    model for them.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up a crude drawing of himself -- it's<br>
    wildly exaggerated, with huge muscles in a superhero<br>
    pose standing on a planet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Their perception of me is a<br>
    little... exaggerated.</p>
  <p> Riker picks up a small doll with a Starfleet uniform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (using doll and<br>
    imitating voice)<br>
    &quot;I don't know... I think this<br>
    bears a certain resemblance.<br>
    Wouldn't you agree, Number One?&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard is not amused.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Don't you have something else to<br>
    do?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'll be on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Troi indicates the table.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The finalists will be here in half<br>
    an hour. You have to pick first,<br>
    second and third place and four<br>
    honorable mentions.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at the table for a long moment... he's<br>
    not looking forward to this.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to Captain. Incoming<br>
    transmission from Admiral<br>
    Blackwell. It is coded priority<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Put it through.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Excuse me, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Troi EXITS and Picard moves to the wall monitor.<br>
    ADMIRAL BLACKWELL appears on the monitor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Admiral.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    Captain. What is your status?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're conducting an energy output<br>
    study of the Mekoria Quasar. All<br>
    systems normal, the ship is fully<br>
    operational.</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    Good. I'm postponing the quasar<br>
    study for the moment. The<br>
    Enterprise is to rendezvous with<br>
    the starship Crazy Horse in sector<br>
    one-six-zero-seven immediately.<br>
    You're authorized to exceed warp<br>
    speed limitations for the duration<br>
    of this assignment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand. What is our<br>
    assignment?</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    I'd prefer not to discuss it over<br>
    subspace channels. The Crazy<br>
    Horse will be carrying someone<br>
    from Starfleet Intelligence...<br>
    he'll brief you when he arrives.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Blackwell is about to end the transmission, then sees<br>
    something behind Picard. Blackwell's eyebrows raise<br>
    slightly in amusement.</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    &quot;Captain Picard Day?&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard glances around and sees the banner which is<br>
    right behind him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh... yes. It's for the<br>
    children... I'm a... role model.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    I'm sure you are. Starfleet out.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Bridge in<br>
    some embarrassment.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> The two ships hang in space.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker walking toward the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So who won the contest?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Paul Menegay -- seven years old.<br>
    He did an interesting clay<br>
    sculpture of my head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is that the lumpy one with the<br>
    orange skin?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Oh, you'll be interested to know<br>
    that I've arranged for a Commander<br>
    Riker day next month. I'm even<br>
    considering making an entry<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Great.</p>
  <p> They EXIT to...</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Chief works and after a beat, ADMIRAL PRESSMAN<br>
    MATERIALIZES. Pressman is a confident, energetic man<br>
    in his mid-fifties. He reacts with pleasure at the<br>
    sight of Riker, moves directly to him and clasps a<br>
    paternal hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Wil. Bet you never thought you'd<br>
    see me again.</p>
  <p> But instead of pleasure, Riker's reaction is one of<br>
    complete and total shock. Riker tries to recover.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's... good to see you, sir.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Sure it is. You look like you're<br>
    about to faint.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... it's just been so long<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> Riker trails off as he suddenly realizes that Picard<br>
    has not been introduced.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry. Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard, Admiral Erik Pressman.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles and recognizes the name.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pressman? Oh, of course. You<br>
    were Wil's first commanding<br>
    officer... on the Pegasus.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    That's right. As a matter of<br>
    fact, it's the Pegasus which has<br>
    brought me here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> Pressman turns to Riker and makes some kind of personal<br>
    connection with him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    The Pegasus is still out there,<br>
    Wil. The Romulans found her.</p>
  <p> OFF Riker's shocked expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 OMITTED</p>
  <p>6 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and GEORDI are seated at the table as<br>
    Pressman moves around the room.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    As some of you may know, the<br>
    starship Pegasus was lost in this<br>
    sector twelve years ago along with<br>
    most of its crew. I was the<br>
    captain and Commander Riker here<br>
    was my helmsman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I remember reading about it. The<br>
    ship was destroyed by a... warp<br>
    core breach as I recall.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right. The Captain and I,<br>
    along with seven others managed to<br>
    get to an escape pod before the<br>
    breach became critical.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    From space, we saw what appeared<br>
    to be a matter/anti-matter<br>
    explosion which vaporized the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No wreckage was ever found, so<br>
    Starfleet officially listed the<br>
    ship as destroyed.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    However, all that changed three<br>
    days ago. Starfleet Intelligence<br>
    has an operative in the Romulan<br>
    High Command. He sent us a<br>
    message that a Romulan warbird had<br>
    located a piece of debris in the<br>
    Devolin system which was<br>
    positively identified as being<br>
    from the Pegasus. The Warbird was<br>
    then ordered to locate the rest of<br>
    the ship, if possible, and retrieve<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why would the Romulans try to<br>
    salvage pieces of a twelve year-old<br>
    starship?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    The Pegasus was a prototype...<br>
    experimental engine... new weapon<br>
    systems... some of our designs<br>
    were even used in constructing the<br>
    Enterprise. There're a lot of<br>
    things on board the Romulans would<br>
    love to get their hands on.</p>
  <p> Riker glances uncomfortably at Pressman, but the<br>
    Admiral doesn't react to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are our orders?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    We have to find the ship before<br>
    the Romulans do... salvage it if<br>
    possible... destroy it if<br>
    necessary. You'll command the<br>
    Enterprise while I remain in<br>
    overall command of the mission.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll need metallurgical and<br>
    chromographic specs on the Pegasus<br>
    in order to set up the proper<br>
    search parameters.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I'll make the appropriate<br>
    information available to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Set course for the Devolin system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> They all stand and head for the doors.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship nears the Devolin system -- a solar system<br>
    that never coalesced into discrete planetary bodies.<br>
    It's a swirling disc of rock and other matter.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, DATA, Geordi, and WORF at their stations,<br>
    Pressman standing near aft science with Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are approaching the Devolin<br>
    system, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any sign of the Romulans?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Oh, they're out there... they're<br>
    just waiting to see what you're<br>
    going to do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's an awful lot of ionizing<br>
    radiation in this system, Captain.<br>
    That, combined with the sheer<br>
    amount of rock is going to slow<br>
    down our search.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How slow?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, I'd say at least--</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Sir. Romulan Warbird decloaking<br>
    directly ahead.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; WARBIRD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A WARBIRD DECLOAKS directly in front of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They're powering weapons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Red alert. Raise shields. Standby<br>
    phasers.</p>
  <p> Everyone tenses on the Bridge as the ship's condition<br>
    goes to RED. A long moment passes as they look at the<br>
    image of the Warbird on the Viewscreen... but nothing<br>
    happens. Finally, Worf sees something on his console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... they are hailing us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> COMMANDER SIROL, a Romulan man appears on the<br>
    Viewscreen. He gives them a warm and friendly smile.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    (pleasantly)<br>
    I am Commander Sirol of the<br>
    Romulan vessel Terix. To whom do<br>
    I have the honor of speaking?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the Federation starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    Captain Picard... I've heard so<br>
    much about you. It's a pleasure<br>
    to make your acquaintance.<br>
    (innocent)<br>
    I hope our sudden appearance<br>
    didn't startle you.</p>
  <p> Picard decides to return his cool and friendly<br>
    demeanor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. But an... unannounced<br>
    appearance like this could have<br>
    unfortunate consequences. It<br>
    would be a shame if your ship were<br>
    damaged during such a...<br>
    misunderstanding.</p>
  <p> Sirol's expression hardens just a bit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    I am touched by your concern for<br>
    my ship. But I doubt we were ever<br>
    in any danger.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    May I ask what you are doing in<br>
    this system?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I could ask you the same question.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    (smooth)<br>
    We are conducting a survey of<br>
    gaseous anomalies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How interesting. So are we.<br>
    Perhaps we could combine our<br>
    efforts and share our findings.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I doubt our objectives are...<br>
    compatible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are probably right.</p>
  <p> The two rivals look at each other with polite smiles<br>
    masking the real tension here.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    This has been a most pleasant<br>
    conversation... but we must<br>
    return to our research.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I won't keep you.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are moving off... resuming<br>
    their tachyon scans of the system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand down from Red Alert, but<br>
    continue to track their movements,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The Red Alert signal goes OFF.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Commander, how long will it take<br>
    to search the system?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At least seven days, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And the Romulans have a two day<br>
    head start.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a deep breath, this is going to be a long<br>
    process.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then we better get to it. Mister<br>
    Data?</p>

  <p> Riker and Pressman are sitting at one of the tables<br>
    near the windows with a couple of drinks in front of<br>
    them. There is a familiarity and warmth between the<br>
    two men... almost like father and son.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    How long have you had the beard?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    About four years. I think I just<br>

  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    What was it that Lieutenant Boylen<br>
    used to call you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grimaces)<br>
    Ensign Babyface.</p>
  <p> Pressman smiles at the memory.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    You never did have much sense of<br>
    humor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I like to think I've loosened up<br>
    in my old age.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been known to tell a joke or<br>
    two.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    It's about time. You were always<br>
    so serious on the Pegasus.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a little melancholy)<br>
    We went through some... serious<br>
    times.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing, quiet)<br>
    Do you really think we'll find the<br>
    Pegasus?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I wouldn't have come all the way<br>
    out here if I didn't.</p>
  <p> Riker glances around the room... they're in a public<br>
    place, but he can't help asking certain questions that<br>
    would be better served in private.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And what about our... experiment?<br>
    Do you think we'll find that too?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pressman doesn't answer right away... he's not<br>
    comfortable talking about this here either.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Maybe.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a beat and looks out the windows for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know... I still think about<br>
    what happened... about that last<br>
    day.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    So do I. It's not the kind of<br>
    thing you just forget about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you ever... wonder whether we<br>
    did the right thing?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Never. It was a tragedy, yes.<br>
    But it wasn't your fault and it<br>
    wasn't mine. What we were doing<br>
    was for the good of the<br>
    Federation. We can't blame<br>
    ourselves because the others<br>
    couldn't see that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know... but maybe we went about<br>
    it the wrong way.</p>
  <p> There's an uncomfortable beat as Riker looks away and<br>
    Pressman studies him.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Well, this time we may have a<br>
    chance to do it the right way. If<br>
    this mission is successful... if<br>
    we do find the Pegasus and our<br>
    &quot;experiment&quot;... we can finish<br>
    what we started twelve years ago.</p>

  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    You want to try again?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    It's not just me.<br>
    (glances around, then<br>
    sotto)<br>
    The Chief of Starfleet Security<br>
    has personally assured me of her<br>
    complete support.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral Raner... ? How many other<br>
    people know about this?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Not many. And it's up to us to<br>
    make sure it stays that way.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Raner gave me written orders for<br>
    you... you'll find them coded in<br>
    the Enterprise computer. You've<br>
    been instructed not to reveal the<br>
    true nature of our mission to<br>
    anyone, not even Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Riker is clearly uncomfortable with this, but Pressman<br>
    smiles and tries to reassure him.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Don't worry... it won't be like it<br>
    was twelve years ago. This time,<br>
    no one's going to stop us.</p>
  <p> Pressman smiles confidently at him. But Riker isn't<br>
    sure this is a good idea... off his troubled<br>
    expression...</p>

  <p>14 OMITTED</p>
  <p>15 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is pouring drinks for himself and Pressman. The<br>
    mood is relaxed and casual... two senior officers<br>
    taking an opportunity to kick back and talk. Midconversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... as a matter of fact, I never<br>
    met Wil before he reported aboard<br>
    at Farpoint Station.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You chose your first officer<br>
    without ever meeting him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was looking through the records<br>
    of about fifty candidates... Wil's<br>
    was much like all the others...<br>
    filled with the usual dry<br>
    statistics and glowing letters of<br>
    recommendation that tell you<br>
    nothing. I was about to put it<br>
    aside and go on to the next file,<br>
    when something caught my eye.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There had been an incident on<br>
    Altair Three when Wil was First<br>
    Officer of the Hood. He refused<br>
    to let Captain DeSoto beam down<br>
    during a crisis. He disobeyed a<br>
    direct order and risked a general<br>
    court martial because he thought<br>
    he was right. When I read that...<br>
    I knew I'd found my Number One.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    You wanted someone with a history<br>
    of disobedience?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wanted someone who would stand<br>
    up to me... someone who was more<br>
    concerned with the safety of the<br>
    ship and accomplishing the mission<br>
    than with how something looked on<br>
    his record. To me, that's one of<br>
    the marks of a good officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> For some reason, it's clear that this has pushed some<br>
    kind of button with Pressman. An edge creeps into his<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Frankly, I've always felt it was<br>
    more important for an officer to<br>
    trust his captain's judgment. In<br>
    a crisis, there's no time for<br>
    explanations... orders have to be<br>
    obeyed without question or lives<br>
    may be lost.</p>
  <p> Picard is a little surprised at Pressman's change in<br>
    tone, and his reply carries a hint of reproach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I am aware of that, Admiral.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (backing off)<br>
    Of course you are.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I guess this mission has brought<br>
    up some... old ghosts for me. You<br>
    know what it's like to lose a<br>
    ship... you're always wondering<br>
    if there was something else you<br>
    should have done... something you<br>
    missed.</p>
  <p> A silent moment as they both lapse into private<br>
    thought. Picard finally decides to probe for a little<br>
    more information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... the records regarding<br>
    the loss of the Pegasus are a<br>
    bit... vague about what happened<br>
    just before you abandoned ship.<br>
    Can you add anything to the...<br>
    official account?</p>
  <p> Pressman considers Picard for a moment, then gets up<br>
    and moves to the windows. Pressman would like nothing<br>
    more than to tell Picard exactly what happened -- he's<br>
    quite proud of it actually -- but he can't.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I'm afraid not.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I can tell you this: Twelve<br>
    years ago, I needed an officer I<br>
    could count on in a crisis...<br>
    someone who would support and obey<br>
    my decisions without question...<br>
    someone willing to trust my<br>
    judgment... that someone was Wil<br>
    Riker... and without his loyalty,<br>
    none of us would have survived.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's thoughtful expression as he considers<br>
    Pressman's words...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>16 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, wearing a karate gi. He's holding his<br>
    side in pain. BEVERLY moves to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I busted a rib.</p>
  <p> A Nurse guides him to the table as Beverly grabs her<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What were you doing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was practicing Bat'leth moves<br>
    with Worf. I jabbed when I<br>
    should've blocked. He caught me<br>
    right in the side. I'm glad we<br>
    were using sticks instead of real<br>
    blades.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    It's broken all right.<br>
    (to Nurse)<br>
    Give him ten cc's of terakine for<br>
    the pain.</p>
  <p> The Nurse gets a hypospray and injects him with it.<br>
    Beverly grabs a large medical DEVICE and fits it to his<br>
    side. She works the device during the following.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker is very frustrated, much more upset about this<br>
    incident than he should be.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't believe how stupid I was.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You both got a little carried<br>
    away, that's all...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. It was my fault. I lost<br>
    focus... I let myself get<br>
    distracted at a crucial moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It happens to everyone.</p>
  <p> But Riker isn't really listening to her... he's wrapped<br>
    up in some personal angst... his words carry some<br>
    private subtext only he is aware of.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I knew what I was supposed to<br>
    do... but I didn't do it. If<br>
    we'd had real Bat'leths I might be<br>
    dead right now.</p>
  <p> She finishes using the device on his side.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wil... it's all right. You made<br>
    a mistake... no harm done. You'll<br>
    do better next time.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (downbeat)<br>
    Yeah... maybe.</p>
  <p> Riker gets up and EXITS. Beverly looks after him with<br>
    a puzzled look.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> Geordi suddenly reacts to something on his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (excited)<br>
    Whoa... I think we might have just<br>
    struck paydirt.</p>
  <p> Riker moves to the aft station, where Geordi is looking<br>
    at a graphic display of a large ASTEROID.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's a subspace resonance<br>
    signature coming from this<br>
    asteroid.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And from the frequency variances,<br>
    it looks like the pattern from a<br>
    Federation warp core.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain Picard to the Bridge,<br>
    please.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to the Con Officer as Picard and Pressman<br>
    ENTER from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing, to Con)<br>
    Bring us to within ten kilometers<br>
    of asteroid gamma six zero one.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Geordi's found something.</p>
  <p> Picard and Pressman move to where Geordi is continuing<br>
    to work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    There's a subspace resonance<br>
    signature coming from that<br>
    asteroid, sir. It could be the<br>
    warp core of the Pegasus.</p>
  <p> Pressman looks over the readings.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I think he's right... I recognize<br>
    some of the variance patterns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put the asteroid on the main<br>
    viewer.</p>
  <p> Geordi works and now the ASTEROID can be seen on the<br>
    main Viewscreen. This asteroid is pitted with craters,<br>
    fissures, and canyons all over its surface... a barren,<br>
    ugly hunk of rock.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have confirmed Geordi's<br>
    readings, sir. The resonance<br>
    signature is originating from<br>
    somewhere beneath the asteroid's<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Beneath the surface? How's that<br>
    possible?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This asteroid contains several<br>
    deep chasms large enough for a<br>
    starship to enter. It is possible<br>
    the Pegasus drifted into the<br>
    asteroid's gravitational field and<br>
    was pulled down into one of the<br>
    fissures.</p>

  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, the Romulan warbird has<br>
    altered course again... they are<br>
    heading toward our position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They probably want to see what<br>
    we're so interested in over here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, how long will it take<br>
    to determine the exact location of<br>
    the Pegasus?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At least another six hours,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    That's too long. If the Romulans<br>
    start searching the asteroid, they<br>
    could find the ship before we do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I recommend we destroy the<br>
    asteroid. It would take almost<br>
    all our photon torpedoes, but it<br>
    would preclude any possibility of<br>
    the Pegasus falling into Romulan<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> Pressman gives him a sharp look... we're not sure why,<br>
    but he definitely doesn't like that advice coming from<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (with an edge)<br>
    Our top priority is to salvage the<br>
    ship, Commander. I'll consider<br>
    destroying it only as a last<br>
    resort.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Can you give me a third<br>
    alternative?</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment... then gets an idea.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, is it possible to<br>
    saturate the asteroid with<br>
    verteron particles? That could<br>
    mask the resonance signature from<br>
    the Romulans... prevent them from<br>
    detecting it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    In order for the deception to<br>
    succeed, it would have to appear<br>
    to be a natural phenomenon.<br>
    Verteron particles are artificial<br>
    in nature.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wait a minute... we could blanket<br>
    the asteroid with high levels of<br>
    ionizing radiation. There's so<br>
    much of it in this system already,<br>
    the Romulans won't know the<br>
    difference.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Theoretically, it should work..</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (off console)<br>
    If we're going to do it, we have<br>
    to do it fast... the Romulans will<br>
    be in sensor range in about a<br>
    minute.</p>
  <p> Picard and Pressman exchange a look. Pressman nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Aye, sir. Initiating an<br>

    After he's finished, we'll have to<br>

    scanned the asteroid, but didn't<br>
    find anything.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    Lay in a course to the next search<br>

    Commander, I want to see you in<br>
    the Captain's Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Data, you have the Bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pressman and Riker EXIT to the Ready Room.</p>
  <p>21 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Pressman and Riker ENTER from the Bridge. As soon as<br>
    the doors CLOSE behind them, Pressman turns on Riker<br>
    with anger.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    What the hell's the matter with<br>
    you? Destroy the Pegasus? Before<br>
    we've even taken a look at it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought it was more important to<br>
    keep the Romulans from--</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    Well, you were wrong. We have a<br>
    chance here to change the balance<br>
    of power in this quadrant. But we<br>
    can't do that if we destroy the<br>
    Pegasus, now can we?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (tight)<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Pressman takes a couple of steps around the room and<br>
    lets his anger pass... he considers Riker with a little<br>
    more sympathy... like a father who's just finished<br>
    chewing out his son.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    It hasn't been easy I'm sure...<br>
    keeping your Captain and friends<br>
    in the dark like this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I haven't enjoyed it if that's<br>
    what you mean.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I hope you understand that it's<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand that you think it's<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (studies him, then more<br>
    personal)<br>
    You have changed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Changed... ?</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (shrugs it off)<br>
    Just something the Captain and I<br>
    were talking about...</p>
  <p> Pressman looks at Riker... thinks for a moment...<br>
    decides on a different tack.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    To be honest... I'm glad to see<br>
    this kind of change in you, Wil.<br>
    Strong... forceful... unafraid to<br>
    state your opinions and stand by<br>
    them... a far cry from the young<br>
    man who used to sit at my helm and<br>
    worry about pressing the wrong<br>
    button.</p>
  <p> This mention of the past softens Riker a little... he<br>
    looks vaguely embarrassed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A lot of things can change in<br>
    twelve years, Admiral.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Yes, they can.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But it's important that a man<br>
    changes the right things in his<br>
    life... not his sense of duty...<br>
    his sense of loyalty...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd like to think that I...<br>
    haven't changed those things, sir.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I'd like to think so too. Because<br>
    those things say more about a man<br>
    than the rank on his collar or the<br>
    uniform he wears... they define<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pressman moves to him... puts a fatherly hand on his<br>
    shoulder... makes this a very personal moment.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Twelve years ago, a lot of older<br>
    and more seasoned officers turned<br>
    away from their duty, but you<br>
    stood up for what was right. I<br>
    know what kind of man you are,<br>
    Wil... and I know I can count on<br>
    you again.</p>
  <p> Pressman smiles at him with confidence, and then EXITS.<br>
    Riker is left alone and looking very troubled.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>22 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard is intently studying a PADD on the table. The<br>
    remains of a Japanese dinner are sitting on the table.<br>
    The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: PADD)<br>
    The scan analysis you asked for.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the PADD and sets it down without even<br>
    looking at it. He's polite, but there is a certain<br>
    chilliness in his attitude toward Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you. Can I interest you in<br>
    some sashimi?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, thanks.</p>
  <p> An awkward beat as Picard simply looks at Riker as if<br>
    waiting for him to say something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there anything else, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, there is.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard looks at him for a moment... then picks up the<br>
    PADD he was originally studying... takes a deep<br>
    breath...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, reading)<br>
    &quot;Judge Advocate General's Report.<br>
    Stardate xxxxx. Subject: Inquiry<br>
    into Mutiny Aboard USS Pegasus.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard looks up at Riker, who stiffens at the words but<br>
    says nothing. Picard presses a control on the PADD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, reading)<br>
    &quot;Based on testimony from Captain<br>
    Pressman and other surviving<br>
    officers, the Judge Advocate<br>
    believes there is sufficient<br>
    evidence to conclude that certain<br>
    members of the crew did mutiny<br>
    against the captain just prior to<br>
    the destruction of the Pegasus.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard fastens a laser-like gaze on Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mutiny... on a Federation<br>
    starship. It's shocking -- no,<br>
    it's unthinkable. And yet you've<br>
    never mentioned it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It wasn't easy getting this<br>
    record. I had to call in a few<br>
    favors at Starfleet just to get a<br>
    look at it. It seems the file was<br>
    sealed by Starfleet Intelligence.</p>
  <p> Picard sets the PADD down and moves about the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    So... not only was the Pegasus<br>
    carrying &quot;sensitive&quot; equipment<br>
    that can't be allowed to fall into<br>
    Romulan hands...<br>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    ... not only was there a mysterious<br>
    explosion which appeared to<br>
    destroy the ship, but didn't...<br>
    but now it turns out there was a<br>
    mutiny on board.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've read the official report of<br>
    the mutiny. But I'd like to hear<br>
    your version of what happened.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks about this for a long moment, then drags<br>
    up something from his past that he's tried to put<br>
    behind him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was on the Bridge. The ship was<br>
    at yellow alert... we were running<br>
    some... tests on the engines.<br>
    Something went wrong... there was<br>
    an explosion in Engineering...<br>
    heavy casualties. In the middle<br>
    of the crisis, the First Officer,<br>
    the Chief Engineer, almost the<br>
    entire Bridge crew mutinied<br>
    against Captain Pressman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They... felt the Captain was<br>
    jeopardizing the ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was seven months out of the<br>
    Academy... my head was still<br>
    ringing with words like duty and<br>
    honor.<br>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When they moved against him, I<br>
    thought they were a group of self-serving,<br>
    disloyal officers.<br>
    (beat, then quieter)<br>
    So I grabbed a phaser and defended<br>
    my captain. Two or three others<br>
    joined in on our side, but it was<br>
    clear the mutineers had most of<br>
    the crew behind them... we felt we<br>
    had to get off the ship. There<br>
    was a... running firefight all<br>
    the way to the escape pod.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    About five minutes after we left<br>
    the ship... there was an<br>
    explosion...</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a moment. Then he begins to<br>
    move about the room, reading other portions of material<br>
    on his PADD.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reading)<br>
    &quot;The Judge Advocate also believes<br>
    that the surviving officers are<br>
    deliberately withholding vital<br>
    information from this inquiry.<br>
    Further investigation is<br>
    recommended.&quot;<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    But there was no further<br>
    investigation... the file was<br>
    classified and quietly buried.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir... maybe you should take this<br>
    up with the Admiral.</p>
  <p> Picard's temper is starting to build, but he is trying<br>
    to give Riker the benefit of the doubt here... looking<br>
    for something from Riker to validate Picard's trust in<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm taking it up with you. The<br>
    Judge Advocate thought you were<br>
    participating in a conspiracy to<br>
    cover-up the truth. That you were<br>
    lying about what really happened<br>
    on the Pegasus. Now, I want you<br>
    to tell me that's not true.</p>
  <p> Riker says nothing. Picard looks at him in<br>
    frustration... finally he throws the PADD down on the<br>
    table in anger. He confronts Riker directly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing, harsh)<br>
    Wil, what the hell's going on<br>
    here? Why did your crew mutiny?<br>
    And why is Pressman so determined<br>
    to find your ship twelve years<br>
    later?</p>
  <p> This is a very difficult moment for Riker, but he<br>
    steels himself and tries to meet Picard's steady gaze.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (formal)<br>
    I've told you all I can. I am<br>
    under the direct orders of Admiral<br>
    Pressman... not to discuss this.<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; 10/18/93 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a moment... nods... seems to<br>
    think it over and sits down. His tone becomes quieter,<br>
    more philosophical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. He's an admiral, I'm<br>
    a captain -- I can't force you to<br>
    disobey him.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will tell you this... I need to<br>
    place a great deal of trust in the<br>
    person who serves as my first<br>
    officer. You've had that trust...<br>
    until now. But something is wrong<br>
    here... and you're part of it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And when this mission is over...<br>
    I may have to re-evaluate the<br>
    command structure of this ship.</p>

  <p> Picard is talking to Admiral Blackwell on the terminal<br>
    screen. Mid-conversation.</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    Captain, Starfleet places the<br>
    highest priority on the success of<br>
    this mission. Your request for a<br>
    delay is denied.</p>
  <p> Picard's tone goes personal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Margaret... something's very wrong<br>
    here. Do you know what's going<br>
    on?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT THREE 37A.</p>
  <p>23A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Blackwell seems to think this over for a moment...<br>
    leans forward a little, but doesn't let her guard down<br>
    completely.</p>
  <p> BLACKWELL<br>
    I know that the Chief of Starfleet<br>
    Intelligence herself is watching<br>
    this one, Jean-Luc. So you would<br>
    be well-advised to follow<br>
    Pressman's orders and leave it at<br>
    that. Starfleet out.</p>
  <p> The Transmission ENDS. Picard is dissatisfied with<br>
    that answer, but has little recourse at the moment.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, where are the<br>
    Romulans?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are out of sensor range on<br>

    Bring us to within fifteen<br>
    kilometers and hold position.</p>
  <p> On the monitor at Data's station, there is an Okudagram<br>
    schematic of the asteroid. Data points to a bright<br>
    POINT of light which is deep inside the asteroid.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For the past several hours, I have<br>
    been scanning the area where we<br>
    detected the resonance signature<br>
    of the Pegasus. From the strength<br>
    and polarity of the signature, it<br>
    would appear that most of the warp<br>
    core is still intact.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    If we're lucky, the entire<br>
    engineering section could be down<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So how do we get to it? I<br>
    wouldn't want to try to transport<br>
    through that much solid rock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. What about a shuttle? We<br>
    could send it down through one of<br>
    these fissures.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would recommend against that,<br>
    sir. There may be gravimetric or<br>
    magnetic fluctuations inside the<br>
    asteroid which would overpower the<br>
    engines on a shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Sounds like the best solution is<br>
    to take the Enterprise in.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker look at him in surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You mean into the asteroid?</p>

  <p>25 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The viewer now shows a LARGE CHASM on the surface of<br>
    the asteroid.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    This chasm is large enough for us<br>
    to maneuver in. Besides, if<br>
    there's any hope of salvaging the<br>
    Pegasus, we'll need a starship to<br>
    do it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is theoretically possible,<br>
    Captain. But I am unaware of any<br>
    prior situation where a starship<br>
    was taken so deeply inside a<br>
    planetary body. There may be<br>
    unforeseen difficulties.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Pressman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... I don't think we can<br>
    risk--</p>
  <p> Pressman cuts him off without raising his voice.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (smooth)<br>
    I've made my decision. Prepare to<br>
    take the Enterprise in, Captain.<br>

    There are small turns and adjustments that the ship<br>

    Admiral, if the passage narrows to<br>

    You can charge me with<br>
    insubordination if you wish, but<br>

    Let's keep the speculation to a<br>
    minimum. We have to begin the<br>
    salvage operation. The equipment<br>
    we need was in main engineering.<br>
    Can you scan that section of the<br>
    Pegasus?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    The starboard bulkhead of Main<br>
    Engineering is contained within<br>
    the rock face... but most of the<br>
    compartment is still intact.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    There is a hull breach in that<br>
    section.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    If we begin a power transfer, can<br>
    you restore life support to that<br>
    compartment?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so. The breach can be<br>
    temporarily sealed by extending<br>
    our shields.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    See to it. Once you've restored<br>
    life support, Commander Riker and<br>
    I will beam directly into<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I'd like to send a<br>
    complete Away Team to --</p>

  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    There's some very sensitive<br>
    equipment over there. I don't<br>
    want anyone else near it.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly getting tired of being overruled by<br>
    this guy, but he has little choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a last look with Picard, and then Riker<br>
    and Pressman EXIT to the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>28 EXT. SPACE - THE PEGASUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is still fused into the rock.</p>
  <p>29 INT. PEGASUS ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The engine room of the ship looks just as strange as<br>
    the exterior. The room contains the usual assortment<br>
    of equipment and consoles, but one entire wall is<br>
    composed of SOLID ROCK. The floor and other bulkhead<br>
    meld seamlessly into the rock face as if they were<br>
    designed that way.</p>
  <p> None of the equipment is working and the room is very<br>
    DARK. But there are several DEAD N.D. BODIES in old-style<br>
    Starfleet uniforms lying in different positions<br>
    on the deck and over the consoles.</p>
  <p> Riker and Pressman MATERIALIZE. They are both carrying<br>
    palm beacons and are wearing tricorders. Pressman is<br>
    carrying a tool kit. They react to the room and the<br>
    sight of the dead bodies around them for a moment<br>
    before either of them speaks.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    This room was open to space for<br>
    twelve years...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The vacuum preserved everything...</p>
  <p> Riker shines his light on one of the dead bodies...<br>
    reacts to the face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/18/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Pressman moves to a panel and touches it. The<br>
    emergency LIGHTS COME ON. They turn off their palm<br>
    beacons. Riker examines the rock face with the aid of<br>
    his tricorder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I wonder how many of the crew are<br>
    back there...</p>
  <p> Pressman decides to get back to business.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    We're not here for a memorial<br>
    service.</p>
  <p> Pressman moves to a wall console.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It should be in here.</p>
  <p> Pressman reaches out and unfastens a couple of<br>
    clamps... then removes the large Mees panel from the<br>
    wall, revealing a large exotic-looking DEVICE -- large<br>
    roughly cylindrical piece of equipment which is hooked<br>
    up to various conduits against one bulkhead. Pressman<br>
    reacts with relief -- this is what they've come here<br>
    for.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's still intact.</p>
  <p> Pressman looks to Riker to share his excitement, but<br>
    Riker's reaction is very different -- seeing the device<br>
    seems to have brought his worst fears to fruition.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's wrong? Don't you<br>
    understand? We found it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/18/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pressman begins to use some of the tools from the tool<br>
    kit to disconnect the various conduits from the wall.<br>
    But Riker makes no move to help Pressman, the sight of<br>
    the device has now put Riker squarely on the spot -- he<br>
    can't avoid taking action one way or the other, and so<br>
    he confronts Pressman.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    I know. I just kept hoping it<br>
    wasn't going to be here... that it<br>
    would've been destroyed or buried<br>
    back there in the rock...</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    What the hell's that supposed to<br>
    mean?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It means I can't put this off any<br>
    longer. Right up until this<br>
    moment, I had the... luxury of<br>
    time. Now I have to make a<br>
    choice.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And Admiral... I'm afraid the only<br>
    choice I can make... is to put a<br>
    stop to this. I can't let you<br>
    start these experiments all over<br>
    again. It was wrong twelve years<br>
    ago, and it's still wrong today.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    You'd better reconsider that<br>
    position, Commander. We have a<br>
    mission to accomplish and you're<br>
    going to carry it out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's all that matters to you,<br>
    isn't it -- starting your<br>
    experiment again. Look around...<br>
    we're standing in a room filled<br>
    with bodies... people who died<br>
    because of that thing.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Keep your self-righteous comments<br>
    to yourself. I knew most of these<br>
    people a lot longer than you<br>
    did... it was tragic. But it was<br>
    their own fault.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/18/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't know that. Neither of<br>
    us knows what happened after we<br>
    left.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    It's not hard to guess. They<br>
    tried to shut down an experiment<br>
    they didn't understand. Something<br>
    went wrong. And it killed them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No... we killed them.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    That doesn't sound like the young<br>
    Conn Officer who grabbed a phaser<br>
    and defended his captain twelve<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah, well I've had twelve years<br>
    to think about it. And if I had<br>
    to do it over again... I'd point<br>
    that phaser at you instead of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    So on reflection... you'd rather<br>
    be a traitor than a hero.</p>
  <p> Riker closes some of the distance between them... the<br>
    tension between the two men is definitely heating up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wasn't a hero and neither were<br>
    you. What you were doing was<br>
    wrong and I was wrong to support<br>
    you... I was just too young and<br>
    stupid to realize it at the time.<br>
    You were the captain, I was the<br>
    ensign... and I followed orders.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    And if you hadn't, you'd be dead<br>
    right now along with all the rest.<br>
    Dead because you listened to a<br>
    bunch of mutinous cowards who were<br>
    too blinded by fear to see what I<br>
    was trying to do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/18/93 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They were brave enough to risk<br>
    their lives to stop you from<br>
    violating a treaty the Federation<br>
    signed in good faith.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    That treaty has bound our hands<br>
    and given the Romulans a tactical<br>
    advantage for sixty years. I was<br>
    simply trying to level the playing<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And now you're going to try again.<br>
    How many people will die this<br>
    time? Fifty? A hundred? A<br>
    thousand?</p>
  <p> Pressman has finished disconnecting the device from the<br>
    bulkhead. Pressman and Riker look at each other for a<br>
    long moment.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    You don't want to help me... fine.<br>
    But you're still under my direct<br>
    orders not to talk about what you<br>
    know... and I expect you to follow<br>
    those orders to the letter.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I made you... and I can break you<br>
    just as easily.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the ship SHAKES. Both men are staggered for<br>
    a moment. The ship SHAKES again.</p>

    How can we help?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you responsible for this?</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    I'm not sure. We were conducting<br>
    some... geological experiments on<br>
    the surface of the asteroid. It's<br>
    possible that we... accidently<br>
    sealed you in.<br>

    If only we had known you were<br>
    beneath the surface... if you had<br>
    shared your plans with us, this<br>
    might have been avoided.</p>
  <p> Picard's not buying any of this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it you want, Sirol?</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    I don't want anything, Captain.<br>

    stay as our guests, you will be<br>
    returned to the Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you for your... generous<br>
    offer. I will... take it under<br>
    advisement.</p>
  <p> SIROL<br>
    As you wish. We'll be continuing<br>
    our... research in this system for<br>
    a while longer. I await your<br>
    decision.</p>

  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    We can't do it. If we abandon the<br>
    Enterprise they'll come back here<br>
    and get their hands on both ships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Options?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We could use the phasers to cut<br>
    our way out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The asteroid's internal structure<br>
    is highly unstable. Any attempt<br>
    to cut through the rock could<br>
    cause the entire chasm to<br>
    collapse.</p>
  <p> There is a long beat... then Riker makes a difficult<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... I have a suggestion.<br>
    There's a piece of equipment under<br>
    guard in Admiral Pressman's<br>
    quarters which could get us out of<br>
    here.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's a prototype for a Federation<br>
    cloaking device.</p>
  <p> Pressman's eyes flare in anger. He moves close to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (quiet, hard)<br>
    You just ended your career, Wil.</p>
  <p> Picard's reaction is one of shock and dismay. He turns<br>
    to Pressman with a cold expression.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what this is all about? A<br>
    cloaking device? In the Treaty of<br>
    Algeron the Federation<br>
    specifically agreed not to develop<br>
    cloaking technology.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    And that treaty is the biggest<br>
    mistake we ever made. It's kept<br>
    us from exploiting a vital area of<br>
    defense that--</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    That treaty has kept the peace for<br>
    sixty years. And as a Starfleet<br>
    officer, you are sworn to uphold<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Pressman steps back from Picard's anger, and tries to<br>
    retake control of the situation.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    That's enough. I'm taking command<br>
    of this vessel. Mister Worf,<br>
    escort the Captain to his<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at Worf, who then very slowly and<br>
    deliberately folds his arms and does nothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Pressman)<br>
    I don't think anyone's going to<br>
    come to your defense this time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    How can we use the cloak to escape<br>
    the asteroid?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's more than just a cloak. It<br>
    changes the structure of matter...<br>
    in theory, a ship using this<br>
    device would be able to pass<br>
    through normal matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Pressman)<br>
    That's why you were so eager to<br>
    find it...</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    Can't you see the potential here?<br>
    The phasing cloak could be the<br>
    greatest breakthrough in weapons<br>
    research in the last fifty years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Except it's illegal... it's a<br>
    violation of an agreement the<br>
    Federation signed in good faith.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... we might be able to<br>
    adapt the cloak for the Enterprise<br>
    engines and use it to escape the<br>
    asteroid.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't want to do this... he's not comfortable<br>
    with this notion, but there doesn't seem to be any<br>
    other way at the moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    console)<br>
    The Warbird is off the port bow.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're still waiting for us to<br>
    make up our minds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Disengage the cloaking device,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    What? You can't do that. If the<br>
    Romulans see us decloak, they'll<br>
    know that we have --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They'll know the truth, Admiral.<br>
    Which is what everyone is going to<br>
    know very shortly.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Carry out my orders.</p>
  <p> Riker works the console for a moment.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>45 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; ASTEROID (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The asteroid is sitting in space. The Warbird is<br>
    nearby. Suddenly the Enterprise DECLOAKS outside the<br>
    asteroid in normal space.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/18/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>46 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, send a message to the<br>
    Warbird... inform them that their<br>
    government will be contacted<br>
    shortly regarding this incident.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf works as Picard turns to Pressman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I hereby charge you with<br>
    violation of the Treaty of<br>
    Algeron. As Captain of the<br>
    Enterprise, I'm placing you under<br>
    arrest. Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf comes down from Tactical and indicates the<br>
    Turbolift to Pressman.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Admiral, if you will come with<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> PRESSMAN<br>
    I have a lot of friends at<br>
    Starfleet Command, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're going to need them.</p>
  <p> Worf begins to escort Pressman off the Bridge. Riker<br>
    suddenly stands up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant. I'll have to be<br>
    placed under arrest as well.</p>
  <p> Worf looks to Picard, who then grimly nods. Worf<br>
    escorts Pressman and Riker off the Bridge.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>47 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moving at impulse power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>48 INT. BRIG (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker is pacing back and forth behind the invisible<br>
    forcefield. Picard ENTERS the room and nods to the<br>
    N.D. Guard. The Guard EXITS and Picard moves to the<br>
    Brig entrance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've spoken to Fleet Admiral<br>
    Shanthi. There will be a full<br>
    inquiry once we reach Starbase two-four-seven...<br>
    and it will probably<br>
    lead to a general court martial of<br>
    Admiral Pressman and several<br>
    others at Starfleet Intelligence.</p>
  <p> Riker nods... he was expecting this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Your... involvement in this affair<br>
    will be thoroughly investigated,<br>
    Wil... there will be some hard<br>
    questions for you to answer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You made a mistake twelve years<br>
    ago... but your service since that<br>
    time has earned you a great deal<br>
    of respect... from me and from a<br>
    great many others. This incident<br>
    may cost you some of that<br>
    respect...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't help feeling that I should<br>
    have come forward a long time<br>
    ago...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When the moment came to make the<br>
    decision... you made the right<br>
    one...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Pegasus&quot; REV. 10/20/93 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    No matter what that choice may<br>
    have cost you... and no matter how<br>
    much Pressman may have meant to<br>
    you... you chose to tell the<br>
    truth and face the consequences.</p>
  <p> Picard DEACTIVATES the forcefield.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As long as you can do that...<br>
    you'll still deserve to wear that<br>
    uniform... and I'll still be<br>
    proud to have you as my first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> A close moment between the two men... then Picard leads<br>
    them both out of the Brig and they EXIT to the<br>
    Corridor.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
