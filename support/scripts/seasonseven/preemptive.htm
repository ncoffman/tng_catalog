    TEASER </p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47941.7.<br>
    The Enterprise is en route to a<br>
    briefing on the situation in the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone along the<br>
    Cardassian border. Meanwhile, we<br>
    are celebrating the return of an<br>
    old friend.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> where a reception is in progress for RO LAREN --<br>
    there's a buffet table, drinks, and some quiet music in<br>
    the background.</p>
  <p> Everyone's excited about seeing Ro, and when she<br>
    ENTERS, she is approached by TROI, BEVERLY and GEORDI.<br>
    She's not entirely comfortable about the fuss that's<br>
    being made over her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Welcome home.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Thanks. It's good to be back.</p>
  <p> Troi gestures to Ro's new collar pip.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Congratulations on your promotion --<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> And Ro returns the gesture --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Same to you -- Commander.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    I hear Advanced Tactical Training<br>
    is a real picnic...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi is obviously teasing her in order to give her<br>
    the chance to tell them something about what she's been<br>
    up to, but Ro just smiles wryly at his comment.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Right...</p>
  <p> There's a slight lull in the conversation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Did you see the buffet?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, that's real Bajoran foraiga.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It wasn't easy to find.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You shouldn't have gone to all<br>
    this trouble...</p>
  <p> The others wave her comment off.</p>
  <p>3 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Ro sees him walking out of Ten Forward -- the one<br>
    person she might have wanted to spend time with.</p>
  <p>4 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Where the conversation is at a bit of a standstill.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where are your new quarters?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Deck eight, section four.</p>
  <p> Again, Ro doesn't take the conversational opportunity --<br>
    she's just not good at these sorts of gatherings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What do you plan to --</p>
  <p> Suddenly Picard's COM VOICE interrupts.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Picard to Lieutenant Ro.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Go ahead, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Please report to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Excuse me.</p>
  <p> We follow Ro as she crosses to the door, and EXITS to --</p>
  <p>5 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> where she's surprised to find Picard standing there<br>
    waiting for her with a faint smile on his face.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You seemed a bit overwhelmed by<br>
    all the attention... I thought you<br>
    could use a break.</p>
  <p> She smiles when he realizes that he pulled her away as<br>
    a favor.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    To tell you the truth, I could...<br>
    I want to see everyone, but I<br>
    think I'd rather do it one at a<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges that he understands. It's obvious<br>
    that they're both very happy to see each other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're looking fit, Lieutenant.<br>
    Tactical Training must have agreed<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You know me -- I enjoy a<br>
    challenge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That school is more than a<br>
    challenge. Half the class washes<br>
    out every year.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Somehow I knew you wouldn't be one<br>
    of those.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I want you to know I appreciate<br>
    your recommending me.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If it weren't for you, sir -- my<br>
    life would be a much different one<br>
    right now.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at her. He has an almost paternal<br>
    feeling about this young renegade.</p>
  <p> Suddenly RIKER'S COM VOICE interrupts.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Bridge to Captain --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> where Riker has the Bridge. N.D.s as needed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're receiving a distress signal<br>
    from a Cardassian ship near the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone.</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Change course to intercept -- I'm<br>
    on my way.<br>
    (to Ro)<br>
    I'd like you at the Conn,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> They head off down the corridor.</p>
  <p>8 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as Picard and Ro ENTER from the Turbolift and take<br>
    their positions. We're at red alert. WORF is at<br>
    Tactical, DATA at Ops.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Cardassian ship relayed a<br>
    distress signal but it was cut off<br>
    before they could tell us what was<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I've got the ship on long-range<br>
    sensors.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It appears to be under attack --<br>
    by several small ships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you identify them?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    No, sir. They aren't transmitting<br>
    identification codes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will scan their warp signatures.</p>
  <p> A beat as Data works...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, sensors indicate that the<br>
    attacking vessels are Federation<br>
    ships.</p>
  <p> Off this moment --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hurtles by at impulse.</p>
  <p>10 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We're coming into visual range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> On the VIEWSCREEN we see a Cardassian ship being<br>
    strafed by several smaller MAQUIS SHIPS -- Picard and<br>
    Riker react to their appearance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Those are Federation ships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isolate one and magnify.</p>
  <p> On the Viewscreen we see one of the Maquis ships closer<br>
    up -- it does not have Starfleet markings, or markings<br>
    of any kind. Picard recognizes it anyway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Maquis...<br>
    (beat, grim)<br>
    Open a channel.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console, indicates a channel is open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To all Maquis ships -- call off<br>
    your attack or we will be forced<br>
    to engage you.</p>
  <p> After a moment --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No response.</p>
  <p> Picard is not happy about this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are Federation citizens. Your<br>
    actions are in violation of our<br>
    treaty with the Cardassians. Call<br>
    off your attack.</p>
  <p> Again, no response. Picard is left with no other<br>
    choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are we in firing range?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not yet, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Arm phasers and photon torpedoes<br>
    and stand by.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I never thought we'd be firing on<br>
    our own people to protect a<br>
    Cardassian ship...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Maquis ships are regrouping...<br>
    they are closing in on the<br>
    Cardassian vessel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The Cardassian's shields are down<br>
    to thirty percent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They may not be able to withstand<br>
    another hit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, we are within weapons range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, can you detonate a<br>
    torpedo spread between the Maquis<br>
    ships and the Cardassians?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console and hears the SOUND of the<br>
    torpedoes firing --</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - STOCK SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the torpedoes shoot out from the ship's hull.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two Maquis ships are in frame, flying in formation.<br>
    Suddenly a photon burst dead ahead causes them to veer<br>
    sharply away and scatter.</p>
  <p>13 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Maquis are breaking formation --<br>
    they are withdrawing.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker share a look of relief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Signal the Cardassians that we're<br>
    standing by to assist them if they<br>
    have any wounded.</p>
  <p> OFF this moment...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> near the Cardassian ship.</p>
  <p>15 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> where Beverly is treating GUL EVEK, last seen in<br>
    &quot;Journey's End.&quot;</p>
  <p> Several other N.D. CARDASSIANS are being treated by<br>
    N.D. Starfleet Personnel in the background, and Evek<br>
    keeps looking around to make sure they're all right,<br>
    making Beverly's task that much tougher.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Do your people have experience<br>
    treating Cardassians?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. Now please, sit still.</p>
  <p> Evek lets out a frustrated breath. Picard ENTERS and<br>
    approaches. Beverly moves off to treat someone else.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gul Evek. I'm sorry we weren't<br>
    able to come to your aid sooner.</p>
  <p> Gul Evek's response is far from grateful --</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    I suppose we're lucky you came at<br>
    all... lately Starfleet seems to<br>
    look the other way when the Maquis<br>
    attack.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assure you that's not the case.<br>
    We're doing everything we can to<br>
    control them.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    (with cold irony)<br>
    The fact that they attacked my<br>
    ship suggests your efforts have<br>
    met with limited success.</p>
  <p> He fixes Picard with a look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    The Maquis came at us with photon<br>
    torpedoes and type eight phasers --<br>
    tell me, Captain, how do you<br>
    suppose a group of civilians<br>
    acquired that kind of weaponry?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was certainly not through<br>
    official channels.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    You don't think the fact that some<br>
    of the Maquis are former Starfleet<br>
    officers has anything to do with<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> Picard's had just about enough of Gul Evek's<br>
    accusations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet does not condone the<br>
    Maquis' actions in the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Any more than your government<br>
    condones paramilitary actions by<br>
    Cardassian civilians.</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    We have taken measures to deal<br>
    with our colonists who have armed<br>
    themselves.</p>
  <p> Picard throws Evek's words back at him --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Considering that they destroyed a<br>
    Juhryan freighter less than a week<br>
    ago, I'd say your efforts have met<br>
    with limited success.</p>
  <p> Evek leans in to Picard --</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Give our military the right to<br>
    operate in the Zone for one week,<br>
    and we'll put a stop to<br>
    paramilitary activity once and for<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What you're proposing would only<br>
    perpetuate the cycle of violence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUL EVEK<br>
    Captain, if the Maquis aren't<br>
    stopped, this situation is going<br>
    to escalate to the point where the<br>
    Cardassian military will have no<br>
    choice but to take matters into<br>
    its own hands.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's face as Gul Evek's threat sinks in...</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> cruising near Admiral Nechayev's ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. Gul<br>
    Evek and his crew have left the<br>
    Enterprise, and we have proceeded<br>
    to our rendezvous with Admiral<br>
    Nechayev.</p>
  <p>17 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> as Picard and NECHAYEV ENTER. Nechayev looks around,<br>
    as though searching for something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    No Bularian canapes this time,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Twice seemed to be pushing it a<br>
    little...</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    It's just as well.<br>
    (conspiratorial)<br>
    They're extremely fattening.</p>
  <p> Picard gestures her to a seat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You missed Gul Evek by a matter of<br>
    hours. I asked him to stay -- I<br>
    thought perhaps an admiral's<br>
    assurances would convince him that<br>
    we are trying to deal with the<br>
    Maquis situation.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    Evek manages to make the<br>
    Cardassians sound like helpless<br>
    sheep being preyed on by<br>
    Federation wolves. The truth is,<br>
    we caught the Cardassian<br>
    government supplying its colonies<br>
    in the Demilitarized Zone with<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (for what it's worth)<br>
    Gul Evek assures me that practice<br>
    has stopped.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Ah. How comforting.</p>
  <p> Nechayev seems a little more stressed than usual.<br>
    Picard stares closely at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral... this Maquis situation<br>
    has you worried...</p>
  <p> Nechayev gives him a look. The general thawing between<br>
    them allows her to be more vulnerable with him.</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    It's a mess... and it just keeps<br>
    getting worse. I never imagined<br>
    I'd have to worry about Federation<br>
    citizens doing violence to others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Frankly, I can understand why our<br>
    colonists have taken up arms --<br>
    Starfleet isn't there to protect<br>
    them anymore.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Believe me, Captain, if I were<br>
    living that close to the<br>
    Cardassians I'd keep a phaser<br>
    under my pillow, too.</p>
  <p> This is a rare moment of candor from her -- another<br>
    sign of improvement in their relationship.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But in the last few weeks we've<br>
    seen signs that the Maquis are<br>
    moving beyond self-defense. Their<br>
    ranks are growing... they've<br>
    acquired ships, weapons... they<br>
    seem to be preparing for a more<br>
    aggressive military posture.</p>
  <p> Nechayev takes a breath... shakes her head at the sorry<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have to put a stop to them...<br>
    before the entire Demilitarized<br>
    Zone ignites.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But before we can stop them -- we<br>
    have to find them. They seem to<br>
    be scattered in small cells around<br>
    the Zone. And we don't have<br>
    reliable intelligence about any of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you need an undercover<br>
    operative.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Our thinking exactly. We intend<br>
    to infiltrate their organization.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And the person we want to do it is<br>
    aboard your ship right now.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's questioning look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>18 INT. RO'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> where Picard has just told her Nechayev's plan.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Starfleet wants me to infiltrate<br>
    the Maquis?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because of your recent training...<br>
    because you're Bajoran... and<br>
    because of your past troubles with<br>
    Starfleet -- you'll have a certain<br>
    credibility.</p>
  <p> Ironically, Picard interrupted Ro while she was<br>
    unpacking her belongings. These are the smaller,<br>
    windowless quarters.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Well, that's certainly true.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She continues unpacking, perturbed, not thrilled by<br>
    this idea. Picard watches her carefully, understanding<br>
    her conflicting emotions.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And just when would this mission<br>
    begin?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Immediately.</p>
  <p> Ro shoots him a glance.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> She pulls things out of her bag, smoothing and<br>
    refolding, using the activity to quiet her mind.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've spent the better part of my<br>
    life fighting the Cardassians...<br>
    I never thought I'd be helping<br>
    them out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is a rare case where our<br>
    interests coincide with theirs --<br>
    we both want peace in the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone.</p>
  <p> Ro stares down at the articles of clothing in her hand.<br>
    Solemnly --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I've heard a lot about the Maquis.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One of my instructors in Tactical<br>
    Training... a Lieutenant Commander<br>
    in Starfleet -- a man I admired<br>
    and respectded... was sympathetic<br>
    to them. He resigned and left to<br>
    join them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're all sympathetic, Lieutenant.<br>
    Our civilian population in the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone is in a<br>
    difficult situation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But sympathy ends at a certain<br>
    point. The peace treaty isn't<br>
    just a piece of paper. If the<br>
    Maquis force us into a war with<br>
    Cardassia, it could mean hundreds<br>
    of thousands of lives.</p>
  <p> Ro nods an acknowledgement; she understands what's at<br>
    stake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Laren, two years ago, Starfleet<br>
    would never have tapped you for<br>
    this mission. They must have a<br>
    lot of confidence in you now.</p>
  <p> She turns to him, the man who's done so much for her,<br>
    always believed in her.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The way I see it... there's at<br>
    least one good reason to take this<br>
    mission, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's to validate your faith in<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Picard and she share a smile as they think of<br>
    everything they've been through together... Off this<br>
    moment we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a shot of a planet from space.</p>
  <p>20 INT. ALIEN BAR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A seedy joint on some planet in the Demilitarized Zone.<br>
    Its patrons are a motley mix -- humans, Bajorans, and<br>
    a few Aliens.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS and Ro ENTERS -- she's dressed in wornlooking<br>
    civilian clothes. She casts a nervous look<br>
    around, then moves toward the back of the bar -- we<br>
    immediately get the feeling she's in trouble, trying to<br>
    hide from someone.</p>
  <p> Several patrons take note of Ro's entrance -- including<br>
    a HUMAN MALE at the bar, SANTOS. This is the kind of<br>
    place where no one asks questions, so Ro is left alone.<br>
    She sits on a bench against the back wall of the bar,<br>
    near a HUMANOID who casts a baleful glance at her and<br>
    then returns to his drink. Nearby, a male alien is<br>
    being entertained by an alien prostitute -- they're<br>
    kissing and laughing quietly to themselves.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the door bursts OPEN and Worf and Data ENTER<br>
    with an urgent step -- they're looking for someone.</p>
  <p> Ro immediately slides over to the HUMANOID and sits on<br>
    his lap, her back to Worf and Data -- his eyes go wide<br>
    but before he can say anything she starts kissing him,<br>
    pretending to be a prostitute. He doesn't resist.</p>
  <p> All eyes are on Worf and Data, who quickly reconnoiter<br>
    the area -- nothing here, just some alien schlubs and<br>
    a couple of hookers in the back corner.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are looking for a Bajoran<br>
    woman, dark hair.</p>
  <p> They are met with blank stares -- no one wants to get<br>
    involved.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She is responsible for the death<br>
    of a Cardassian soldier.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Again, no one volunteers anything. The human at the<br>
    bar, Santos, glances back at Ro -- he's definitely<br>
    putting it together. Worf glares at the bartender.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If we learn that she has been<br>
    here, this establishment will be<br>
    closed down.</p>
  <p> Santos steps forward.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    You say she had dark hair?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> There's beat in which we think he's going to give her<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    She was here... you just missed<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you know where she went?</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Worf and Data exchange a glance, and then move toward<br>
    the door. Worf casts a last scowl at the patrons, then<br>
    they EXIT. Ro immediately extricates herself from the<br>
    humanoid --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Nice meeting you --</p>
  <p> He's disappointed to lose her, but Ro is already up and<br>
    away before he can protest. She turns to Santos.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> With that, she crosses to the bar and orders. Santos<br>
    watches her for a beat, then follows.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Did you kill that Cardassian?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Ro studies his face before replying. She knows he took<br>
    a risk lying for her, but she can't be sure why he did<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Starfleet thinks I did. That's<br>
    reason enough to hide.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Why did you tell them I'd left?</p>
  <p> Now it's his turn to study her face. The bartender<br>
    slides a drink in front of Ro.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    There are worse things a person<br>
    could do than kill a Cardassian<br>
    soldier.</p>
  <p> They hold each other's gaze for a long moment.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You don't often meet someone<br>
    willing to say that out loud.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    In the Zone, there are a lot of us<br>
    who feel that way.</p>
  <p> She raises her glass slightly.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'd like to meet people like that.</p>
  <p> Santos studies her face for a long beat. Ro takes a<br>
    sip of her drink, when she turns to look at him again<br>
    she sees that he's carrying a small PHASER. She<br>
    reacts, but it's too late -- he FIRES, stunning her and<br>
    causing her to crumple in her seat. Off this moment...</p>
  <p>21 INT. MEETING ROOM</p>
  <p> where Ro is unconscious, laid out on a bench.</p>
  <p> Santos is with two others, a woman named KALITA, and an<br>
    older human male named MACIAS. Macias has a scar on<br>
    his face; his eyes shine with intelligence and<br>
    kindness. Kalita has a phaser.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> All three of them are Maquis. Ro has been brought to<br>
    a town in the DMZ where many of the settlers are Maquis<br>
    or sympathizers. The room has a rough-hewn quality;<br>
    this settlement is on the &quot;frontier.&quot;</p>
  <p> Ro's eyes flutter open.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Don't be afraid. You're not in<br>
    danger here.</p>
  <p> Ro sits up, touches her head to steady herself.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    What's your name?</p>
  <p> Ro doesn't answer, partly because she doesn't know who<br>
    these people are, partly because she's a little groggy.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Did you kill that Cardassian<br>
    soldier?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    The people who saved you from<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Ro looks around at them. She suspects these people are<br>
    Maquis, but she must move cautiously.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Thanks.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I'll be leaving now.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Do you even know what planet<br>
    you're on?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Ronara Prime.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Not anymore.</p>
  <p> Ro reacts --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Where am I then?</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    We're not going to tell you that<br>
    until we know more about you.</p>
  <p> Kalita's tone is colder than the others; she's more<br>
    suspicious of Ro.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Like what?</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Did you kill that Cardassian?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    That's a risky thing to do in the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone. You can end<br>
    up being hunted by Starfleet and<br>
    the Cardassians.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (re: Santos)<br>
    Then... why did he risk bringing<br>
    me here?</p>
  <p> Kalita makes one thing clear.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    We're asking the questions. Who<br>
    are you?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    My name is Ro Laren. I grew up in<br>
    the Bajoran camps...</p>
  <p> Macias smiles his quiet smile.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    That would explain why you have no<br>
    love for Cardassians.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I know what they're capable of.<br>
    They tortured my father to<br>
    death... and forced me to watch.</p>
  <p> Macias shakes his head in sympathy, but Santos and<br>
    Kalita press on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Where do you live now?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Nowhere...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I was a Starfleet officer. But I<br>
    was court martialed and spent time<br>
    in the stockade on Jaros Two. I'm<br>
    not exactly what you'd call<br>
    Starfleet material.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    When were you on Jaros?</p>
  <p> Ro acts like she's losing patience.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    What difference does it make?</p>
  <p> Kalita snaps her back hard.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    We want to check your story. When<br>
    were you there?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Starfleet let me out about three<br>
    years ago because I agreed to do<br>
    some work for them... mostly<br>
    having to do with Bajor. But I<br>
    got tired of watching them placate<br>
    the Cardassians and left.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    You resigned?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Not officially.<br>
    (wry)<br>
    That's part of the reason they're<br>
    looking for me.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    What were you doing on Ronara?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Look, I've answered enough of your<br>
    questions -- I'd like to know who<br>
    you people are.</p>
  <p> Macias decides to give her an answer.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Let's just say... we sympathize<br>
    with those who oppose Cardassia.</p>
  <p> Ro stares at the group for a long moment. Then --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Are you Maquis?</p>
  <p> A small silence. No one gives away a thing.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    What if we were... ?</p>
  <p> Ro faces him squarely.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If you were... then I would ask if<br>
    I could join you and help you<br>
    fight.</p>
  <p> Macias glances over at Santos with a questioning look,<br>
    and Santos nods a yes. Macias turns back to Ro.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    We will check your story.</p>
  <p> Kalita hesitates, but Macias fixes a firm gaze on her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Go ahead. I'll keep an eye on<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> Kalita hands Macias her phaser, and she and Santos<br>
    EXIT... After a moment, he sets the phaser down as if<br>
    unconcerned about Ro, and starts to rub his legs.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My circulation isn't what it used<br>
    to be...</p>
  <p> He looks at her for a beat.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Come... let's stretch our legs.</p>
  <p> He heads for the door, and Ro follows...</p>
  <p>22 EXT. MAQUIS SETTLEMENT - NIGHT</p>
  <p> as Ro and Macias walk through the central square.<br>
    Again, this is a &quot;frontier town&quot; -- it has a rough-hewn<br>
    quality, although there is evidence of Federation<br>
    technology.</p>
  <p> Various N.D. SETTLERS go about their business as Ro<br>
    and Macias walk and talk.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aren't you taking a chance by<br>
    letting me see all this? What if<br>
    my story doesn't check out -- what<br>
    if I'm not who I say I am?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Then we'll have a problem, won't<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> It is a definite threat, but Macias' manner makes the<br>
    statement less ominous.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You are Maquis, aren't you?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Many people here are.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Starfleet considers you outlaws.<br>
    They're afraid you'll destroy the<br>
    peace treaty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    They don't understand the<br>
    situation here in the Zone.</p>
  <p> Ro hears the anger in his voice.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I lived on Juhraya... the colony<br>
    suddenly found itself in<br>
    Cardassian territory when the<br>
    treaty was signed. Some of us<br>
    chose to stay and take our<br>
    chances.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One night I was dragged from my<br>
    bed and beaten. The authorities<br>
    clucked their tongues and agreed<br>
    it was an unfortunate incident...<br>
    and did nothing.</p>
  <p> Ro shakes her head, disturbed.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm not surprised. The<br>
    Cardassians intend to make life so<br>
    unpleasant for Federation citizens<br>
    that they'll leave.</p>
  <p> Macias looks at her, gratified that she understands the<br>
    situation so well.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Exactly. And no one seems to see<br>
    that except the Maquis.</p>
  <p> There is a silence as they walk. Then--</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How old were you when your father<br>
    was killed?</p>
  <p> Ro goes into a shutdown mode. This is something she<br>
    still doesn't talk about easily.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'd rather not talk about it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Macias gives her a look, recognizes the denial, backs<br>
    off. They have drawn near an outdoor cafe (or food<br>
    vendor of some kind). Macias gestures.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Are you hungry? Would you like<br>
    something?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    No. Thank you.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (to vendor)<br>
    Hasperat.</p>
  <p> As the vendor prepares the burrito-like dish --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You like hasperat?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    An old Bajoran friend of mine used<br>
    to make it. Although his was much<br>
    stronger.</p>
  <p> He takes a bite of the sandwich.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    He died years ago... fighting the<br>
    Cardassian occupation of Bajor...<br>
    I miss his company... and his<br>
    hasperat...</p>

  </p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    My father made the strongest<br>
    hasperat you've ever tasted.<br>
    Everything else seems mild by<br>
    comparison.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Did he teach you how to make it?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes. But I haven't tried it in<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you would make the brine for<br>
    truly strong hasperat -- and I<br>
    mean eye-watering, tongue-searing<br>
    strong -- you would make an old<br>
    man very happy.</p>
  <p> Ro smiles at him.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'd enjoy making it again.</p>
  <p> Behind them, Santos and Kalita ENTER the square from a<br>
    building and start to approach them.</p>
  <p> SANTOS (O.S.)<br>
    Macias...</p>
  <p> Macias and Ro turn around. Santos and Kalita move<br>
    nearer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 28.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    I checked with my sources at<br>
    Starfleet...<br>
    (re: Ro)<br>
    Her story's true.</p>
  <p> Macias turns to Ro and smiles.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    I was sure it was.</p>
  <p> Ro is strangely touched by the trust this man has<br>
    demonstrated in her, though she continues to guard<br>
    those feelings well.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Kalita -- she'll stay with you<br>
    until we can find her a room.</p>
  <p> Kalita doesn't respond, but acquiesces. She turns and<br>
    Ro follows her... but allows herself one quick glance<br>
    back at Macias.</p>

  <p>25 EXT. MAQUIS SETTLEMENT - DAY</p>
  <p> Camera MOVES through the square as the citizens go<br>
    about their business on a typical day. It's warm and<br>
    sunny, and people seem to be in a good mood. Camera<br>
    FINDS Ro sitting in the sun, a half-eaten hasperat roll<br>
    at her side. Santos approaches her.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Why aren't you with the others?</p>
  <p> Ro looks up at him, surprised.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Kalita told me to stay here -- she<br>
    had things to do.</p>
  <p> Santos smiles knowingly. He realizes Kalita is trying<br>
    to keep Ro away from the group.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    You've been here a week and she<br>
    still doesn't trust you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Ro looks at him, puzzled.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're meeting to discuss<br>
    strategy...</p>
  <p> Ro realizes Kalita was deliberately excluding her.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    So that's what she meant by<br>
    &quot;things to do.&quot; Kalita reminds<br>
    me of someone I knew during the<br>
    occupation... being a part of the<br>
    resistance was the only thing he<br>
    cared about. It was his identity.</p>
  <p> Santos smiles...</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    That does sound like Kalita...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Don't get me wrong, I was glad to<br>
    have him on my side... but he was<br>
    hard to be around.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sometimes people would stay up<br>
    late... telling stories -- you<br>
    know, trying to forget about our<br>
    troubles for a while. Kanore<br>
    would come out of his tent in a<br>
    huff and tell everyone to be quiet --<br>
    that we should get some rest so<br>
    we'd have &quot;strength for our<br>
    struggle.&quot;</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    What would people do?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    We'd ignore him.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    That sounds like the only way to<br>
    handle a person like that...</p>
  <p> He shoots her a meaningful look.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    I have to go... the meeting's<br>
    about to start.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 29A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He starts to cross away. Ro considers what he said for<br>
    a beat, then decides to follow. Santos sees her and<br>
    waits, a small smile on his face... Off this moment...</p>
  <p>26 INT. MEETING ROOM</p>
  <p> Macias, Kalita and several others are there, including<br>
    a Native American. Santos and Ro ENTER.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Ah... there you are.</p>
  <p> As Ro and Santos take seats...</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We've just heard a disturbing<br>
    rumor.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Another rumor?</p>
  <p> Kalita hears the skepticism in her tone.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    One that I think we should take<br>
    seriously. A trader coming from<br>
    Pendi Two said he could verify<br>
    that the Cardassians are going to<br>
    start supplying their colonists<br>
    with bio-genic weapons.</p>
  <p> This gets Macias' attention.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I thought every shipment coming<br>
    into the Zone was searched...</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    (scoffing at her<br>
    naivete)<br>
    The Cardassians always seem to<br>
    find a way to get around problems<br>
    like that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 30.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    We have to make a preemptive<br>
    strike. Send a message to<br>
    Cardassia that we won't sit still<br>
    and let them kill us with toxins.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Agreed. But we can't mount a<br>
    strike without medical supplies --<br>
    and our stockpile is dangerously<br>
    low.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    If we put in a request for more,<br>
    it'll draw suspicion.</p>
  <p> A moment as they ponder this grim situation. Ro<br>
    hesitates, then --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I can get medical supplies.</p>
  <p> They all turn to stare at her.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I served on the Enterprise. They<br>
    keep extra med-kits on hand for<br>
    relief missions.</p>
  <p> Santos almost finds this amusing.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    You're wanted by Starfleet.<br>
    They're not going to give you medkits<br>
    just because you ask.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I have no intention of asking. I<br>
    intend to take them.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    How? The Enterprise is a<br>
    fortress.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 03/16/94 - ACT TWO 30A.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I know how its security systems<br>
    work. Give me a ship... I can do<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    It's madness...</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    We can't trust her with something<br>
    like this. We don't know anything<br>
    about her.</p>
  <p> Macias holds Ro's eyes for a moment.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    I know... that she can make very<br>
    strong hasperat.</p>
  <p> Ro smiles at him.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    We need medical supplies. I think<br>
    we should let her try.</p>
  <p> A brief hesitation --</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    All right. But I'm going with<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> Macias glances at Ro.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I could use an extra hand at the<br>
    controls. And a witness.</p>
  <p> Macias nods, and Ro and Kalita hold a look, both<br>
    defiant and unyielding.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>27 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a Maquis ship traveling at impulse.</p>
  <p>27A INT. RO'S MAQUIS SHIP</p>
  <p> where we find Kalita sitting in the cockpit -- the ship<br>
    is on auto-pilot. Ro is working on a PANEL in the rear<br>
    of the ship. There's a heavy silence between them --<br>
    Kalita is not only suspicious of Ro, she's skeptical<br>
    that she can do what she promised. After a moment, Ro<br>
    finishes working... as she crosses forward toward the<br>
    cockpit --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I set the transporter confinement<br>
    parameters to maximum -- we should<br>
    be able to fill our hold with<br>
    medical supplies in just a single<br>
    beam out.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    (with irony)<br>
    I had no idea it was going to be<br>
    so easy...</p>
  <p> Ro bristles at Kalita's tone, but thinks better of<br>
    replying in kind... she keeps herself in check. She<br>
    sits in the cockpit and starts working the console.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We're approaching the Federation<br>
    border...</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    How do you plan to get out of the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone without being<br>
    searched at one of the checkpoints?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We're going to cross the border<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Kalita reacts to what seems an improbable claim.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>27A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    There are sensor buoys all along<br>
    the border. If we cross anywhere<br>
    other than a checkpoint, Starfleet<br>
    will send a ship to investigate.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    With the right security codes, we<br>
    can disable the proximity<br>
    detectors on the buoys.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Starfleet changes those codes all<br>
    the time.</p>
  <p> Ro's hands fly across the controls.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I know the encryption algorithims.<br>
    If I can access the bouy's<br>
    protocol subsystem I should be<br>
    able to figure out the codes.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Should be able to?</p>
  <p> As she works:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Do you want this mission to<br>
    succeed?</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Of course I do -- we need those<br>
    medical supplies.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    In that case, let me do my job.</p>
  <p> Kalita is about to reply when there is a beeping SOUND<br>
    from the control panel.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm in...</p>
  <p> Suddenly the console BEEPS a warning. Ro reacts --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>27A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> Ro works the controls with great urgency.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If I don't input the right code in<br>
    the next twenty seconds, we'll<br>
    trigger the proximity alarm.</p>
  <p> Kalita reaches for the helm control.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    I'm getting us out of sensor<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Don't. If we break the com-link,<br>
    we won't be able to try again.</p>
  <p> Kalita withdraws her hand. Ro works with urgency --<br>
    finally, a beep-beep. Ro slumps back into her chair in<br>
    relief.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    It worked... until they change the<br>
    access codes again, we can cross<br>
    the border here.</p>
  <p> Though Kalita doesn't let on, she's impressed with what<br>
    Ro's done. Off this moment...</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47943.2.<br>
    It has been over a week since<br>
    Lieutenant Ro left the<br>
    Enterprise... we have yet to<br>
    receive any communication from<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>31A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker has the Bridge, Data at Ops, Worf at Tactical,<br>
    N.D's as needed. Picard ENTERS from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We picked up a request for<br>
    emergency assistance from a<br>
    Federation science ship in the<br>
    Topin system.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat -- this couldn't have come<br>
    at a worse time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are there any other ships in the<br>
    vicinity?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're the closest.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to the con officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Helm, set course for the Topin<br>
    system.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Signal the science ship that we're<br>
    on our way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is unlikely that they would<br>
    receive our communication. The<br>
    Topin system contains an unstable<br>
    binary-star. It generates<br>
    significant subspace interference.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will we be able to use our sensors<br>
    to find them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Most of our sensor systems will be<br>
    ineffective, although our<br>
    directional array may be able to<br>
    cut through the interference.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>31A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But that array has such a narrow<br>
    scan field...<br>
    (with grim irony)<br>
    -- we might as well break out the<br>
    palm-beacons and try to find them<br>
    that way...</p>
  <p> It seems a daunting prospect... Off this moment...</p>
  <p>31B EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where the Maquis ship hangs motionless. In the b.g.<br>
    we can see the distinctive STAR of the Topin system.</p>
  <p>32 INT. RO'S MAQUIS SHIP</p>
  <p> where Ro and Kalita are waiting. Again, a silence<br>
    hangs between them.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    This is insane... we're sitting<br>
    here with no sensors, blind to the<br>
    outside -- waiting for a galaxy<br>
    class Starship to come swooping<br>
    down on us...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Don't worry... it'll be hard for<br>
    them to locate us with just their<br>
    directional sensors. Besides,<br>
    they're looking for a damaged<br>
    science ship that wants to be<br>
    found...</p>
  <p> Suddenly a console beeps. They react --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    They're here... Standby to engage<br>
    thrusters.</p>

    They're scanning our last<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    All right, I've locked onto their<br>
    sensor beam. I'm going to use it<br>
    to maneuver into transporter<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> Kalita is looking at Ro -- she can't quite believe<br>
    they've come this far.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    How are we going to beam through<br>
    their shields?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We can't -- if we're going to get<br>
    those medical supplies, we're<br>
    going to have to take this ship<br>
    through their shields.</p>
  <p> Off Kalita's astonished reaction at Ro's audacious<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- the computer has<br>

    on the last distress signal...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you decode it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p>32D INT. RO'S MAQUIS SHIP</p>
  <p> where Ro is explaining what she's doing to Kalita.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The Enterprise shields have a weak<br>
    point... When the ship is at<br>
    impulse, the thrust destabilizes<br>
    the shield configuration right at<br>
    this point.</p>
  <p> On the MONITOR, Ro indicates a graphic of the<br>
    Enterprise, and a point directly behind the main<br>
    impulse engines, between the nacelles.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm going to try to punch through<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    Won't they detect us?</p>

  <p>32D CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    They'll know something's<br>
    penetrated the shields, but with<br>
    all the interference it'll take<br>
    them a few seconds to find us.<br>
    We'll have to beam the medical<br>
    supplies aboard and get out fast.</p>
  <p> Kalita tries to assimilate all that's happened... She<br>
    can't quite believe it, but she's beginning to think Ro<br>

  <p> KALITA<br>
    I'll see you later...</p>
  <p> She treats Ro with the easy manner of a friend. Ro<br>
    smiles, and Kalita moves off.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Well... it seems that Kalita's<br>
    decided you're not a Federation<br>
    spy after all...</p>
  <p> Ro manages a smile.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    She's suspicious of everyone at<br>
    first. And rightly so -- we've<br>
    learned to be cautious with<br>
    strangers.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I understand...</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    But I've known since I first met<br>
    you -- in your heart, you're one<br>
    of us...</p>
  <p> Ro is struck by the irony of the moment... but somehow,<br>
    the certainty in Macias' voice strikes a chord in<br>
    her... Off her expression we...</p>

  <p>45 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> where Picard and Ro are meeting. They're both glad to<br>
    see each other...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    There are rumors that the<br>
    Cardassians are supplying their<br>
    colonists with bio-genic weapons.</p>
  <p> Picard can see that she's genuinely concerned about<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Frankly, I find it hard to<br>
    believe. Every ship going into<br>
    the Demilitarized Zone is being<br>
    searched.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The Maquis are convinced that the<br>
    Cardassians have found a way<br>
    around the searches.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We might be able to use that...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Sir... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've come up with a plan that has<br>
    the potential to seriously curtail<br>
    the Maquis.</p>
  <p> This gets Ro's attention.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We want to give them a target so<br>
    threatening -- that they'd be<br>
    willing to commit as many people<br>
    and ships as possible to destroy<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    What do you mean, give them a<br>
    target?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bio-genic weapons, for example.<br>
    You could provide the Maquis with<br>
    intelligence that the Cardassians<br>
    are in fact supplying their<br>
    colonists with them.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    That'll get their attention, all<br>
    right...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You could tell them that in order<br>
    to get past the check-points, the<br>
    Cardassians are shipping the<br>
    components for these weapons<br>
    through third parties. We'll put<br>
    together a convoy and send it<br>
    toward the Demilitarized Zone.</p>
  <p> Ro sees where he's going --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    And when the Maquis attack it,<br>
    Starfleet will be waiting for<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll station our ships in the<br>
    Hugora Nebula to avoid detection.</p>
  <p> Ro is silent for a beat, assimilating Picard's plan...<br>
    and her role in it.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Basically, I'd be leading them<br>
    into a trap...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's correct.</p>
  <p> He studies her face for a beat. Picard senses she's<br>
    feeling conflicting emotions about this.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    If your plan works, what will<br>
    Starfleet do when the Maquis<br>
    attack the convoy?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our intention is to outnumber them<br>
    so heavily that they'll have no<br>
    choice but to surrender.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    These people are used to fighting<br>
    impossible odds -- I don't think<br>
    they're going to surrender.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope you're wrong. Because if<br>
    they don't, we'll have to try to<br>
    disable their vessels...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    -- you know as well as I do that's<br>
    not always possible.</p>
  <p> Picard sees Ro swallow back, hard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If you have a problem with any of<br>
    this, I need to know now.</p>
  <p> She doesn't want to let him down --</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    If I did, it wouldn't stop me from<br>
    carrying out my duty, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard is gratified to hear this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I knew I could count on you...</p>
  <p> Ro manages a small smile... Off this moment...</p>
  <p>46 INT. MEETING ROOM<br>
    (FORMERLY SCENE 41)</p>
  <p> where Ro is in the process of implementing Picard's<br>
    plan -- planting misinformation. Macias, Kalita and<br>
    Santos are present.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    -- it took a while, but I managed<br>
    to patch into Starfleet's comsystem.<br>
    I intercepted a<br>
    communication from one of the<br>
    check-points on the border.<br>
    They're concerned because a Pakled<br>
    transport came through carrying<br>
    retro-viral vaccines.</p>
  <p> No one sees a problem with this --</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    Why is that a concern?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Last week, a Ferengi transport<br>
    came through carrying bio-mimetic<br>
    gels. By themselves, neither of<br>
    these is dangerous. But Starfleet<br>
    is concerned because with a few<br>
    more components the Cardassians<br>
    could put together a bio-genic<br>
    device.</p>
  <p> Reactions. This is their worst fear come to life.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    What is Starfleet going to do<br>
    about it?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    They can't do anything. These<br>
    items are all perfectly legal.</p>
  <p> Frustrated reactions.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    How close are the Cardassians to<br>
    having the components they need?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Very close. Two days ago, a<br>
    Yridian convoy left Deep Space<br>
    Nine for the Demilitarized Zone.<br>
    It's carrying isomiotic hypos,<br>
    plasma flares and quarantine pods.</p>
  <p> KALITA<br>
    We can't let that convoy reach its<br>
    destination.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SANTOS<br>
    But it's too big for us to go<br>
    after alone.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    I'll discuss the situation with<br>
    the other cell leaders --<br>
    considering what's at stake,<br>
    they'll want to help.</p>
  <p> With that, the meeting starts to break up. Ro takes a<br>
    moment to collect herself -- it worked, but she doesn't<br>
    know how she feels about it.</p>
  <p>47 EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Ro sits watching the busy square full of citizens.<br>
    THREE HOODED MONKS are seen in the b.g. Macias<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    I've sent a communication to the<br>
    others...</p>
  <p> She nods glumly, and Macias sees that something is on<br>
    her mind.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When this is over, we'll<br>
    celebrate.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    When it's over?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    When Cardassia realizes they can't<br>
    intimidate us into leaving our<br>
    colonies.</p>
  <p> Ro smiles grimly.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Something tells me it might be a<br>
    long time before we'll be<br>
    celebrating.</p>
  <p> He eyes her, hearing her somberness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Don't be discouraged, Ro. It will<br>
    take time... but the important<br>
    thing is that we not give up.</p>
  <p> She eyes him sharply.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I spent ten years in the camps.<br>
    I don't give up.</p>
  <p> He puts a hand on her shoulder, affectionate.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    I've been thinking about what our<br>
    celebration will be like for a<br>
    long time. We'll have a huge<br>
    dinner... you'll make hasperat<br>
    and I'll make blueberry pie...<br>
    we'll drink wine and we'll dance.</p>
  <p> He smiles and leans toward her.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll even play the belaklavion.<br>
    That will give everyone a laugh.</p>
  <p> She looks up at him, curious.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You... play the klavion?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    (laughing, dismissive)<br>
    Yes, badly. It's a difficult<br>
    instrument... but I enjoy the<br>
    challenge.</p>
  <p> There is a small pause.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    My father... played the klavion.</p>
  <p> Macias glances sidelong at her. This is the first<br>
    spontaneous offering Ro has made about her father. He<br>
    is silent. There is another pause, and then Ro<br>
    continues.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    When I was very young... and<br>
    afraid of monsters under my bed...<br>
    my father would play for me. He<br>
    said the sound of the klavion had<br>
    special powers. Monsters were<br>
    afraid of it... and they'd<br>
    disappear whenever they heard it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I listened to the music he<br>
    played for me... I was never<br>
    afraid to go to sleep.</p>
  <p> She hesitates, then, very quietly...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    When he died... I realized... even<br>
    he couldn't make all the monsters<br>
    go away.</p>
  <p> Macias reaches out and covers Ro's hand with his own,<br>
    a comforting gesture.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Why wait... ? Let's go to the<br>
    market. Let's get the food for a<br>
    feast. For a celebration...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    A celebration of what?</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    Of absolutely nothing. Just to<br>
    celebrate.</p>
  <p> She smiles and stands.</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Ro<br>
    I'd like that.</p>
  <p> They start across the square. Suddenly there's a<br>
    commotion -- the three monks throw back their hoods and<br>
    we see that they're really Cardassians. They pull<br>
    weapons from their robes and start FIRING.</p>
  <p> People are scattering and trying to take cover. The<br>
    Cardassians had the advantage of surprise, and have<br>
    taken up strategic positions that provide them shelter<br>
    and allow them to dominate the fight.</p>
  <p> Some of the Maquis are shooting back, but most weren't<br>
    armed when the attack broke out. We see several Maquis<br>
    rush from a door carrying weapons -- they toss them to<br>
    their comrades, including Ro.</p>
  <p>47A ON SANTOS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> behind a structure -- a weapons blast hits it and he<br>

  <p>47C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Macias takes a second Cardassian down, but the last<br>
    Cardassian gets off a lucky shot -- and Macias takes a<br>
    blast in the chest. He falls... and the Cardassian is<br>
    felled by Ro.</p>
  <p> Ro and Kalita run to Macias' side.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Macias...</p>
  <p> He's badly wounded and in pain.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    They must have found out... there<br>
    was a Maquis cell here...</p>
  <p> Ro is inspecting the wound and sees that it's severe.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Kalita -- get one of the med kits.<br>
    Hurry.</p>
  <p> Kalita runs off. Macias is fading fast.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have to hang on...</p>
  <p> He dismisses this with a faint shake of his head. When<br>
    he speaks, his voice is little more than a whisper.</p>
  <p> MACIAS<br>
    When an old fighter like me<br>
    dies... someone always steps<br>
    forward to take his place...</p>
  <p> He takes her hand, looks into her eyes for a last time,<br>
    and smiles his gentle smile...</p>

  <p>B50 INT. BRIDGE<br>
    (FORMERLY SCENE 44)</p>
  <p> Riker has the Bridge. Data is at Aft Science, N.D.s as<br>
    needed. Picard ENTERS from his Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We just got a communication from<br>
    Lieutenant Ro. Data's decoding it<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard approach Data, who turns away from his<br>
    console, finished.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    She is requesting that you meet<br>
    with her.</p>
  <p> Picard is disturbed by this message.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Was that part of your plan?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Something must have gone<br>
    wrong.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>C50 INT. ALIEN BAR<br>

  <p> as Picard ENTERS, dressed in slightly ragged-looking<br>
    civilian clothes. Many of the same motley characters<br>
    are here tonight as well.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't see Ro, and so makes his way to the bar.<br>
    The BARTENDER approaches him to see if he wants<br>
    anything.</p>

  <p>C50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ale.</p>
  <p> Picard pays for his beverage with coins he brought for<br>
    this purpose. The door OPENS and Ro ENTERS. The<br>
    Humanoid she kissed before is sitting near the entrance<br>
    and his eyes light up when he sees her. He stands to<br>
    approach his old flame but Ro fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Not tonight.</p>
  <p> She moves past the disappointed fellow and goes to sit<br>
    next to Picard at the bar. She gives him a come-hither<br>
    smile, as though soliciting him.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello... are you alone?</p>
  <p> Picard turns and gives her an appraising look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope not.</p>
  <p> She smiles again, caressing his cheek.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Why don't we get acquainted... ?<br>
    There's a table in the back that's<br>
    more... private.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like that.</p>
  <p> They make their way to the back table and sit, Ro being<br>
    very physical with him, caressing, holding his hand.<br>
    Picard plays the very eager john. The scene is played<br>
    out as they talk serious business while outwardly<br>
    appearing to be engaging in casual romanticizing.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We have to cancel the mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    The Maquis didn't go for the bait.<br>
    They think a convoy is too big a<br>
    target.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>C50 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> This makes no sense to Picard. He considers for a beat<br>
    as Ro traces her fingers on his palm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But there are only six ships. We<br>
    could even cut down the number.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    It's... it's the commitment of<br>
    resources... of grouping so many<br>
    of the Maquis together at once...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They feel it would make them too<br>
    vulnerable.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns, trying to reconcile what she's saying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Every intelligence report I get<br>
    from Starfleet suggests that the<br>
    Maquis are eager to expand their<br>
    strikes... are looking to escalate<br>
    their activity... but you're<br>
    telling me that's not true... ?</p>
  <p> Ro takes a moment, trying to cover.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    It's... probably different in<br>
    every cell. The people I've met<br>
    tend to be more -- conservative.<br>
    I'm sure others have a more<br>
    militant attitude...</p>
  <p> He stares at her. None of this rings true.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Laren... what's going on?</p>
  <p> She takes his look for a moment, then glances around<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Do you have the money I asked you<br>
    to bring?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Put some on the table.</p>

  <p>C50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    By this time, we should be<br>
    negotiating my price.</p>
  <p> Picard digs into his pocket, takes out a few coins. Ro<br>
    picks one up, inspects it.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When you sent me on this mission,<br>
    I thought I could do it. Even<br>
    though it meant helping<br>
    Cardassians. Even though it meant<br>
    betraying people who were fighting<br>
    them.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But now... I'm not sure about<br>
    where I stand.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Laren, are you telling me you want<br>
    to back out of this mission?</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Sir, I don't want to let you down,<br>
    I swear I don't --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This has nothing to do with me --<br>
    it's about you. If you back out<br>
    now, you'll be throwing away<br>
    everything you've worked for.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (desperately reaching)<br>
    Wouldn't it be better to postpone<br>
    this operation... let me stay with<br>
    them longer, meet other Maquis<br>
    leaders... learn where their cells<br>
    are... it seems to me I could be<br>
    more valuable if I had more<br>
    time...</p>

    And just prolong the inevitable?<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We're committed to this mission.<br>
    My only question to you is -- can<br>
    you carry out your orders?</p>
  <p> Wretched, Ro looks at him, not answering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant... I could put you<br>
    before a board of inquiry for<br>
    having lied to me about this<br>
    operation. I could certainly have<br>
    you court martialed if you<br>
    sabotage it.<br>

    threaten you to do this... I want<br>
    you to make the decision.</p>
  <p> This is the man who gave her a chance. This is the man<br>
    who has stood by her. And all he wants is what's right<br>
    for her.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'll carry out my orders, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a breath, considers his options.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I feel it necessary to have<br>
    Commander Riker return with you.<br>
    He can pose as a relative.</p>
  <p> Her look asks the question: is that necessary?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    To make sure nothing happens that<br>
    might obstruct this mission.</p>
  <p> Ro looks down, acknowledging the fact that she's<br>
    ruptured their relationship. He can no longer trust<br>
    her.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (loudly)<br>
    Sorry -- I don't have that kind of<br>

  <p> He turns and EXITS the bar. Off Ro's face as she<br>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, supplemental. We<br>
    have received word from Commander<br>
    Riker and Lieutenant Ro that the<br>
    Maquis will be attacking the<br>
    convoy as planned... our ships<br>
    have taken up position in the<br>
    Hugora Nebula to wait for them.</p>
  <p>52 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf are at an aft station with Data,<br>
    looking at a sensor readout on a MONITOR. The readout<br>
    shows a section of space on a grid -- on the left edge<br>
    we see the nebula, and in the center, the convoy,<br>
    depicted as a series of blips. Along the right side a<br>
    line demarcates the border of the DMZ.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have established a relay-link<br>
    with the sensor probe we left on<br>
    the perimeter of the Nebula.<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    This is the convoy. We are<br>
    expecting the Maquis attack force<br>
    to cross the border from the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone here.</p>
  <p> He indicates the right edge of the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As soon as they cross the border,<br>
    we'll intercept them...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    In order to insure that the ship<br>
    Commander Riker and Lieutenant Ro<br>
    are piloting does not come under<br>
    fire, I have relayed its warp<br>
    signature to the rest of our<br>
    attack force.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to something on the monitor, calls the<br>
    Captain's attention to the screen, where a few blips<br>
    have entered from the right edge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the Maquis squadron is coming<br>
    into sensor range.</p>

  <p> a squadron of Maquis ships flying in formation at<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p>54 INT. RO'S MAQUIS SHIP</p>
  <p> Riker and Ro are silent as they pilot the ship for a<br>
    beat. She's about to betray a group of people she's<br>
    come to care about and she feels awful about it.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starfleet can't make its move<br>
    until we're out of the<br>
    Demilitarized Zone. We're to<br>
    break formation and take cover in<br>
    the Nebula as soon as they appear.</p>
  <p> Ro takes this in without comment.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The ships in the convoy are<br>
    raising their shields... they've<br>
    spotted us.</p>
  <p> Riker checks his console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We cross the border in thirty<br>
    seconds...</p>
  <p> As the moment approaches, the turmoil within Ro<br>
    intensifies. We see a look cross her features, as if<br>
    she's come to a decision within herself.</p>
  <p> She reaches forward and calmly works a control. After<br>
    a beat, we hear the SOUND of a power surge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What the --</p>
  <p> When Riker turns toward her he sees that she has a HAND<br>
    PHASER aimed at him.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    I'm sorry... but I can't let this<br>
    happen.</p>
  <p> Off his stunned reaction...</p>

    Sir, the vessel being piloted by<br>
    Lieutenant Ro is firing a low-intensity<br>
    particle beam into the<br>
    Nebula...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What the hell is she doing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The polarizing effect created by<br>
    the beam may make it possible for<br>
    us to be detected.</p>
  <p> Picard's face hardens --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you counter the effect?</p>
  <p> Data works his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will attempt to do so.</p>

  <p> SANTOS'S COM VOICE<br>
    Ro, why are you firing?</p>

    Starfleet attack force hiding<br>
    inside it.</p>

    No, sir. They are withdrawing...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Picard's tone says it all -- he feels personally<br>
    betrayed by her. Off this moment...</p>
  <p>68 INT. RO'S MAQUIS SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ro works the controls for a few beats, careful to keep<br>
    the phaser trained on Riker. Finally she finishes and<br>
    stands, avoiding Riker's gaze.</p>

  <p> Ro and Riker look at each other for a beat.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    You can take this ship back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're going with them?</p>
  <p> There's more concern in his voice than anger.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Yes... it's been a long time since<br>
    I felt like I really belonged<br>
    somewhere.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges.</p>

  <p> RO<br>
    Could you tell Captain Picard<br>
    something for me?</p>
  <p> Riker nods that he will.</p>
  <p> RO<br>

    Tell him... that I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> She moves to the center of the cockpit, ready for beam<br>

    So long, Ro. Take care of<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    She seemed... very sure that she<br>
    was making the right choice.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I think her only real regret...<br>
    was that she let you down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot; - REV. 3/16/94 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> But Picard isn't buying it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She let us all down...</p>
  <p> Riker hands Picard a PADD he's carrying.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Here's my report...</p>
  <p> Picard nods, and Piker turns and EXITS.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at the PADD... we see a distant look<br>
    in his eyes -- he's not reading it, his mind is<br>
    elsewhere. After a moment, he sets it down on the<br>
    desk, and moves toward the window.</p>
  <p> He looks out at the stars... thinking about the events<br>
    of the last few days, wondering, perhaps, if he'll ever<br>
    see Ro again... Off this moment...</p>
