    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Red Alert! PICARD, DATA and a few N.D's are dealing<br>
    with what is clearly an urgent situation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    We are losing containment in the<br>
    starboard nacelle tube --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try to get more power to the field<br>
    coils.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi, report.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> where GEORDI and a few N.D's are trying to contain the<br>
    situation. The WARP CORE is pulsing at an accelerated<br>
    rate, giving off an enormous SOUND.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't shut down the plasma<br>
    injectors -- someone's locked out<br>
    the controls.</p>
  <p>3 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The plasma venting system has<br>
    engaged.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where we can see DRIVE PLASMA escaping from the<br>
    starboard nacelle into space.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>5 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> as RIKER and WORF scramble up the ladder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two more decks --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hits combadge)<br>
    Riker to Bridge -- we've almost<br>
    reached the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Release the exterior hull plate.<br>
    We may have to jettison the core.</p>
  <p> Data acknowledges and works his console.</p>
  <p>7 INT. NACELLE CONTROL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Riker and Worf ENTER from a Jefferies tube junction<br>
    and stop in their tracks at what they see -- their<br>
    faces are lit by INTERACTIVE LIGHT as they take in the<br>
    strange scene before them.</p>
  <p> This control room is situated at the forward end of the<br>
    starboard nacelle. In addition to wall panels, there<br>
    is a free standing console with work stations on both<br>
    sides. There is an access DOOR in the back wall that<br>
    leads into the injector room.</p>
  <p> A ladder leads to a catwalk above -- there is an<br>
    OBSERVATION WINDOW in the wall through which it is<br>
    possible to see into the injector room, and beyond<br>
    that, the nacelle tube itself. When the plasma stream<br>
    is on, as it is now, its fiery glow obscures these<br>
    structures.</p>
  <p> A TRANSLUCENT MAINTENANCE DOOR can drop down to cover<br>
    the window -- but even then the intense light of the<br>
    plasma bleeds through.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are startled upon entering the room<br>
    because a man is standing on the catwalk, poised to<br>
    jump through the forecefield and into the plasma.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He is LIEUTENANT KWAN, a humanoid in his mid-thirties --<br>
    part Asian, part Napean. He is clearly agitated and<br>
    distraught.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to LIEUTENANT NARA, who along with an N.D,<br>
    is standing motionless, unsure what to do. She is<br>
    humanoid, in her mid-thirties.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    He locked out the controls...<br>
    before we knew what was happening,<br>
    he stepped up onto the walkway.</p>
  <p> Riker gestures for Worf to go to a console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    See if you can shut down the<br>
    plasma flow.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges and moves away.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    I'm afraid if we try to get any<br>
    closer, he'll jump through the<br>
    forecefield.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges, turns to Kwan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dan...</p>
  <p>8 ON KWAN</p>
  <p> facing the plasma stream, his face lit by its glow --<br>
    Riker can be seen behind him. Riker takes a cautious<br>
    step toward him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's me... Wil Riker.</p>
  <p> Kwan doesn't seem to react to the name...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was here yesterday, remember?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Something registers on Kwan's face -- he looks down at<br>
    his hands, seems horrified by what he sees there.<br>
    Although we see nothing, he wipes his hands on his<br>
    uniform, as if to clean them. When he speaks, it is in<br>
    the tones of a man confessing a wretched crime.</p>
  <p> KWAN<br>
    I didn't... want to do it...<br>
    but... I saw them... and... they<br>
    laughed at me... they laughed...</p>
  <p> Kwan is clearly in agony about this... though Riker has<br>
    no idea what he's talking about, he knows he needs to<br>
    try and calm him down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whatever happened, we can talk<br>
    about it. I want to help.</p>
  <p> Riker starts to climb the ladder to the catwalk.</p>
  <p> KWAN<br>
    Stay away!</p>
  <p> Riker stops --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I want you to be able to see me,<br>
    that's all... so we can talk.</p>
  <p> KWAN<br>
    I... know... what I have to do...</p>
  <p> He takes a half-step toward the plasma stream.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dan, wait --</p>
  <p>9 ON WORF AND NARA</p>
  <p> at the console, working to free the controls.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have unlocked the controls --</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Shut down procedure initiated.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    There's still plasma in the<br>
    injector -- it'll take time to<br>
    vent off...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>10 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker has taken note of the fact that the plasma stream<br>
    will soon dissipate -- he knows he needs to keep Kwan<br>
    from jumping until it does.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tell me what happened. Maybe I<br>
    can help.</p>
  <p> But Kwan is staring intently into the stream, seems<br>
    strangely calmed by it.</p>
  <p> KWAN<br>
    I know what I have to do...</p>
  <p> Riker senses what he's about to do and makes a sudden<br>
    move toward him... but it's too late... Kwan has<br>
    already started to move... Riker misses him by half a<br>
    step and Kwan jumps through the FORCEFIELD and into the<br>
    stream -- he is instantly VAPORIZED.</p>
  <p> Riker stops in mid-stride -- so close. Off Riker's<br>
    expression as he realizes how close they came to saving<br>
    Kwan's life...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p>12 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are reporting what happened to Picard<br>
    and TROI.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A few more seconds and we could've<br>
    saved his life...</p>
  <p> Riker clearly feels that he should have been able to<br>
    talk Kwan down.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander... you did everything<br>
    you could. It was not your fault.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges, but can't quite shake the feeling.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I had the strangest feeling<br>
    that... he didn't even recognize<br>
    me -- and I was with him just the<br>
    other day when I supervised the<br>
    tube refit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did he seem then?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine. In fact I complimented him<br>
    for getting the refit done faster<br>
    than expected. He was pleased<br>
    that I noticed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I met with him during crew<br>
    evaluations about six weeks ago.<br>
    He was very positive; he was<br>
    looking forward to being posted to<br>
    the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/21/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He was a fine officer, with a good<br>
    career ahead of him. I just don't<br>
    understand why he would want to...</p>
  <p> Riker trails off, shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In my years as a Starship Captain,<br>
    I've had to notify many families<br>
    that they'd lost a loved one. But<br>
    never to suicide. I'd like to be<br>
    able to offer Lieutenant Kwan's<br>
    family some explanation for what<br>
    happened -- to help them make<br>
    sense of it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He may have left a message of some<br>
    kind, explaining why he did it.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges this possibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi and Worf)<br>
    I want the two of you to try and<br>
    piece together a picture of his<br>
    last few days.</p>
  <p> Troi and Worf acknowledge.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If he made any personal logs, it<br>
    might be helpful to go through<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're authorized to do so.</p>
  <p> A Com signal SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge to Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p>13 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> where Geordi is working at a console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've completed a damage<br>
    assessment. We should be able to<br>
    get underway within the hour.</p>
  <p>14 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi, the medical situation on<br>
    Barson Two has worsened --<br>
    Starfleet has given us permission<br>
    to exceed warp speed limitations<br>
    so we can get back on schedule.</p>
  <p>15 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll be able to give you warp<br>
    eight if you need it.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Geordi returns to work. After a moment, Data<br>
    approaches him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, would you agree that the<br>
    instinct for self-preservation is<br>
    shared by most life forms?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd say it's probably the most<br>
    basic instinct.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That being the case, I am having<br>
    difficulty understanding why<br>
    someone would deliberately<br>
    terminate their own existence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know, Data. All I can<br>
    think is that maybe Lieutenant<br>
    Kwan felt like there was<br>
    something... wrong in his life,<br>
    something he felt powerless to<br>
    fix.</p>
  <p> Data takes this in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I understand. I have<br>
    been in a similar situation.</p>
  <p> Geordi's a little surprised to hear this.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The first months following my<br>
    activation were a difficult period<br>
    for me... there were many<br>
    problems associated with my<br>
    becoming sentient.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Because your neural net was still<br>
    forming.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As I acquired new skills, neural<br>
    pathways would form and take the<br>
    place of other, less complex<br>
    pathways. It was very...<br>
    disorienting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure sounds like it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As my systems grew in complexity,<br>
    it became increasingly difficult<br>
    to integrate new pathways into my<br>
    existing neural net. The<br>
    probability of cascade failure<br>
    grew with each added pathway. I<br>
    came to the conclusion that it<br>
    would be easier and safer to shut<br>
    myself down and start again.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But if you did that, you wouldn't<br>
    have remembered any of the things<br>
    that had happened to you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In a way, it would have been<br>
    like... committing suicide.</p>
  <p> Geordi acknowledges Data's point.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So what did you do?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I decided against the procedure.<br>
    I chose instead to treat the<br>
    problems I was having with my<br>
    systems as... challenges to be<br>
    overcome, instead of obstacles to<br>
    be avoided.</p>
  <p> Geordi studies his friend's face for a beat; once<br>
    again, Data has shown facets of himself no one knew he<br>
    had.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's a great way of looking at<br>
    it. It's too bad Lieutenant Kwan<br>
    wasn't able to look at his<br>
    problems the same way.</p>
  <p> Data acknowledges his sentiment, and after a beat, they<br>
    return to work...</p>
  <p>16 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Worf and Troi make their way down it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've gone over Kwan's personnel<br>
    records -- he had an exceptionally<br>
    stable psychological profile.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When we were in the control room,<br>
    it seemed as if he were trying<br>
    to... explain something he'd<br>
    done... something terrible.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He'd been on the Enterprise over<br>
    two years. No one has ever<br>
    reported an altercation with him.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges and gestures to a DOOR along the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These were his quarters.</p>
  <p> He works a KEYPAD on the wall and the door OPENS.</p>
  <p>17 INT. KWAN'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> These are the smaller, windowless quarters. There are<br>
    CHINESE and ALIEN ARTIFACTS in evidence, reflecting<br>
    Kwan's mixed heritage. Everything is neat and orderly.</p>
  <p> Troi and Worf step inside... they stand silently for a<br>
    moment, almost out of respect for the dead. After a<br>
    beat, Worf moves to a nearby table and picks up an<br>
    ALIEN looking ARTIFACT.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This is a Napean design...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    His mother is Napean; his father's<br>
    human.</p>
  <p> He studies the artifact for a beat, then sets it down.<br>
    Troi looks around the room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Everything looks so... normal.<br>
    For some reason I was half<br>
    expecting to find the place a<br>
    mess.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... it is strange to think that<br>
    someone could be considering<br>
    ending his life and yet not give<br>
    any outward sign of it.</p>
  <p> They continue moving around the room, looking for<br>
    something that might provide a clue.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Right before he jumped, he seemed<br>
    almost... calm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He must have been in a lot of pain<br>
    to do what he did. It could be<br>
    that the prospect of ending that<br>
    pain felt like a great relief.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf moves to look at something on the wall. Troi<br>
    finds a PHOTOGRAPH of a young woman, a pretty human of<br>
    about thirty. She turns to show it to Worf just as he<br>
    turns away from the wall, so that they almost bump into<br>
    one another -- there's a moment where they're standing<br>
    very close, then Troi shows Worf the photograph.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is Ensign... Calloway, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> Worf looks at the photo, acknowledges.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    She is a medical technician in<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Troi's face registers sympathy for Calloway.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's always hard to lose someone<br>
    you care about... but to lose them<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> They study the picture for a beat, then she sets it<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We should start going over his<br>
    logs...</p>
  <p> They move to a DESKTOP COMPUTER TERMINAL -- Troi sits<br>
    and activates it, Worf leans in to look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is his last entry; he made it<br>
    before going on duty this morning.</p>
  <p> Kwan's face appears on the MONITOR.</p>
  <p> KWAN<br>
    Personal log, Stardate 47622.1.<br>
    We finally finished the nacelle<br>
    tube refit last night. After<br>
    pulling two double shifts in a<br>
    row, I'm really looking forward to<br>
    spending some time with Maddy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ensign Calloway...</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi are struck by how upbeat Kwan seems, and<br>
    puzzled that he seemed to be making plans.</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That doesn't sound like a man<br>
    planning on ending his life.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... it does not...</p>
  <p> Off the mystery of the moment...</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels at warp.</p>
  <p>19 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> as Troi and CALLOWAY ENTER from Sickbay so they can<br>
    talk in private. The young woman is clearly destroyed<br>
    by what's happened.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    I can't believe he's really<br>
    gone... I keep thinking he's<br>
    going to show up and tell me<br>
    there's been some terrible<br>
    misunderstanding...</p>
  <p> Troi's tone is gentle, caring -- she's both<br>
    investigating Kwan's death and counseling a bereaved<br>
    crewmember.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought you might like to know<br>
    that in his personal logs, Dan<br>
    talked about you a great deal. He<br>
    loved you very much.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    If that's true... then how could<br>
    he... leave me like this?</p>
  <p> Troi puts a comforting hand to her shoulder.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's what I'm trying to find<br>
    out. I know it's hard to talk<br>
    about right now... but it would be<br>
    very helpful if you could tell me<br>
    a few things about him.</p>
  <p> Calloway acknowledges, pulls herself together.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When was the last time you saw<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Two nights ago... we were planning<br>
    our next shore leave together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did he mention anything that<br>
    happened recently... anything that<br>
    might have upset him?</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    No, not really... he did say<br>
    something about work, about<br>
    Lieutenant Nara, but it wasn't<br>
    anything serious.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nara... she's his superior officer<br>
    in the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Yes. Dan sensed that she... well,<br>
    that she felt threatened by him --<br>
    that she thought he was after her<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Troi take this in.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Was he prone to mood swings, or<br>
    depression?</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    No... but he was very sensitive to<br>
    other people's moods.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Sometimes he would just... look at<br>
    me, and know what I was feeling --<br>
    I always loved that about him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Napeans are partially empathic --<br>
    he may have inherited some of his<br>
    mother's abilities.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    He used to tease me that when I<br>
    met her, I wouldn't be able to get<br>
    away with anything.</p>
  <p> Calloway is thoughtful for a moment.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Dan and I knew each other for over<br>
    two years, but we didn't really<br>
    get together until a few months<br>
    ago. We took it slow...</p>
  <p> Her face falters a little....</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We thought we had all the time in<br>
    the world...</p>
  <p> Troi is struck by the depth of feeling in her words.<br>
    Calloway turns to her, suddenly determined.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Something must've happened to him,<br>
    Counselor. Something terrible<br>
    Because it's not like Dan to take<br>
    his own life. Please... find out<br>
    what it was.</p>
  <p> Troi takes Calloway's plea to heart. Off her face,<br>
    more determined than ever...</p>
  <p>20 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> as Troi climbs the ladder toward the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p>21 INT. NACELLE CONTROL</p>
  <p> as she ENTERS from a Jefferies tube junction. No one<br>
    is there, and the room is bathed by an eerie GLOW that<br>
    emanates from the maintenance DOOR (which is DOWN, in<br>
    position).</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi takes a look around the room, starts her way down<br>
    its length. It is clear from her face that she finds<br>
    the whole setting a little spooky -- the strange light,<br>
    the dissonant HUM of the plasma stream, the fact that<br>
    a man died here...</p>
  <p> She continues her slow walk down the length of the<br>
    room... as she passes a FREE-STANDING CONSOLE, a FIGURE<br>
    suddenly emerges from behind it. Troi is startled,<br>
    steps back...</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    I'm sorry --</p>
  <p> Troi recovers --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't see you there...</p>
  <p> They share a smile over this little incident.<br>
    Lieutenant Nara is holding a TOOL she was working on<br>
    the console with.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're Lieutenant Nara, aren't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> Nara acknowledges.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    Can I do something for you,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm investigating Lieutenant<br>
    Kwan's death. I just wanted to<br>
    take a look around.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    It's such a shame. He was a good<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> Troi senses Nara is sincere about this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you notice any change in his<br>
    behavior recently?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    No... I've been going over the<br>
    last few days in my mind, trying<br>
    to see if I missed any... warning<br>
    signs. It's as if something in<br>
    him just... snapped.</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How was his job performance?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    Excellent. He knew this ship<br>
    better than most people --<br>
    probably because he helped build<br>
    it back at Utopia Planitia.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did he get along with his coworkers?</p>
  <p> Nara considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    He was... ambitious. He came in<br>
    here with all sorts of new ideas<br>
    about how to do things -- some of<br>
    them very good ideas.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But not all?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    No. But once he settled in, we<br>
    got along fine.</p>
  <p> An N.D. ENTERS and Nara gestures that she'll be right<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Excuse me for a minute. Feel free<br>
    to look around.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where was Lieutenant Kwan's<br>
    station?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    Right down there.</p>
  <p> Nara indicates a console at the far end of the room.<br>
    Troi acknowledges and Nara crosses away, EXITS with the<br>
    N.D. Troi starts her way down toward Kwan's station.</p>
  <p> With each step she takes, we get a sense that she's<br>
    starting to feel more and more spooked about being<br>
    alone in the room again. We see her try to shake the<br>
    feeling, cross her arms in front of her, and continue.</p>
  <p> She moves to Kwan's station, not really expecting to<br>
    find anything, just trying to get a feel for what<br>
    Kwan's work was like. She turns away, starts to climb<br>
    the ladder to the catwalk.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>22 ON TROI</p>
  <p> as she moves toward the maintenance door, her face<br>
    growing increasingly brighter.</p>
  <p> Suddenly we see an expression of fear cross her<br>
    features. Troi is overwhelmed by a sense of panic and<br>
    dread, so visceral and immediate that it almost makes<br>
    her gasp.</p>
  <p> She backs away, but the feeling persists, and she<br>
    stumbles back, disoriented by whatever strange<br>
    sensation has overwhelmed her.</p>
  <p> Her hand flies to her mouth to stifle a cry of fear<br>
    that seems to reach from her very core...</p>
  <p> Suddenly Nara ENTERS --</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> Seeing Troi's condition, Nara rushes toward her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (shaken)<br>
    I... don't know...</p>
  <p> Off Troi's troubled expression...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>23 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi is sitting on the center bio-bed, still shaken.<br>
    BEVERLY is doing a TRICORDER scan. Riker and Worf<br>
    stand nearby.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know how to describe it...<br>
    I was suddenly overwhelmed by a<br>
    flood of emotions -- fear, rage,<br>
    panic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Whose emotions? I thought you<br>
    said you were alone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was. The sensations didn't seem<br>
    to be coming from any one person --<br>
    they were just there, in the room.</p>
  <p> But how can that be?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I scanned the area -- I picked up<br>
    no anomalous readings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    How could you be getting an<br>
    empathic impression from an empty<br>
    room?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> Everyone considers this inexplicable phenomenon for a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Could the fact that Kwan was<br>
    partially empathic have something<br>
    to do with it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not sure... but the feelings<br>
    Troi described certainly seem<br>
    consistent with suicide.</p>

  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Could his death have left some<br>
    sort of... empathic echo?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I suppose it's a possibility...<br>
    but I don't see how.</p>
  <p> There just isn't enough information for them to go on.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continued)<br>
    If I went back to the nacelle<br>
    tube, I might be able to get a<br>
    better sense of what I<br>
    experienced.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm not sure that's a good idea --<br>
    you're showing elevated levels of<br>
    psilosynine.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Psilosynine?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A neuro-transmitter involved in<br>
    telepathy.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    The experience overwhelmed you the<br>
    first time. I don't think you<br>
    should go back until the levels<br>
    return to normal.</p>
  <p> Troi indicates her agreement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Three, maybe four hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Next time I want someone with you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will accompany you, Counselor.</p>

    will depart for Barson Two.</p>
  <p>25 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi is working at her DESKTOP COMPUTER TERMINAL, going<br>
    over Kwan's personal logs.</p>
  <p> KWAN'S VOICE<br>
    -- I ran into Maddy yesterday. We<br>
    stood in the corridor and talked<br>
    for almost an hour... The more I<br>
    get to know her, the more I<br>
    realize what a remarkable woman<br>
    she is...</p>
  <p> Troi smiles a little wistfully at this... the door<br>
    CHIMES.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to reveal Worf standing in the doorway.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Hello, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS and crosses toward her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Have you found anything in<br>
    Lieutenant Kwan's logs?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Everything I've seen indicates he<br>
    was well-adjusted and optimistic.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Were you able to talk with Ensign<br>
    Trake?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I interviewed all of Kwan's<br>
    co-workers.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    From what I've read, Trake was his<br>
    best friend.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He observed nothing that indicated<br>
    Kwan was contemplating ending his<br>
    life. Nor did any of the others.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It just doesn't make any sense...</p>

  <p> Troi stands, crosses toward the replicator.</p>

    Can I get you anything?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, thank you.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yridian tea...</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND of the Replicator and Troi removes a<br>
    cup from the slot. They settle into a couch and a<br>
    nearby chair.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continued)<br>
    I've been thinking about what<br>
    happened to me in the nacelle<br>
    tube... whether it was an empathic<br>
    echo left by Kwan's death...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    In the past, have your empathic<br>
    experiences always involved the<br>
    physical presence of another<br>
    person?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All the ones I'm sure of, yes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What do you mean, sure of?</p>
  <p> Troi considers a beat before replying...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... when I was a young girl,<br>
    my Grandfather used to tell me<br>
    stories by the fire... I would<br>
    close my eyes and listen to his<br>
    mind for hours on end...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He told you these stories<br>
    telepathically... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My grandfather rarely spoke out<br>
    loud... He said that was for off-worlders<br>
    who didn't know any<br>
    better.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    The only time I can remember his<br>
    stories is when I go home... and<br>
    sit by the fireplace. Sometimes<br>
    when I'm there, alone... it's<br>
    almost as if I can hear his voice<br>
    in my head.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts without skepticism.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I have sought visions in<br>
    fire.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can't explain it, but it felt<br>
    very real to me. Just like what<br>
    happened in the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There are things we do not<br>
    understand, yet they exist<br>
    nonetheless.</p>
  <p> Troi sips her tea, is thoughtful for a moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I keep thinking about Ensign<br>
    Calloway... she needs to know<br>
    what happened to Kwan -- it's the<br>
    only way she'll ever be able to<br>
    put his death behind her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This must be a very difficult time<br>
    for her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you know what she regrets most?<br>
    That she and Kwan didn't take full<br>
    advantage of the time they had<br>
    together... they knew each other<br>
    for a long time, but they didn't<br>
    get together until recently.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    She wishes they had acted on their<br>
    feelings sooner... ?</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges -- their eyes meet for a moment, then<br>
    Worf looks away.</p>

  <p>26 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> where Worf is standing alone at the bar, pensive.<br>
    Behind him, we see Riker at a table with an attractive<br>
    young WOMAN. After a moment he stands and approaches<br>
    the bar to get a couple beverages.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Lieutenant Corell seems to be<br>
    enjoying your company.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'd like to think so.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you... involved with her?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure yet.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Worf -- it's not like him to ask these<br>
    sorts of questions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Why do you ask? Are you<br>
    interested in her?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Then Worf hastens to point out --</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But if I were, I would of course<br>
    discuss the situation with you<br>
    before proceeding further.</p>
  <p> Riker understands that this is Worf's way, but --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I appreciate the thought, but you<br>
    really wouldn't have to do that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would never want to come between<br>
    you and anyone you were involved<br>
    with... or had ever been involved<br>
    with.</p>
  <p> Riker senses there's more going on than Worf's saying.<br>
    The bartender arrives and sets down the drinks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there... someone in particular<br>
    you're talking about?</p>
  <p> Worf can't quite bring himself to say.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. Is there... someone in<br>
    particular you would prefer I not<br>
    become involved with?</p>
  <p> Riker has to stifle a smile over Worf's awkwardness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf... you sound like a man<br>
    asking a friend if he can start<br>
    dating his sister.</p>
  <p> Worf dissembles --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, I am merely... never mind.<br>
    Excuse me, sir.</p>
  <p> And with that he turns and EXITS Ten Forward. Riker is<br>
    left to wonder what had him so twisted up...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>28 INT. NACELLE CONTROL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Worf and Troi ENTER from the Jefferies tube. The<br>
    room is bathed by the eerie light that comes through<br>
    the window in the maintenance door.</p>
  <p> Worf glances at Troi to see if she's all right; she<br>
    takes a breath to steel herself, then starts to look<br>
    around the room.</p>
  <p> She climbs the ladder to the catwalk and approaches the<br>
    maintenance door -- her face is lit by the glow from<br>
    the plasma stream.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Could you open this door for me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, but only for a short time.<br>
    After ninety seconds the plasma<br>
    venting system will engage to<br>
    prevent degradation of the<br>
    forcefield.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I just want to take a quick<br>
    look...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    May I ask what you are looking<br>
    for?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm... not sure...</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges, moves back toward the entrance and<br>
    starts to work a console...</p>
  <p> A motor HUMS to life and the heavy door starts to OPEN --<br>
    revealing the PLASMA STREAM.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Warning -- plasma venting system<br>
    will engage in ninety seconds.</p>
  <p> Worf stands at the console, ready to close it again<br>
    when Troi requests it.</p>
  <p>29 ON TROI</p>
  <p> as she looks into the plasma stream, her face lit by<br>
    its glow. Suddenly we hear a jarring, percussive<br>
    SOUND. Troi reacts and we --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>30 TROI'S POV - HANDHELD</p>
  <p> a WOMAN is standing a few yards away from her, looking<br>
    directly at Troi, terrified. She's wearing an<br>
    Engineering jumpsuit, and appears to be in her<br>
    thirties.</p>
  <p> Though we don't see Troi, the POV would indicate that<br>
    she's standing in another part of the control room --<br>
    not the catwalk where we just saw her. Stranger still,<br>
    the room around her appears to be unfinished, as if it<br>
    were still under construction. The plasma stream is<br>
    not on.</p>
  <p> The woman backs away from Troi, shaking her head in<br>
    terror --</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    No... please... don't...</p>
  <p> Before Troi can ask who she is we hear the jarring<br>
    SOUND again and --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>31 TROI</p>
  <p> as her head snaps back. She looks around the room,<br>
    which is back to normal -- she's disoriented by the<br>
    bizarre image that suddenly appeared in her mind.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Plasma venting system will engage<br>
    in... eighty seconds.</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND again and Troi's head snaps back --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>32 TROI'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a MAN is staring at her -- intent, menacing. His face<br>
    is a little hazy, as if we're looking at him through a<br>
    tinted glass. He too is in his thirties, and wears an<br>
    Engineering jumpsuit. From what little Troi can see,<br>
    he also appears to be in the unfinished control room.</p>
  <p> The SOUND again --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/21/93 - ACT TWO 28.</p>
  <p>33 TROI</p>
  <p> reeling back from the jarring image. She looks around,<br>
    disoriented, and is stunned to see that the room around<br>
    her has changed.</p>
  <p> She's in the partially constructed control room she<br>
    caught glimpses of before -- consoles are open, their<br>
    circuitry exposed. The free-standing console is gone,<br>
    and tubes jut from the floor in its place. The<br>
    maintenance door is up, but the plasma stream is not<br>
    on. A TOOLBOX sits on the floor, with a label in large<br>
    lettering that reads UTOPIA PLANITIA.</p>
  <p>33A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Troi looks down toward the injector and sees that a<br>
    panel in the injector room wall is off, exposing a<br>
    power conduit underneath.</p>
  <p> Confused, she turns and looks toward where Worf was<br>
    standing -- he's gone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... ?</p>
  <p> No answer. She's alone... Off this moment we...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>34 INT. NACELLE CONTROL - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, where are you?</p>
  <p> Still no answer. Troi looks around the room, tries not<br>
    to panic.</p>
  <p> She hears the SOUND of two hushed voices whispering --<br>
    a man and a woman's. Troi moves toward the sound...<br>
    it's coming from the Jefferies tube junction.</p>
  <p> She descends the ladder, moves toward the junction.</p>
  <p>35 TROI'S POV - HANDHELD</p>
  <p> as the junction comes into her view -- she sees a man<br>
    and woman locked in a passionate and furtive embrace.</p>
  <p> They're startled by her appearance, and look at her as<br>
    if caught. Troi recognizes the woman -- the same<br>
    terrified face she saw before.</p>
  <p> They regard Troi for a beat, then suddenly the man<br>
    stifles a laugh. The woman buries her face in his<br>
    chest to stifle her own laugh -- it is the kind of<br>
    laughter that can overcome you at an inappropriate<br>
    place, like church, or a funeral. It's bizarre,<br>
    disturbing -- they're laughing at Troi.</p>
  <p>36 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Troi backs away, and is startled when she bumps into a<br>
    large figure. She turns, not knowing what to expect --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>37 WORF</p>
  <p> holding Troi by the shoulders, trying to shake her<br>
    awake. The control room around them is back to normal.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Counselor... are you all right --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - THREE 30.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> It takes Troi a moment to realize her hallucinatory<br>
    experience is over. She's disoriented, shaken...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Get me out of here...</p>
  <p> Off her troubled expression...</p>
  <p>38 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> where Picard, Beverly and Data are conferring with Troi<br>
    and Worf about what happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you remember anything else?</p>
  <p> Troi thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I saw a tool crate on the floor...<br>
    it was labeled Utopia Planitia.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The shipyard where the Enterprise<br>
    was built.</p>
  <p> Everyone takes this in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Clearly this was much more than an<br>
    empathic echo. It seems that you<br>
    were actually seeing something<br>
    that happened in the control room<br>
    eight years ago.</p>
  <p> Troi struggles to make sense of her experience.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Everyone was looking directly at<br>
    me. It's almost as if... I were<br>
    seeing through someone else's<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> Everyone considers this bizarre notion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant Kwan was partially<br>
    empathic...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/21/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe you were seeing through his<br>
    eyes?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's a possibility... but I don't<br>
    understand how it could have<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> No one has an explanation for this mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's put that question aside for<br>
    a moment and assume that by some<br>
    unexplained phenomenon, you<br>
    witnessed an event that may have<br>
    involved Lieutenant Kwan.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    The faces you saw -- did you<br>
    recognize them?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't think I've ever seen the<br>
    woman before, or the man who was<br>
    with her. But there was someone<br>
    else there. A man... he was<br>
    staring at me in the most peculiar<br>
    way. I think he had... reddish<br>
    hair. He seemed familiar to me...<br>
    but it's all so hazy, like trying<br>
    to remember a dream.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The woman seemed terrified of<br>
    something... then you saw her<br>
    again, laughing -- presumably at<br>
    Lieutenant Kwan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What could it all mean?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know. But something<br>
    terrible happened in that room.<br>
    I felt it.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges the possibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor... I want you to look<br>
    over the personnel files from<br>
    Utopia Planitia and see if you can<br>
    identify the faces you saw.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If only there were some way I<br>
    could go back to the control room<br>
    and not be overwhelmed by the<br>
    experience -- it might help me<br>
    remember some detail that could be<br>
    relevant.</p>
  <p> Beverly considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I could give you an inhibitor that<br>
    would slow your brain's production<br>
    of psilosynine. That would<br>
    probably suppress your empathic<br>
    abilities enough to make the<br>
    experience manageable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd like to try.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, Counselor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It'll take about sixteen hours to<br>
    synthesize the inhibitor.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and the meeting breaks up.</p>
  <p>39 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi is working at an aft science station, looking<br>
    through pictures of Starfleet personnel. She's clearly<br>
    been at it for some time now. Data has the bridge, and<br>
    N.D.s man the various stations.</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS from the Turbolift and she glances up at<br>
    him when he approaches.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I apologize for being late. The<br>
    viral medicines we are<br>
    transporting to Barson Two require<br>
    special security measures to<br>
    insure they are properly<br>
    contained.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Have you found anything?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... there were literally<br>
    thousands of people involved in<br>
    building the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps if you found a way to<br>
    narrow the search parameters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think I have. The man who<br>
    seemed familiar to me may have<br>
    been on board the Enterprise<br>
    during the last seven years. I've<br>
    asked the computer to limit its<br>
    search to personnel who've served<br>
    at Utopia Planitia and on the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges and they turn their attention to the<br>
    console. Troi works the panel and responds to the FACE<br>
    that she sees on it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ensign Salvatore... he transferred<br>
    off the Enterprise last year.</p>
  <p> She works the control again and sees another face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant Ziff... she's in<br>
    quantum mechanics.</p>
  <p> She works the controls and reacts to the next face that<br>
    APPEARS on the monitor -- it's the man she saw staring<br>
    at her, LIEUTENANT WALTER PIERCE.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off monitor)<br>
    Lieutenant Walter Pierce...</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I remember now... he came aboard<br>
    about six months ago. I think<br>
    he's in Engineering.</p>
  <p> They glance at each other, and start for the Turbolift.</p>

  <p>42 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> where Troi and Worf are talking with PIERCE. He's<br>
    human, in his mid-thirties, with reddish hair and<br>
    piercing eyes. He wears a gold Engineering uniform.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were Lieutenant Kwan's<br>
    supervisor at Utopia Planitia.</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    That's right. I was sorry to hear<br>
    what happened...</p>
  <p> Pierce seems sincere about this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you spend time in the nacelle<br>
    control room while it was under<br>
    construction?</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    I worked all over the ship. In<br>
    fact, I remember running a power<br>
    conduit right behind that wall<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> He gestures to a wall and smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Were you ever in the nacelle room<br>
    at the same time as Lieutenant<br>
    Kwan?</p>
  <p> This strikes Pierce as a slightly odd question; he<br>
    considers a beat before answering.</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    It was a long time ago... people<br>
    were working all over the place.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So you do not remember?</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    I'm sorry, I don't.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/22/93 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi studies his face for a beat, as if gauging whether<br>
    or not he's telling the truth.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you recall if anything...<br>
    unusual happened there?</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    How do you mean?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    An altercation, perhaps. Possibly<br>
    involving Lieutenant Kwan.</p>
  <p> Troi watches his face carefully as he replies.</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    No... nothing like that. The way<br>
    I remember it, things went pretty<br>
    smoothly.</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi take this in.</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's this all about? If you<br>
    don't mind my asking.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not at all. You see, when I went<br>
    into the nacelle room, I had an...<br>
    empathic experience.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We believe she may have been<br>
    seeing some event that occurred<br>
    there eight years ago.</p>
  <p> Pierce can't quite hide the fact that this all sounds<br>
    a little improbable to him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And -- I saw you there.</p>
  <p> Troi watches his face for a reaction -- but he doesn't<br>
    give anything away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do you have any idea why that<br>
    might be?</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    I'm afraid I don't.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Lieutenant... you're probably<br>
    aware that I can sense whether<br>
    someone's telling the truth.</p>
  <p> What she's implying is clear to Pierce.</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    I've heard that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure, then, that if you were<br>
    to... remember anything that might<br>
    be relevant to our investigation,<br>
    you'd contact me.</p>

    Well... it wouldn't be much of a<br>
    bluff if you knew, would it?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts as he considers the possibility that she's<br>

    her mind is working to sort everything out...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Breakfast is ready...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mmm... that sounds good...</p>
  <p> He starts to stand but she grabs hold of him, pulls him<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it can wait...</p>
  <p> They nestle into each other's arms... both are clearly<br>
    feeling very comfortable with each other and with what<br>
    happened... She studies his face for a beat, smiles --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Why didn't we do this a long time<br>
    ago... ?</p>
  <p> Suddenly the COM SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Crusher to Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> Troi reaches and activates the COMPANEL next to her<br>
    bed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I've synthesized the inhibitor;<br>
    you can come to Sickbay whenever<br>
    you're ready.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> They nestle into each other's arms again. Suddenly<br>
    Worf's combadge SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Crusher to Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi exchange a look -- she couldn't possibly<br>
    know they're together. He activates his combadge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Worf, here.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    The medical supplies are ready to<br>
    be taken to the cargo bay for<br>
    transport.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will be there shortly.</p>
  <p> Troi and Worf look at each other -- time to get to<br>
    work. Off this moment...</p>
  <p>46 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> where Beverly is giving Troi a HYPO-SPRAY. A few N.D.s<br>
    are working in the corner, assembling the MEDKITS for<br>
    Barson Two.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There... you should start feeling<br>
    the effect immediately.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How completely will it suppress my<br>
    empathic abilities?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's hard to say for sure... I can<br>
    raise the dosage if you find it's<br>
    not enough.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges, hops off the bio-bed. Worf and<br>
    Calloway ENTER in mid-conversation from another part of<br>
    Sickbay -- both are carrying PADDS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    -- the cargo bay will be off-limits<br>
    to all but medical<br>
    personnel.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Thanks for your help, sir.</p>
  <p> She smiles, crosses toward the N.D.s working on the<br>
    Medkits. Worf approaches Beverly and Troi. She smiles<br>
    as if greeting him for the first time that day.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Good morning.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> An N.D. pulls Beverly away to look something over.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data and Geordi are already in the<br>
    nacelle room. Are you ready?</p>
  <p> Worf is about to answer when Calloway turns to him.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Excuse me, sir. About the<br>
    quarantine field in the cargo<br>
    bay...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    It looks like we're going to need<br>
    a second field generator.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I am needed here. I will join you<br>
    as soon as I can.</p>
  <p> Troi would like to have him with her, but understands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All right...</p>
  <p> They part ways and she crosses toward the door. She<br>
    glances back before leaving and sees Worf approaching<br>
    Calloway... the young Ensign smiles and hands him a<br>
    PADD to look over... Off Troi's face as she EXITS...</p>
  <p>47 INT. NACELLE CONTROL</p>
  <p> as Troi ENTERS. The plasma stream is disengaged and<br>
    the maintenance door is open. Data is on the main<br>
    level, scanning with a TRICORDER. Geordi is up on the<br>
    catwalk, scanning a bulkhead with a SPECIAL DEVICE.<br>
    NARA is manning a console.</p>
  <p> Troi stops when she comes in, takes a moment to gauge<br>
    her feelings. Geordi glances toward her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Counselor, you okay?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm fine. The inhibitor seems to<br>
    be working.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Have you found anything?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing unusual.</p>
  <p> Troi starts looking around, to see if anything jogs her<br>
    memory. She stops at a certain console.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't remember seeing this<br>
    console during my empathic<br>
    experience. Has it been here<br>
    since the ship was built?</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data exchange a look --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, we installed it about two<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> The fact that she's right about this boosts her<br>
    confidence. She climbs the ladder to the catwalk,<br>
    joins Geordi near the OPENING that looks out into the<br>
    nacelle tube.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>48 GEORDI AND TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> we can see the injector room behind them, with the<br>
    plasma injector jutting up from the floor, and beyond<br>
    it, the nacelle tube itself -- running tunnel-like into<br>
    the distance.</p>
  <p> Troi looks down toward the injector, remembers<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I remember seeing some sort of<br>
    power conduit...</p>
  <p>48A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> looking down into the injector room. She gestures to<br>
    a point on the wall.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Right there.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The main ODN line runs right<br>
    behind that panel... it lifts out<br>
    so you can get to it.</p>
  <p> Nara realizes something...</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    Kwan was working on that conduit<br>
    the day before he died.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Can you open it?</p>
  <p> Geordi isn't sure why she wants to do this, but<br>
    immediately agrees.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure... it'll just take a minute.</p>
  <p> Geordi climbs down the ladder and joins Data -- they<br>
    EXIT through an access door on the main level that<br>
    leads into the nacelle tube.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 44A.</p>
  <p>50 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Troi watches from above as the they enter the injector<br>
    room and cross past the injector, heading for the point<br>
    on the wall she indicated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/21/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>51 TROI</p>
  <p> as she climbs down the ladder and moves toward<br>
    Lieutenant Nara.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Lieutenant... the work Lieutenant<br>
    Kwan was doing, was it unusual in<br>
    any way?</p>
  <p> NARA<br>
    He was refitting a field coil.<br>
    But it was probably the first time<br>
    that particular panel's been<br>
    opened since the ship was built.</p>
  <p> Troi takes this in. She heads for the access door...</p>
  <p>52 INT. INJECTOR ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Troi ENTERS. She looks over to see Data and Geordi<br>
    lifting off the wall panel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's set it down right here...</p>
  <p>53 TROI</p>
  <p> as we hear the same distinctive JARRING SOUND and her<br>
    head snaps back slightly --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>54 TROI'S POV -- HANDHELD</p>
  <p> the face of the terrified woman flashes before her eyes --<br>
    again, Troi's POV indicates that she is standing in the<br>
    control room while it is under construction.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>55 TROI</p>
  <p> as she snaps out of it -- disoriented...</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    (off camera)<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> The SOUND again and we --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>56 TROI'S POV - HANDHELD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Lieutenant Pierce's face -- staring at her, menacing --</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>57 SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Troi snaps out of her hallucination; Geordi is<br>
    rushing toward her --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Something happened... when you<br>
    took off the panel...</p>
  <p> She steadies herself, moves toward the exposed conduit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There must be something there...</p>
  <p> They cross toward Data, who takes out his tricorder and<br>
    begins to scan.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am picking up readings that<br>
    indicate there is organic material<br>
    imbedded in the wall...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Organic material?</p>
  <p> Geordi scans with the special device.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're right... let me reconfigure<br>
    the emitter beam. We might be<br>
    able to see what it is...</p>
  <p> Geordi works for a beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There...</p>
  <p> He raises the device toward the wall. A BEAM emanates<br>
    from the machine, bathing a section of the wall --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>58 INSERT -- THE WALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where in an almost X-RAY LIKE EFFECT, we can see that<br>
    there are bone fragments embedded in the wall behind<br>
    the conduit. They are parts of a human skeleton -- a<br>
    forearm and hand... part of a skull... a few ribs,<br>
    connected to the sternum.</p>
  <p> Off their shocked reactions...</p>
  <p>59 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where Beverly is giving Troi another suppression HYPO.<br>
    Worf stands nearby.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This dosage should prevent any<br>
    further empathic flashes.</p>
  <p> Ensign Calloway ENTERS carrying a shallow CONTAINER in<br>
    which the bone fragments have been placed.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    The bone fragments are definitely<br>
    human... I sequenced a DNA sample;<br>
    I'll see if I can match it to<br>
    Starfleet records.</p>
  <p> She and Worf move away to work at a nearby console.<br>
    Beverly scans the fragments with a TRICORDER.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    I'd say these fragments had been<br>
    in the wall about seven or eight<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges, but seems to be paying more<br>
    attention to Worf and Calloway -- they're sitting side<br>
    by side at a console, their shoulders nearly touching<br>
    as they work the controls.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You said something happened when<br>
    the panel was opened...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Troi is only half-listening -- she's watching Worf and<br>
    Calloway.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I wonder if the fragments<br>
    themselves could've somehow<br>
    triggered your experience. I'll<br>
    run a resonance scan, see if<br>
    anything turns up.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Sir, I think we've found a<br>
    match...</p>
  <p> Troi and Beverly cross to the console where they're<br>
    working. There's a wall-panel above it, in which it's<br>
    possible to see someone's vague outline reflected.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Apparently the remains are those<br>
    of an Ensign Marla Finn --</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    I'm trying to find a picture of<br>
    her in the records...</p>
  <p> She works the controls -- after a beat, some text<br>
    APPEARS on the MONITOR, and next to it, Finn's FACE --<br>
    it is the same terrified woman Troi saw in her empathic<br>
    flashback, the woman she also saw in the Jefferies<br>
    tube, with the man...</p>
  <p> Troi recognizes her immediately --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's her. That's the woman I<br>
    saw.</p>
  <p> Reactions. Beverly leans in to study the biographical<br>
    information displayed on the screen.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She was reported missing from<br>
    Utopia Planitia on Stardate<br>
    40987.2. Eight years ago...</p>
  <p> Reactions.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How could her body have ended up<br>
    embedded inside a bulkhead... ?</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    Maybe there was some kind of...<br>
    accident.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Or she was killed. And the<br>
    murderer hid her remains.</p>
  <p> Troi's mind is working, trying to put it all together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Something's not right... pull up<br>
    Lieutenant Kwan's service record.</p>
  <p> Worf works the controls and Troi leans in to look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I thought so... he didn't arrive<br>
    at the shipyard until six months<br>
    after Finn's death.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I couldn't have been seeing<br>
    through his eyes...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then whose... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It had to have been someone who<br>
    was at least partially telepathic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Pierce... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But you saw him there.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, but not as clearly as I saw<br>
    everything else... his face<br>
    looked...</p>
  <p> Troi realizes --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Like that.</p>
  <p> She points to her reflection in the wall panel.<br>
    Reactions.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A reflection...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    I was seeing through his eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 49A.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to this --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And Finn was trying to get away<br>
    from him; she was afraid of him...</p>
  <p> That's enough for Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I think it is time we had<br>
    another... conversation with<br>
    Lieutenant Pierce.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges and they start toward the door. When<br>
    they reach it Worf stops and turns back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>

    Ensign Calloway...</p>
  <p> She turns at the sound of his voice.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you for your help.</p>
  <p> She smiles an acknowledgment and Worf and Troi EXIT.</p>
  <p>60 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they ENTER from Sickbay and start down it. Troi<br>
    glances at Worf as they approach the Turbolift --<br>
    something's on her mind.</p>
  <p> The lift OPENS and several N.D.s get off.</p>
  <p>61 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deck ten.</p>
  <p> as they ENTER the empty lift. After a silent moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... I want to ask you<br>
    something...</p>
  <p> He turns to her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do you regret what happened last<br>
    night?</p>
  <p> This hits Worf from out of nowhere.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... of course not.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you sure? Because I don't<br>
    want anything to jeopardize our<br>
    friendship.</p>
  <p> He takes her by the shoulders, comforts her --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deanna... I do not regret being<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/22/93 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>

  <p> She looks up at him, relieved by the sincerity of his<br>
    reply.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> Her tone becomes softer, as if she's needs reassurance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I just... don't feel myself.<br>
    Maybe it's the inhibitor -- I'm so<br>
    used to sensing what people are<br>
    feeling... now I can't.</p>
  <p> He holds her for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps I should talk to<br>
    Lieutenant Pierce alone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That might be a good idea...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will meet you in your quarters.</p>
  <p> She looks up at him, smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll be waiting for you...</p>
  <p> The lift stops and the doors OPEN. Worf gives her a<br>
    final reassuring look, then EXITS. When the door shuts<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Calloway turns her face away to stifle a laugh, buries<br>
    her face in Worf's chest. A smile forms on Worf's<br>
    face, and it builds into a laugh... they're laughing at<br>
    her -- it's eerily reminiscent of the couple Troi saw<br>
    in the nacelle tube, and just as unsettling.</p>
  <p> Troi can't stand it, they're mocking her, laughing at<br>
    her --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Stop it --</p>
  <p> But they don't hear and don't care. She sees Worf's<br>
    PHASER on a nearby chair (on which his metal chest sash<br>
    is draped), and grabs it --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Stop it --</p>
  <p> As she raises the weapon to fire, Worf reacts, moves to<br>
    stand in front of Ensign Calloway -- the BEAM hits him<br>
    full in the chest, sending him careening back onto the<br>
    floor.</p>
  <p> When Troi sees what she's done she drops the phaser in<br>
    horror... Calloway rushes to Worf, who is slumped<br>
    against the wall with a nasty burn mark on his chest.</p>
  <p> CALLOWAY<br>
    (aghast)<br>
    He's dead... you killed him...</p>
  <p> Troi backs away, shakes her head as if she can't<br>
    believe what she's done...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... no...</p>
  <p> The door OPENS as Troi backs toward it... she turns<br>
    away from the horrible sight, wracked with emotion she<br>
    rushes from the room.</p>
  <p>66 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Troi ENTERS from Calloway's quarters. She runs down<br>
    it -- she wants to get away, she has to get away from<br>
    here --</p>
  <p> She rounds a corner and almost runs into Pierce and the<br>
    two Guards. She steps back, looks at him --</p>
  <p> PIERCE<br>
    You know what you have to do...</p>
  <p> His voice is gentle, sympathetic -- but Troi turns away<br>
    from him, moves off --</p>
  <p>67 INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Troi pushes her way past several startled N.D's and<br>
    comes to a door... it OPENS and admits her to --</p>
  <p>68 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> a room similar to the one right off main Engineering --<br>
    she starts up the ladder.</p>
  <p>69 INT. NACELLE CONTROL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Troi ENTERS. The room is deserted, dark -- lit only<br>
    by the glow of the plasma stream through the<br>
    maintenance door.</p>
  <p> She looks up at it, as if drawn to its eerie glow. She<br>
    climbs the ladder to the catwalk... approaches the<br>
    window in the maintenance door...</p>
  <p> Suddenly a motor HUMS to life and the maintenance door<br>
    starts to OPEN, seemingly of its own accord, exposing<br>
    the PLASMA STREAM in the tube.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/20/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>70 TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she stares at the coursing stream... she seems<br>
    calmed by it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    I know... what I have to do...</p>
  <p> She steps toward it... stares into the plasma for a<br>
    moment, preparing to jump.</p>
  <p> Suddenly a HAND reaches into frame and grabs her by the<br>
    shoulder --</p>
  <p>71 NEW ANGLE -- THE ROOM</p>
  <p> is suddenly bright again. It's Worf, alive -- in a<br>
    single fluid move he pulls her away from the fiery<br>
    opening. Troi is startled to find herself in his grip.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Plasma venting system will engage<br>
    in... seventy seconds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What were you doing?</p>
  <p> Instead of answering, she reaches forward and touches<br>
    his chest, where his sash is now in place -- a wave of<br>
    relief washes over her when she realizes there's no<br>
    phaser burn there.</p>
  <p> Troi is back in the uniform she was wearing in act two,<br>
    when she and Worf came to the nacelle tube together.<br>
    We have returned to the same point in time. Everything<br>
    that has happened since Worf opened the maintenance<br>
    door has been in Troi's mind.</p>
  <p> All that's happened from Worf's point of view is that<br>
    he opened the door as Troi asked, then turned to find<br>
    her standing too close to the opening.</p>
  <p> Troi looks up at Worf... she doesn't know how or why,<br>
    but all that matters to her now is that he's alive...</p>
  <p> She crushes herself to him...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're alive... you're all<br>
    right...</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't know what to make of this... he holds her,<br>
    safe in his arms... Off this moment...</p>

  <p>72 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves at impulse.</p>
  <p>73 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Worf and Data are discussing what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    -- I opened the maintenance door<br>
    at Counselor Troi's request, then<br>
    turned and saw that she had moved<br>
    too close to the force-field.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It all seemed so real to me. It's<br>
    hard to imagine that everything I<br>
    experienced happened in just those<br>
    few seconds...</p>
  <p> Data indicates the wall MONITOR, on which are displayed<br>
    pictures of Pierce (in an Engineering jumpsuit), the<br>
    murdered woman, and the man Troi saw her with.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears that you were correct,<br>
    Counselor. Lieutenant Pierce was<br>
    partially telepathic -- his<br>
    maternal grandmother was from<br>
    Betazed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What else have you found?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to Starfleet records,<br>
    Pierce and the other two persons<br>
    Counselor Troi identified were<br>
    killed in an accidental plasma<br>
    discharge eight years ago. Their<br>
    bodies were never found.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't believe it was an<br>
    accident. I think that Pierce<br>
    found out that the other two were<br>
    having an affair. He lost<br>
    control... and killed them both.</p>
  <p> Picard and the others react.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Afterwards, he probably activated<br>
    the plasma stream, then threw<br>
    himself into it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The plasma discharge would have<br>
    obliterated any evidence that it<br>
    was murder.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS carrying a PADD. Picard looks up at him<br>
    for a report.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; REV. 12/22/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I scanned behind the panel<br>
    Counselor Troi asked me to look<br>
    at. I didn't find any bone<br>
    fragments... but I did find traces<br>
    of cellular residue. It's showing<br>
    some kind of... empathic<br>
    signature.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts to this information. Troi considers<br>
    for a moment.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It may be that when Lieutenant<br>
    Pierce was struck by the plasma<br>
    stream, the subspace energy<br>
    present there imprinted his<br>
    empathic pattern into the residue.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Kind of like a... psychic<br>
    photograph.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's what triggered my<br>
    hallucination... My mind must<br>
    have taken elements from my own<br>
    life and created a situation that<br>
    in many ways paralleled what<br>
    happened to Pierce.</p>
  <p> Troi turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If you hadn't been there, I would<br>
    have jumped... just like he did...</p>
  <p> Everyone considers how close they came to losing her...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>73A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Data and Worf cross to their posts. Troi heads<br>
    for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> She turns back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> Worf turns toward her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When I pulled you away from the<br>
    plasma stream, you seemed...<br>
    surprised that I was alive.</p>
  <p> Troi would rather not get into the specifics of what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... actually, in my<br>
    hallucination... you were killed.</p>
  <p> Worf takes this in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; 12/20/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>73A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    May I ask by whom?</p>
  <p> Troi holds his look for a beat before replying.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You know what they say, Worf...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Hell hath no fury like a woman<br>
    scorned...</p>
  <p> And with that she turns EXITS to the Turbolift, leaving<br>
    Worf to wonder what she meant... Off his face we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
