  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. A BAR</p>
  <p> It's a rough, wretched watering-hole, just the kind of<br>
    place you'd expect on a frontier world at the edge of<br>
    Federation space. The patrons are a hard and nasty<br>
    bunch -- if you're looking for trouble, this is a good<br>
    place to find it.</p>
  <p>2 TROI</p>
  <p> is at the counter, speaking with the BARTENDER, a<br>
    large, intimidating male alien. Deanna is not in<br>
    uniform and instead is wearing clothes that look<br>
    perfectly normal in this place.</p>
  <p> There's a teasing, insouciant quality to Troi -- the<br>
    bartender is attracted to her and she knows it; she's<br>
    using it.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    Tell me... why is it so important<br>
    that you find this man?</p>
  <p> Troi smiles, hinting at mystery.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We had some business dealings...<br>
    he owes me money.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    (suggestively)<br>
    If we had business dealings, I can<br>
    tell you I wouldn't disappear...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe we should discuss that<br>
    possibility. But first, I have to<br>
    find him... collect the money I'm<br>
    owed...</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    Let me guess... you and your<br>
    friend were smuggling relics from<br>
    the ruins of Nafir...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/27/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (maybe)<br>
    Mmmmmm...</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    A dangerous game.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe I like danger.</p>
  <p> He eyes her for a moment, hoping that's an invitation.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    Then you've come to the right<br>
    place.<br>
    (leans toward her)<br>
    I'll be closing in a few hours.<br>
    Perhaps we can discuss this...<br>
    more privately.</p>
  <p> Troi would rather have a tooth drilled, but she smiles<br>
    sweetly at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If I can't find him, I'll have to<br>
    move on. Are you sure you haven't<br>
    seen him?</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    Human... two meters tall... smooth-headed...<br>
    no, I don't remember<br>
    anyone like that.</p>
  <p> Troi eyes him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're lying...</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    And you're Betazoid... I thought<br>
    so.</p>
  <p> He leans in to her, speaks quietly.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    The people who come here count on<br>
    a certain amount of... anonymity.<br>
    If I started answering questions<br>
    about them... even to a very<br>
    beautiful woman... I wouldn't be<br>
    in business very long.</p>
  <p> He sets another drink in front of her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    As a businesswoman, I'm sure you<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> And he moves off, leaving a frustrated Troi.</p>
  <p>3 RIKER</p>
  <p> is in another part of the room. He is with a group of<br>
    people who are in a raucous, merry mood. He laughs<br>
    heartily with them, presumably at a tale that has just<br>
    been told, claps one of them on the back, and<br>
    withdraws.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Great story... I'll have to<br>
    remember that the next time I'm in<br>
    a knife fight...</p>
  <p> He turns to encounter WORF, and the two move aside and<br>
    talk quietly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Any luck?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I think the one over there knows<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Worf looks casually toward a table in the background,<br>
    and Riker's gaze follows.</p>
  <p>4 YRANAC - THEIR POV</p>
  <p> A sleazy male Yridian sits alone at a table, sipping a<br>
    drink and watching the scene around him furtively.</p>
  <p>5 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He wouldn't admit to having seen<br>
    the Captain... but he said that<br>
    anyone who visited the ruins of<br>
    Nafir would probably come here<br>
    eventually... I suspect he knows<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker moves immediately toward the table; Worf tries to<br>
    tell him something.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (loud whisper)<br>
    Commander -- I told him --</p>
  <p> But Riker is out of earshot. Worf follows him to the<br>
    table where Yranac is sitting. The man looks up a bit<br>
    nervously as they approach and sit with him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My friend here tells me you might<br>
    know about the man we're looking<br>
    for.</p>
  <p> Yranac's eyes dart around the room, as though checking<br>
    to see if he's being observed.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    The only reason I'm talking to<br>
    you... is that I have a sister,<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Worf, puzzled.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (covering for Riker)<br>
    I explained to him... that we are<br>
    looking for the man who<br>
    impregnated your sister.</p>
  <p> There is a brief beat as Riker looks at Worf, stifling<br>
    his response (is that the best story you could come up<br>
    with?); then he turns back to Yranac.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can imagine how much this<br>
    means to me.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Family honor is important... If<br>
    someone had defiled my sister...<br>
    I would do anything... pay<br>
    anything... to find the one<br>
    responsible.</p>
  <p> Yranac's message is clear: he's selling this<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I see. And just how much would<br>
    &quot;anything&quot; be?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    As much as... five bars of goldpress<br>
    latinum.</p>
  <p> But before Riker can respond, a hand snakes around<br>
    Yranac's neck, pulling him up and off the chair.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    I think you've had too much to<br>
    drink. You'd better leave.</p>
  <p> The patrons in the immediate vicinity glance at the<br>
    incident, and move away slightly. They're used to<br>
    these unpleasantries and don't want to get involved.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    On your way, Yranac.</p>
  <p> Suddenly a phaser comes into frame and presses against<br>
    the bartender's head.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S VOICE<br>
    I'm sorry... but I think he wants<br>
    to stay.</p>
  <p> The bartender flickers his eyes toward BEVERLY, who is<br>
    also dressed in local clothes, and who holds the<br>
    phaser. The bartender lets go of Yranac.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Yranac)<br>
    Sit down.</p>
  <p> Yranac does. Beverly keeps the phaser trained on the<br>
    bartender. Riker leans in to Yranac.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This --<br>
    (gestures to Beverly)<br>
    -- is my sister.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She's angry.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She has a vicious temper. I<br>
    wouldn't cross her.</p>
  <p> Troi joins them and positions herself on the other side<br>
    of Yranac.</p>
  <p> BARTENDER<br>
    You talk and you're a dead man,<br>
    Yranac.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Yranac looks from one to the other, assessing. To<br>
    Riker:</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Perhaps there is an element of<br>
    risk here that I did not fully<br>
    appreciate.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And how much more latinum will it<br>
    take to offset that risk?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    This isn't about latinum.<br>
    (spreads his hands)<br>
    As a man with a sister -- a sister<br>
    with a temper -- I can sympathize<br>
    with you. But...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How did you come here? Do you<br>
    have a ship in orbit?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Then take me with you. You can<br>
    drop me anywhere you like.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf exchange a look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. Now talk.</p>
  <p> Yranac takes a breath.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    The man you're looking for was<br>
    here several weeks ago. There was<br>
    a group of aliens sitting at this<br>
    table... he was asking them<br>
    questions.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Who were these aliens?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    I don't know. But they looked<br>
    dangerous.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They attacked him. He managed to<br>
    incapacitate three of them before<br>
    he was knocked down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> He points to the wall behind him.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    He was thrown against that wall...<br>
    and fell there.</p>
  <p> Yranac points to a spot on the floor near the wall.<br>
    Beverly hands the phaser to Troi, who keeps it trained<br>
    on the bartender. She pulls out a tricorder and scans<br>
    the wall and floor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm picking up some Starfleet<br>
    fiber traces... and human cellular<br>
    debris.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you establish a DNA sequence?</p>
  <p> Beverly taps a few commands into her tricorder; she<br>
    looks puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's something strange here.<br>
    The cell structures are badly<br>
    distorted. It looks as if they've<br>
    been exposed to some kind of high<br>
    energy field.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A weapon discharge?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It could be. There are faint<br>
    traces of micro-crystalline damage<br>
    in the floor material. But I'm<br>
    not familiar with the pattern.</p>
  <p> Yranac stares at her. He's realizing this group is<br>
    other than what they seem.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Who are you people?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You didn't say anything about a<br>
    weapon.</p>
  <p> Yranac is beginning to look a little nervous.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    I hadn't finished yet. You'll<br>
    like this... the man got what was<br>
    coming to him. When they knocked<br>
    him down, one of them took out a<br>
    weapon... and fired.<br>
    (hoping this is wellreceived)<br>
    He was vaporized.</p>
  <p> There's a moment of stunned silence. Yranac looks from<br>
    one to the other, anxiously awaiting their reaction.<br>
    Troi is staring intently at him. Then she turns to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's telling the truth.</p>
  <p> Off their reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>7 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is staring at an OKUDAGRAM of a DNA sequence<br>
    displayed on the wall monitor. Riker ENTERS and<br>
    crosses to her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> Beverly turns to him; her expression is grim.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's no question. It's Captain<br>
    Picard's DNA.</p>
  <p> Riker is impassive, his expression unreadable, but it's<br>
    all Beverly can do to keep from breaking down. It's<br>
    hard for her to admit it to herself; she desperately<br>
    wants to find some indication she's wrong, but she<br>
    knows she isn't.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I used a multi-base progression to<br>
    regenerate the DNA. The technique<br>
    is practically flawless...</p>
  <p> She continues to give her report, attempting to<br>
    submerge her feelings in her work.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The cellular damage could have<br>
    been caused by a variety of energy<br>
    fields... it's hard to be<br>
    specific. I can't tell whether it<br>
    was the field itself that killed<br>
    him or if he was already dead<br>
    when...</p>
  <p> She trails off, unable to continue. Riker wants to<br>
    comfort her, but there isn't much to say.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll need your analysis for my<br>
    report to Starfleet.</p>
  <p> She hands him a PADD.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's all here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'll inform the crew.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Beverly returns to her work, trying to<br>
    maintain her composure in the face of this tragedy.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker is working at his desk when door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The DOOR OPENS and Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How are you doing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm all right.</p>
  <p> The words are not convincing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The crew is pretty shaken up...<br>
    I'm arranging a memorial<br>
    service... I think you should be<br>
    the one to deliver the eulogy.</p>
  <p> There's a long beat before Riker answers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'd be better at something like<br>
    that. Or Beverly. She knew him<br>
    the longest...</p>
  <p> Troi knows he's avoiding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know it won't be easy... but<br>
    it's important for all of us to<br>
    face what's happened. You're in<br>
    command now. The crew will be<br>
    looking to you for guidance --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't understand. I can't<br>
    give the eulogy because I won't be<br>
    at the service.</p>
  <p> Troi is surprised at the extent of his denial.<br>
    Carefully --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    A memorial service helps to give<br>
    everyone a sense of completion.<br>
    Helps them begin the healing<br>
    process...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's exactly the point. I don't<br>
    want to heal.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wil --</p>
  <p> He touches his chest.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've got an open wound in here, it<br>
    hurts like hell, and I don't want<br>
    it to get better. I don't want to<br>
    believe that everything's all<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're angry...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're damn right. And I intend<br>
    to stay angry -- until I find<br>
    whoever's responsible for the<br>
    Captain's death.</p>
  <p> Troi's patience evaporates. She's hurting, too, and<br>
    her professional demeanor crumbles under the strain.</p>

  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's pretty selfish, Wil.<br>
    (a beat as Riker is<br>
    taken aback)<br>
    Do you think you're the only one<br>
    in pain? That you have a monopoly<br>
    on loss? Well, I've got news for<br>
    you. We're all hurting... we're<br>
    all angry. And like it or not,<br>
    you've got a responsibility to the<br>
    crew. You can't just indulge your<br>
    personal desire for revenge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (harshly)<br>
    That's enough, Counselor.</p>
  <p> They stare at each other, she still bristling, he<br>
    jolted by her anger and vehemence. He regrets his<br>
    attack.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing, softer)<br>
    I'm sorry.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Deanna. This isn't about revenge.<br>
    It's about justice. The Captain<br>
    died in a bar fight... for<br>
    nothing. Somebody has to answer<br>
    for that.<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander. We are receiving a<br>
    transmission from Admiral Chekote<br>
    at Starbase two-twenty-seven.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Put it through to the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS to...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>10 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Riker ENTERS, he stops; he stares at Picard's empty<br>
    desk for a brief moment, feeling everything it<br>
    represents... and then, decisively, he moves and sits<br>
    down -- there will be time to remember later.</p>
  <p> He activates the desk terminal, and the image of<br>
    ADMIRAL CHEKOTE appears on the monitor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> CHEKOTE<br>
    I've read your report, Commander.<br>
    My condolences to you and your<br>
    crew. Captain Picard's death is<br>
    a loss to the entire Federation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I see you've asked to postpone<br>
    your mission to the Argus<br>
    sector... for what reason?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have a request, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd like to conduct an<br>
    investigation into Captain<br>
    Picard's death.</p>
  <p> CHEKOTE<br>
    The Dessican authorities have<br>
    jurisdiction in this case,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know that, sir. But frankly, I<br>
    don't have much confidence in the<br>
    authorities on Dessica Two.<br>
    There's every reason to believe<br>
    they're corrupt.</p>
  <p> CHEKOTE<br>
    I suspect you're right. But the<br>
    question remains... are you the<br>
    one to pursue this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, the Captain's death has hit<br>
    me pretty hard. I may not be<br>
    completely objective... but no one<br>
    is more determined than I am.<br>

  <p> CHEKOTE<br>
    All right, Commander. I'm<br>
    officially placing the Enterprise<br>
    on detached duty. Your mission is<br>
    at your discretion. Good luck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Off Riker's determined expression...</p>
  <p>11 INT. YRANAC'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS to find Yranac sitting at a table<br>
    surrounded by a huge assortment of food, eating<br>
    heartily. Riker is carrying a PADD.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Ah, Commander Riker. I've been<br>
    meaning to speak to you. I was<br>
    wondering if you could move me to<br>
    better quarters. I don't care<br>
    much for the decor here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    These are the best quarters we<br>
    have.</p>
  <p> Yranac shrugs and continues eating.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now that you've had some time to<br>
    relax, I was hoping you might have<br>
    remembered some details about the<br>
    aliens you saw... something you'd<br>
    forgotten earlier.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Sorry. My memory isn't what it<br>
    used to be.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker suspects that Yranac knows more than he's<br>
    telling, but Yranac's being cagey -- he's protecting<br>
    every scrap of information he's got so he has something<br>
    to bargain with. Riker's task is to get him to admit<br>
    to as much as he can.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You said the aliens looked<br>
    dangerous. How could you tell?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    They killed someone. I'd say that<br>
    qualifies them as dangerous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But you said that you noticed they<br>
    looked dangerous before the fight<br>
    even started. What made you think<br>
    that? Were they unusually<br>
    aggressive... ? Were they heavily<br>
    armed... ?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    I don't recall.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They murdered a man in plain view<br>
    of everyone in that bar... and you<br>
    can't remember anything about<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Now that you mention it, I do<br>
    remember one thing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They said they'd kill anyone who<br>
    talked about what happened.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But you offered to help us.</p>
  <p> Yranac shrugs; he feels secure enough to admit this<br>
    much.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    You're right. I saw a business<br>
    opportunity. And besides, they<br>
    were gone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know where they went?</p>
  <p> Yranac doesn't answer and instead simply smiles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You know who they are and you know<br>
    where I can find them.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Perhaps I do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> Yranac thinks he's tantalized Riker enough.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Not a great deal, Commander. Just<br>
    a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd<br>
    like to travel for a while, see<br>
    more of the galaxy. You<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A shuttlecraft?<br>
    (beat; smiles)<br>
    Well, here's my offer. Instead of<br>
    a ship, I'm going to give you some<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Time?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you're lucky, you'll only have<br>
    to spend the next five years in<br>
    prison instead of the next twenty.</p>
  <p> Riker grabs Yranac by the front of the shirt and draws<br>
    him to within an inch of his face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You've got twelve outstanding<br>
    arrest warrants for fraud and<br>
    petty theft in the Klingon Empire.<br>
    If you tell me what you know, I'll<br>
    pull a few strings... maybe get<br>
    them to reduce your sentence after<br>
    you're extradited.</p>
  <p> Yranac is in a full-blown panic.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    You can't turn me over to the<br>
    Klingons. They don't just<br>
    imprison you... Do you know what<br>
    the punishment is for fraud?</p>
  <p> Riker knows exactly what it is.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. I certainly do.</p>
  <p> Yranac is terrified at the prospect, but he's still<br>
    trying to bargain his way out.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    If I tell you what I know, you<br>
    must promise you won't give me to<br>
    the Klingons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll think about it.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    Perhaps you could send me to a<br>
    Federation rehabilitation colony<br>
    instead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Talk!</p>
  <p> Yranac slumps; he's played all his cards and he's lost.<br>
    His only chance now is to tell the truth.</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    The aliens were some kind of<br>
    mercenary group. They've been<br>
    operating in this sector for the<br>
    last six months.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where do we find them?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    I heard one of them mention the<br>
    Barradas system... I think they<br>
    were headed there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You think?</p>
  <p> YRANAC<br>
    (miserable)<br>
    That's all I know.</p>

    Barradas Three is the only M-class<br>
    planet in this system, and it is<br>
    listed as unpopulated. However,<br>
    sensors have detected intermittent<br>
    energy signals emanating from its<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's the source?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The signals are difficult to<br>
    localize, but... they might be<br>
    emissions from some kind of power<br>
    converter...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Which could indicate a base or a<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    Barradas Three?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The planet was an outpost of the<br>

    Mister Data, you have the Bridge.</p>

    He's not.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I realize that, sir. But if he<br>

  <p> Riker, Geordi, Worf, and two Security Officers, N.D. #1<br>
    and N.D. #2, are in a large clearing. The forest has<br>
    encroached on a variety of simple ruins; however, in<br>
    several places through the site, there are strange<br>
    INDENTATIONS in the ground: smooth, circularly-shaped<br>
    holes which almost suggest that something was scooped<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> Geordi, Worf and N.D. #1 are equipped with tricorders;<br>
    the entire team is armed with phasers.</p>

  <p>17 RIKER AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> are standing together as Geordi scans the site; the<br>
    others continue working in the b.g.</p>
  <p> Geordi works his tricorder with frustration; he's<br>
    having trouble getting clear readings.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's tough to get accurate sensor<br>
    readings... there's a lot of<br>
    interference in the area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From what?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure... it's unlocalized.<br>
    It could be atmospheric...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you make of this?</p>
  <p> Riker moves near one of the circular indentations in<br>
    the ground. Geordi kneels down and examines the ground<br>
    with his VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The ruins are ancient... but I'd<br>
    say this indentation was made<br>
    fairly recently...<br>
    (unconvinced)<br>
    There might have been a battle<br>
    here...</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have found something.</p>
  <p> Worf points down at TWO ARTIFACTS which are lying in<br>
    the grass. There are no other ruins nearby, and the<br>
    artifacts look completely out of place where they are.<br>
    Riker stares at them, puzzled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (musing)<br>
    It almost looks as if someone...<br>
    dropped them --</p>
  <p> Without warning, a PHASER BLAST hits N.D. #1 square in<br>
    the chest; he goes down instantly.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf dive for safety behind some nearby<br>
    ruins; Riker and N.D. #2 are forced away from the<br>
    others in order to find cover.</p>
  <p>19 THE SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The phaser fire came from the trees ahead of the Away<br>
    Team; as the action plays out, we will see the<br>
    attackers. They are a team of THREE ARMED MERCENARIES:<br>
    the leader, a Romulan female, TALLERA; a large,<br>
    intimidating alien female, VEKOR; and an alien male,<br>

    the large monitor which is displaying a graphic of the<br>
    mercenary ship and other associated information.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Starfleet Intelligence has<br>
    confirmed that a ship matching<br>
    this configuration has been linked<br>
    to raids on several other planets<br>
    in this sector.</p>
  <p> Everyone is frustrated, but Geordi and Worf are<br>
    particularly restive; they're upset with what they<br>
    perceive to be their failure on the surface, and it's<br>
    difficult for them to sit patiently through Data's<br>
    careful, measured briefing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For the short time it was within<br>
    our visual range, we were able to<br>
    take sensor readings of the<br>
    mercenary vessel.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It appears to be encased in an<br>
    energy-absorbing material.<br>
    Although we can see the ship, this<br>
    energy sheath renders it virtually<br>
    undetectable to our long-range<br>
    sensors.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There must be some way to track<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Geordi consults a PADD in front of him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, I know this is a long<br>
    shot... but if I remodulate the<br>
    long-range sensor array, I might<br>
    be able to increase its<br>
    sensitivity enough to detect the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Data is not convinced.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Without a full compositional<br>
    analysis of the energy sheath, the<br>
    chances of finding the correct<br>
    remodulation sequence are remote.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Furthermore, based on their speed,<br>
    they could be as far as two-point-three-seven<br>
    light years from this<br>
    location.</p>

  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Troi, Geordi, and Worf react; that's a lot of space to<br>
    search. But Worf is not ready to give up yet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That means they must still be<br>
    within this sector. If we used<br>
    all available shuttlecraft to<br>
    conduct a level-one search --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would still take at least ten<br>
    days to complete. In that time<br>
    the mercenaries would continue to<br>
    distance themselves from us.</p>
  <p> Data's logic is relentless -- and a little irritating.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    Sir. They have taken Commander<br>
    Riker. We must do something. We<br>
    cannot just sit here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    On the contrary, Lieutenant, that<br>
    is precisely what we must do.</p>
  <p> Data continues, unaware of the mounting frustration in<br>
    the room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Since there are no viable<br>
    alternatives, we will return to<br>
    the surface and attempt to<br>
    determine what the mercenaries<br>
    were doing on this planet. An<br>
    investigation may reveal some<br>
    indication of their purpose.<br>
    Notify me when you have assembled<br>
    your search teams.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Data has made it very clear just who is in command.<br>
    The situation makes Troi, Geordi and Worf a little<br>
    uncomfortable, but they all know how to follow orders.<br>
    They EXIT unhappily. Off Data's determined expression.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>36 INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Tallera (the Romulan female we saw earlier) is leading<br>
    a groggy Riker across the room as he struggles<br>
    painfully back to consciousness. Riker's combadge is<br>
    gone and there is now a small patch-like device (like<br>
    all the other mercenaries wear) at the side of his<br>
    throat.</p>
  <p> The mercenary bridge is sleek and spare with no wasted<br>
    space, just like everything on this ship. A large<br>
    Viewscreen dominates the forward section and there's a<br>
    small Transporter pad in one corner. The walls are<br>
    lined with consoles which are manned by various N.D.<br>
    MERCENARIES. The ALERT LIGHTS are active, and there is<br>
    a tense, urgent feeling on the bridge.</p>
  <p> In the center of the bridge is a raised platform<br>
    encircled by a rail and a console. From here, the<br>
    Captain commands an unobstructed view of the entire<br>
    room. It should feel as though this ship and crew are<br>
    always ready for battle.</p>
  <p> Tallera pushes Riker against the rail and stares at him<br>
    silently.</p>
  <p> The mercenary captain, BARAN, stands on his platform.<br>
    He's a humanoid male alien, intelligent, muscular -- a<br>
    man to be reckoned with. Baran is wearing a small<br>
    CONTROL DEVICE at his belt.</p>
  <p> Baran is engaged in a heated conversation with the<br>
    engineer, Narik, and for the moment, ignores Riker and<br>
    Tallera.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    (upset)<br>
    I warned you not to push the<br>
    engines so hard. Two of the power<br>
    shunts are on the verge of<br>
    collapse. We'll be lucky if we<br>
    can maintain warp six.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    How long will it take to repair?</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    I can try to realign the warp<br>
    core... it'll take at least<br>
    eleven hours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I'll have to shut the engines<br>
    down completely.</p>
  <p> Baran fixes Narik with a hard look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    We're not stopping. We can't<br>
    afford to be sitting helpless in<br>
    space. I want warp eight<br>
    available in five hours. And I'm<br>
    not going to listen to your<br>
    excuses.</p>
  <p> Narik glares angrily at Baran but does not dispute him.<br>
    He nods and moves to a console in the b.g. Baran then<br>
    turns and stares coldly at Riker.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    What were you doing on Barradas<br>
    Three?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (all I'm saying)<br>
    William T. Riker, Commander, SC<br>
    two-three-one dash four-two-seven.</p>
  <p> Baran cocks his head and regards him. Is he going to<br>
    play this silly game?</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    All right. I am Arctus Baran...<br>
    and I don't have a number.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now. What were you doing on<br>
    Barradas Three -- Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We were studying the ruins. It<br>
    was a scientific expedition.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Don't patronize me. Those ruins<br>
    have been studied for centuries.<br>
    There's nothing new to learn from<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what were you doing there?</p>
  <p> Baran smiles, acknowledging the riposte. Then he takes<br>
    the device at his belt and activates it. Riker sinks<br>
    to his knees, gasping, in tremendous pain.<br>
    Instinctively, he tries to pull the patch off his neck.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Don't bother, Commander, you can't<br>
    remove it. It's a neural servo.<br>
    It's connected directly to your<br>
    nervous system.<br>

    It lets me control precisely how<br>
    much pain you feel.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This setting is usually<br>
    sufficient.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, if necessary it can go<br>
    much higher.</p>
  <p> Baran lets Riker writhe in pain for a beat before he<br>
    shuts off the device. Riker's pain stops and he<br>
    groans, barely able to speak, exhausted by the ordeal.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    These devices were my<br>
    predecessor's idea... a convenient<br>
    way of enforcing discipline...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (weakly)<br>
    What happened to him?</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (I got rid of him)<br>
    He failed to discipline me<br>
    sufficiently...</p>
  <p> The female alien, Vekor, moves near the platform.</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    This is a waste of time, Baran.<br>
    Get rid of him now.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    You should be more patient, Vekor.<br>
    It can be rewarding.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We will wait. Let the memory of<br>
    his pain argue with him for a<br>
    while... maybe it will change his<br>
    attitude.</p>
  <p> Narik steps forward.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    Vekor's right -- we should get rid<br>
    of him. It's dangerous to have<br>
    someone from Starfleet on board.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Dangerous? It might be<br>
    profitable. A Starfleet Commander<br>
    is a valuable hostage.</p>

    Starfleet won't negotiate with us.<br>
    But they'll pursue us as long as<br>
    we have him.</p>
  <p> We're beginning to see that this crew is not just one<br>
    harmonious, happy team. Everyone is suspicious of the<br>
    others and everyone is looking out for himself first.</p>
  <p> Baran presses his pain control briefly; Vekor cries out<br>
    and staggers back.</p>

  <p>38 INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (CONTINUOUS)</p>
  <p> Riker is completely stunned at the sight of Picard, but<br>
    he quickly controls himself -- before he says anything,<br>
    he has to figure out what's going on here.</p>
  <p> Picard, however, doesn't even give Riker a second<br>
    glance; his attention is focused entirely on Baran.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: Riker)<br>
    If he has nothing to give us, then<br>
    we should kill him now and be done<br>
    with it. Everyone seems to<br>
    recognize that fact except you.</p>
  <p> Picard speaks harshly, with a violent edge that's only<br>
    barely restrained.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I don't need a consensus to run<br>
    this ship, Galen.</p>
  <p> This is not the first argument Baran and Picard have<br>
    had, and the hostility between the two men is evident.<br>
    Picard is about to respond when suddenly, the SHIP<br>
    SHUDDERS slightly and the LIGHTS DIM.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> Narik quickly moves to monitor one of the consoles in<br>
    the b.g.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    We're bypassing the aft plasma<br>
    couplings... the power loss should<br>
    only last a few seconds...</p>
  <p> A short beat passes and the lights return to normal.<br>
    Baran returns his attention to Picard.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    You should learn not to limit your<br>
    options. Riker could be useful to<br>
    us in the future.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    ... if this is the same Riker I've<br>
    heard about.</p>
  <p> Riker is deeply confused; he doesn't know what Picard<br>

    to try and play along.</p>

    He was even relieved of duty once,<br>

  <p> But before Baran can reply, the SHIP SHUDDERS again.<br>
    For a moment, everyone thinks it's just Narik making<br>
    repairs like before... and then suddenly, the ship<br>
    LURCHES FORWARD, accelerating rapidly; the ALARM<br>

  <p> Baran reacts, concerned; he shoves Riker toward an ND<br>

  <p> Riker is alone and thoroughly agitated -- he's got<br>
    plenty of questions and no answers. Suddenly, the DOOR<br>
    OPENS and Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We don't have much time...</p>
  <p> Picard is rushed and urgent, but he is no longer the<br>
    violent, angry character he was on the bridge -- this<br>
    is the Picard Riker knows.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I hardly expected to see you here,<br>
    Wil.</p>
  <p> For a brief moment, Riker just stares at him; he's not<br>
    sure how to react.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was trying to find the people<br>
    who killed you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A witness in that bar saw you<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    These mercenaries use weapons<br>
    which activate their Transporter.<br>
    It allows them to beam away<br>
    objects quickly, by simply firing<br>
    at them. That's what they did to<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Riker's totally frustrated -- he wants answers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't understand any of this.<br>
    Who are these people? How did you<br>
    get involved with them?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One of the sites I wanted to study<br>
    had been raided. A lot of<br>
    artifacts were stolen... the site<br>
    was practically destroyed. I<br>
    wanted to find who was<br>
    responsible.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I tracked them to the bar on<br>

    too many questions... They<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what we have to find out.<br>

  <p> Picard is trying to make this look like an<br>

    Our next objective is located in<br>

    Calder Two.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- he recognizes the name.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Calder Two isn't just another<br>
    archaeological site. There's a<br>
    Federation outpost there.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (dismissive)<br>
    I don't see that as a problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's defended by Starfleet.<br>
    They're not going to just stand by<br>
    while we walk in and take whatever<br>
    we want.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I'm aware of the tactical<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    What are their defenses?</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Nothing to worry about. They have<br>
    a type-four deflector shield<br>
    protecting the outpost and the<br>
    ruins.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They'll also have a minimum of two<br>
    phaser banks... and possibly even<br>
    photon torpedoes. Is that enough<br>
    to worry about?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    How do you know so much about this<br>
    outpost?</p>

    ago. I barely got away in one<br>
    piece.</p>
  <p> Baran can feel the group losing confidence in his plan.<br>
    He moves quickly to reassure them.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Our weapons are more than a match<br>
    for their defenses. I anticipate<br>
    we'll be able to destroy the<br>
    outpost in less than fifteen<br>
    minutes. After that, we'll send<br>
    in Tallera and the landing party<br>
    to secure the relics.</p>
  <p> Picard is in very difficult position: he has to protect<br>
    the outpost, but at the same time, Picard wants Baran<br>
    to succeed with the raid so that he'll be able to<br>
    continue his mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fifteen minutes is more than<br>
    enough time to transmit a distress<br>
    call.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    By the time they're able to detect<br>
    us, we'll be jamming their<br>
    communications. They'll have no<br>
    chance to send a message.</p>
  <p> The others mercenaries are not so confident.</p>
  <p> NARIK<br>
    But our sensors will be useless as<br>
    well.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Starfleet's already searching for<br>
    this ship. They could be on top<br>
    of us without our realizing it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's right. And our landing party<br>
    would be stranded on the surface.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    That's a risk I'm prepared to<br>
    take.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's because you won't be down<br>
    there... your life won't be at<br>
    risk.</p>
  <p> Baran bristles at the implication.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    If we don't find what we're<br>
    looking for, none of our lives<br>
    will be worth anything.</p>
  <p> Picard seizes on this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why? Who are we working for?</p>
  <p> Baran has no intention of answering the question.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    All you need to know is that we<br>
    have to attack that outpost. We<br>
    don't have a choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe we do.<br>

    security without raising any<br>
    suspicions.<br>

    with Picard.</p>
  <p> VEKOR<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Why would Riker help us? Just<br>
    because he's out of favor with<br>
    Starfleet doesn't mean he's ready<br>
    to betray them.</p>

    I don't like operating in the<br>
    dark. If I knew what the point of<br>
    this mission were... why I'm<br>
    scanning these relics...</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    If Baran felt it were wise to let<br>
    the crew know that, I'm sure he<br>
    would have.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard assesses her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you know what this is all<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> She smiles, an enigmatic smile that suggests a special<br>
    relationship between her and Baran.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    What Baran knows, I know...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then tell me what we're doing<br>
    here. Why are we risking our<br>
    lives taking these artifacts? Who<br>
    wants them?</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I see no reason to tell you<br>
    anything... but you can rest<br>
    assured I don't necessarily share<br>
    everything I know with Baran,<br>
    either.</p>
  <p> A beat as she moves closer to him.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (softly)<br>
    This conversation, for example...<br>
    will stay between us.</p>
  <p> He gives her a look. Is there a hint of complicity?<br>
    Of seduction?</p>
  <p> He can't be sure what this mysterious woman is getting<br>
    at, but he certainly doesn't trust her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can tell him every word I've<br>
    said. He knows I don't think he's<br>
    much of a leader.</p>
  <p> Tallera takes a step back, as though feeling a rebuff.<br>
    The edge has returned to her voice.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    He's been in charge of this crew<br>
    for a long time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He wouldn't be captain for five<br>
    minutes if he didn't have the<br>
    control device.<br>

  <p>50 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    The crew follows him because they<br>
    have no choice. Baran's power is<br>
    based only on fear and<br>
    intimidation.</p>
  <p> Tallera regards him gravely, probing, trying to assess<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    That almost sounds like a prelude<br>
    to mutiny...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If someone were to challenge Baran --<br>
    the crew would follow.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I was right. You do like living<br>
    dangerously...</p>
  <p> There is a beat as she moves closer to him.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I like you, Galen. I can tolerate<br>
    a lot from someone like you... but<br>
    only to a point.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I intend to complete this mission<br>
    successfully and get what's been<br>
    promised me. If it looks as<br>
    though you're getting in the way<br>
    of that... I'll deal with you<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> She turns and EXITS. Picard stares after her, trying<br>
    to gauge just how formidable she really is.</p>

  <p>51 EXT. SPACE - THE MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> enters orbit around Calder Two.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>52 INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Tallera, Narik, and Vekor are in the b.g. at<br>
    various stations. Riker is talking to a Starfleet<br>
    Officer, LIEUTENANT SANDERS, on a monitor at one of the<br>
    consoles. Baran stands nearby, out of view of the<br>
    screen, watching Riker carefully.</p>
  <p> SANDERS<br>
    Commander, no one is allowed on<br>
    the surface without prior<br>
    authorization from the Federation<br>
    Science Council.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but<br>
    the outpost is in imminent danger<br>
    of attack. I want to station<br>
    security personnel on the surface<br>
    to protect you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am ordering you to drop your<br>
    shields.</p>
  <p> Sanders takes his time considering.</p>
  <p> SANDERS<br>
    I'm sorry, sir... but the<br>
    regulations are very specific. I<br>
    can't do it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you like, you can remain in<br>
    orbit until we contact the Science<br>
    Council, but we're experiencing<br>
    some communication difficulties<br>
    right now, so it might take some<br>
    time --</p>
  <p> Baran abruptly cuts off the transmission.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (angry)<br>
    They're delaying on purpose.<br>
    Someone has warned them.</p>
  <p> Baran gestures to an N.D. at the weapons console.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Charge main disruptor array...<br>
    destroy the outpost.</p>
  <p> Picard sees that although there's no longer any way to<br>
    avoid a battle, there might still be a way to save the<br>
    people below -- but he has to act quickly. Picard<br>
    moves to the weapons console and moves the N.D. out of<br>
    the way...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - REV. 07/28/93 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That would take too long.<br>
    Starfleet might be here any<br>
    minute...</p>
  <p> Picard begins working the console...</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm configuring the disruptors to<br>
    fire a phase-resonant pulse... If<br>
    I can hit their shield generator<br>
    at precisely the right frequency,<br>
    I should be able to knock it off-line<br>
    with a single shot...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Firing...</p>
  <p> We hear the SOUND of disruptors firing... A tense<br>
    beat...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Their shields are down...</p>
  <p> Baran and Picard exchange a brief glance.</p>
  <p>53 BARAN</p>
  <p> moves quickly to Tallera's station. Tallera is<br>
    studying her console intently.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    The artifacts should be located in<br>
    several small structures...<br>
    arranged in staggered<br>
    formations...</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I'm scanning...</p>
  <p> Tallera works the console for a beat.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    I think I've found them.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Lock the coordinates and start<br>
    bringing them up.</p>
  <p> Tallera works her console...</p>
  <p>54 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as several artifacts MATERIALIZE on the Transporter<br>
    pad.</p>
  <p>55 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    There should be at least two more<br>
    pieces down there.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I've got them --</p>
  <p> Tallera suddenly looks up from her console.</p>
  <p> TALLERA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've lost transporter lock.</p>
  <p> Picard breaks in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They've managed to get their<br>
    shields back up.</p>
  <p> Baran moves to Picard.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    I need those artifacts. Lock all<br>
    disruptors on target... this time<br>
    I want that outpost destroyed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- there's no way he can disobey the<br>
    order... Picard moves to the weapons control<br>
    station...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES -- it's been hit.</p>
  <p>56 OMITTED</p>
  <p>57 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is at command and Troi is at her station; Worf is<br>
    at tactical and Giusti at ops.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Direct hit on their aft deflector,<br>
    sir... They are undamaged.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ensign, scan for Starfleet<br>
    combadge signals. Is Commander<br>
    Riker aboard that ship?</p>
  <p> GIUSTI<br>
    (works console)<br>
    I can't tell, sir. Sensors are<br>
    unable to penetrate their hull.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Open a channel.<br>

    This is the Federation Starship<br>

  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Baran instantly accuses Riker.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    You sent them a message... you<br>
    told them where to find us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's ridiculous... when did I<br>
    have the chance?</p>
  <p> Baran has one option left. He takes out his pain<br>
    control device and shows it pointedly to Riker.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    This is set to kill.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Order your ship to disengage.</p>
  <p> He shoves Riker in front of the main Viewscreen.</p>

    Commander. Are you all right?</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>60 INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    (insistent)<br>
    Tell them!</p>
  <p> Riker has an idea... he's going to make a desperate<br>
    gamble.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hard)<br>
    Withdraw the Enterprise, Mister<br>
    Data. That's an order.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Sir, that is impossible. The ship<br>
    you are on has violated a<br>
    Federation outpost. It is my duty<br>
    to stop it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm your commanding officer and<br>
    I'm giving you a direct order.<br>
    Understood?</p>
  <p> Worf and Data exchange a look. What the hell is going<br>
    on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, if you could explain --</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>61 INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never explained my orders to<br>
    you before and I'm not going to<br>
    start now.</p>
  <p> Riker cuts off the transmission and turns quickly to<br>
    Baran.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have no intention of letting<br>
    them blow us into space.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If I can set up a low energy com<br>
    link between the ships... I can<br>
    use my personal command codes to<br>
    deactivate their shields.</p>
  <p> Baran looks at him for a quick beat and then indicates<br>
    a nearby console.</p>
  <p> BARAN<br>
    Do it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Gambit, Part I&quot; - REV. 07/28/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker moves to the console and begins working<br>
    furiously.</p>
  <p>62 INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Everyone is still mystified by Riker's behavior.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor, could Commander Riker<br>
    have been drugged or mentally<br>
    altered in some way to explain<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't sense anything which<br>
    would indicate that...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Commander, we are receiving some<br>
    kind of signal from the mercenary<br>
    ship...<br>
    (beat; astonished)<br>
    These are Commander Riker's access<br>
    codes... he is attempting to shut<br>
    down our shields...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That doesn't make any sense. He<br>
    knows those codes would have been<br>
    changed as soon as he was<br>
    captured...</p>
  <p> A beat as Data considers this strange situation.<br>
    Then...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct, Counselor. He<br>
    does know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Worf. Prepare to drop the<br>
    shields.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (astonished)<br>
    Sir? We will be totally<br>
    defenseless.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am aware of that.</p>

    That is an order.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye-aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Worf works his console.</p>
  <p>63 INT. MERCENARY SHIP</p>
  <p> Riker, Picard, Baran, and Tallera are gathered around<br>
    a console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It worked! Their shields are<br>
