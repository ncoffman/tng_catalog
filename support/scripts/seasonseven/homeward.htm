    &quot;Homeward&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a planet. The atmosphere appears<br>
    turbulent and dangerous.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47423.9.<br>
    We have arrived at Boraal Two in<br>
    response to an emergency distress<br>
    call from Lieutenant Worf's foster<br>
    brother, Nikolai Rozhenko. He has<br>
    been stationed on the planet as a<br>
    cultural observer.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are at their stations; DATA is at Ops;<br>
    WORF is at Tactical; assorted N.D.s man the other<br>
    stations. The mood is serious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, analysis.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It appears the planet's atmosphere<br>
    is dissipating, sir. Intense<br>
    plasmonic reactions are destroying<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How far has it progressed?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The stratosphere is already<br>
    breaking down, and there are<br>
    turbulent radiation storms across<br>
    much of the surface.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I estimate the planet will be<br>
    uninhabitable in less than thirty-eight<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> Reactions to the grim news.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The distress call was only four<br>
    days ago. Why would Doctor<br>
    Rozhenko have waited so long<br>
    before sending it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Atmospheric dissipation is a rare<br>
    and essentially unpredictable<br>
    event. When it occurs, it<br>
    proceeds rapidly. Doctor Rozhenko<br>
    would not have had much warning.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES and the LIGHTS FLICKER<br>
    momentarily.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The dissipation effect is<br>
    generating plasmonic energy<br>
    bursts...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are they any danger to the ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe so. However, we<br>
    may experience intermittent system<br>
    failures and power surges as a<br>
    result.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep an eye on it.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Worf who's busy working his console.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Mister Worf. Any luck?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is still no response to our<br>
    hails, sir... I am attempting to<br>
    scan the observation post...</p>
  <p> Worf works his console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    He could be hurt... maybe he can't<br>
    respond...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensor interference is<br>
    significant, but the post appears<br>
    to be intact... its power grid is<br>
    still functioning...</p>
  <p> Worf is struggling to hide his concern.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    However, I am reading no life<br>
    forms within the structure.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It's hard to believe he would have<br>
    left the post...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Especially under these<br>
    circumstances...</p>
  <p> Meanwhile, Worf has been continuing to scan, and now he<br>
    breaks in anxiously.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Sir, I am detecting faint power<br>
    emissions from a system of caverns<br>
    near the post. It could be a<br>
    deflector shield.</p>
  <p> Reactions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It can't be native to the planet.<br>
    The Boraalans don't have anything<br>
    close to that level of technology.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain. Request permission to<br>
    lead an Away Team.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. But regardless of this<br>
    planet's immediate situation, we<br>
    must still observe the Prime<br>
    Directive.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd like to minimize the risk of<br>
    contact with the inhabitants.<br>
    You're to go alone, Mister Worf --<br>
    and I want you surgically altered<br>
    to pass as a Boraalan.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS via the aft Turbolift and an N.D. moves to<br>
    take his station. Off Picard and Riker's expressions.</p>
  <p>3 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Worf is on the clamshell bed as BEVERLY scans his head<br>
    with an OPTICAL SCANNER. A few additional MEDICAL<br>
    INSTRUMENTS are nearby.</p>
  <p> Worf is impatient and distracted, and he's not doing a<br>
    very good job of keeping his head still; Beverly stops<br>
    scanning.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf, you have to try to keep<br>
    still. I need an accurate scan of<br>
    your cranial anatomy...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'm sorry, Doctor. Please<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> Worf composes himself, attempting to keep still;<br>
    Beverly resets the scan and begins again.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're worried about Nikolai,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are the two of you close?</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation before Worf answers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are... brothers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 10/28/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> But Beverly has noticed the hesitation. She keeps<br>
    taking measurements as she tries casually to draw him<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You've never talked much about<br>
    him. What's he like?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    Nikolai is older than I... and we<br>
    are not -- alike. We had many<br>
    disagreements as we were growing<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's not unusual.</p>
  <p> Again, Worf hesitates. He's trying gingerly to<br>
    describe his brother without sounding disparaging.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nikolai... has a mind of his own.<br>
    He attended Starfleet Academy --<br>
    but he was unable to follow the<br>
    rules. He left after one year.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, he has many fine<br>
    qualities. He is... brilliant.<br>
    Persuasive. A natural leader...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sounds intriguing... I look<br>
    forward to meeting him.</p>
  <p> Worf gives her a look, but does not reply. For now,<br>
    Worf has said all he has to say on the matter.</p>
  <p>4 INT. PASSAGEWAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A dark passageway in a cavernous underground region of<br>
    the planet. We hear the familiar hum of the<br>
    Transporter and then WORF MATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> We see that Worf has been surgically altered to look<br>
    like one of the Boraal (precise physical features TBD),<br>
    and is dressed in simple, loose-fitting clothes.</p>
  <p> Worf takes out a TRICORDER and scans the area for a<br>
    beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    Worf to Enterprise...</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (fritzed)<br>
    Go ahead...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am picking up faint life signs<br>
    approximately two-hundred meters<br>
    from my position. I am heading<br>
    toward them.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    (fritzed)<br>
    Understood. The plasmonic<br>
    interference is getting worse...<br>
    start checking in every thirty<br>
    minutes to make sure we have a fix<br>
    on you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf moves off.</p>
  <p>5 ANOTHER SECTION OF PASSAGEWAY</p>
  <p> Worf is moving slowly and carefully, continuing to scan<br>
    with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> VORIN (O.S.)<br>
    What are you doing here... ?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the voice and quickly conceals his<br>
    tricorder. He turns to see a figure moving towards<br>
    him...</p>
  <p>6 VORIN</p>
  <p> an adult, Boraalan male, emerges from a dark<br>
    passageway, holding an ALIEN OIL LAMP. He is dressed<br>
    in clothes similar to Worf's. A POUCH containing many<br>
    ORNATE PAPER SCROLLS is slung over his shoulder.</p>
  <p>7 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Vorin cautiously approaches Worf.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    You're not from our village. Who<br>
    are you?</p>
  <p> As Vorin speaks, an elderly Boraalan male, KATERAS,<br>
    emerges from the passage to join him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KATERAS<br>
    Who is this... ?</p>
  <p> His voice trails off as he sees Worf. This is<br>
    absolutely the last thing Worf needed, and he tries to<br>
    cover for himself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My name is Worf. I am a...<br>
    traveller...</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    How did you survive the storms?</p>
  <p> Worf has run out of answers when a deep, strong voice<br>
    booms out of the darkness.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI (O.S.)<br>
    I'd recognize that voice anywhere.<br>
    Is it really you, Worf?</p>
  <p>8 NIKOLAI ROZHENKO</p>
  <p> approaches from another direction, leading another N.D.<br>
    BORAALAN and an adult Boraalan female, DOBARA. Nikolai<br>
    is a large, powerfully-built human, but as he comes<br>
    closer, we see that his features are similar to Worf's --<br>
    Nikolai also looks like a Boraalan.</p>
  <p>9 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Nikolai moves towards Worf.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    It's good to see you...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You've changed a lot in four<br>
    years...</p>
  <p> Worf isn't exactly sure how to react, and he has to<br>
    stare for a moment before he recognizes who it is.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nikolai... ?</p>
  <p> Nikolai grins broadly and engulfs Worf in a huge bear<br>
    hug, genuinely glad to see him. Nikolai turns to the<br>
    Boraal, introducing Worf with a theatrical gesture.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    This is my brother, Worf...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He's come to help us.</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's confused expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>10 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> It's a larger, more open, section of the caves. Small<br>
    collections of SUPPLIES, including a few ALIEN OIL<br>
    LAMPS, are scattered throughout the area, suggesting<br>
    that the Boraalans have been here for several days.<br>
    There is a CAMPFIRE in the center, and off in a corner,<br>
    an underground spring has formed a natural POOL.</p>
  <p> Several more N.D. BORAALANS are here, including a young<br>
    woman, TARRANA. The Boraalans all wear simple, loose-fitting<br>
    clothes. (NOTE: these people are not primitive<br>
    tribesmen. They could be thought of as similar in<br>
    development to Arabs of the late Middle Ages -- they'd<br>
    be able to build and use a telescope or a sextant, but<br>
    they might also believe in magic.)</p>
  <p> Nikolai ENTERS leading Worf and the other Boraalans<br>
    from the passageway.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    If you were able to get here, the<br>
    storms must have subsided... Do<br>
    you think it's safe enough to<br>
    return to the surface?</p>
  <p> Worf has no idea what's going on here. He needs to<br>
    talk to Nikolai -- alone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Please... I must speak with my<br>
    brother for a moment...</p>
  <p> Worf quickly takes Nikolai aside so they can talk<br>
    privately. Worf keeps his voice low and controlled,<br>
    but he's clearly angry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Nikolai, what have you done?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    They were dying.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI (Cont'd)<br>
    I refused to sit there... safe in<br>
    that observation post... and watch<br>
    it happen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I set up a deflector shield to<br>
    screen these caves from the<br>
    radiation and then I brought them<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What have you told them?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    They think I'm a Boraalan. I told<br>
    them I'm from another village far<br>
    from here.</p>
  <p> Worf relaxes slightly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    At least you had that much<br>
    sense...</p>
  <p> The two men look at each other.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I knew the Enterprise was in this<br>
    sector when I sent my distress<br>
    call... but I wasn't sure you'd be<br>
    the one to come.</p>
  <p> He places his hand on Worf's shoulder. Nikolai is<br>
    always very physical, never afraid to show his<br>
    feelings.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm truly glad you're here, Worf.</p>
  <p> Nikolai's words are heartfelt and Worf softens. He has<br>
    conflicting emotions: he's relieved to see his brother<br>
    alive, but he still feels Nikolai has really messed up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is nothing we can do for<br>
    these people. You have only<br>
    postponed their deaths.</p>
  <p> Nikolai responds with a look of determination.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I'd like to discuss that with your<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am certain he will want to speak<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> Worf and Nikolai hold each other's gaze for a beat.<br>
    Then Nikolai turns away and moves back to the group of<br>
    Boraalans.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Friends... Worf and I must return<br>
    to the surface...</p>
  <p> The news sends a concerned murmur through the group.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He has equipment and provisions<br>
    and needs help to bring them here.<br>
    We'll return shortly.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts -- surely Nikolai knows they can't come<br>
    back. Dobara seems particularly worried.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    It's too dangerous. The storms<br>
    can occur without warning. If<br>
    you're caught in one...</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Don't worry...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My brother is a seer. He<br>
    understands the nature of the<br>
    storms. He'll know when it's safe<br>
    to travel.</p>
  <p> Nikolai turns to Worf, looking for confirmation... and<br>
    Worf has no choice but to support him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> A murmur goes through the group -- they're very<br>
    impressed.</p>
  <p> KATERAS<br>
    (in awe)<br>

  <p> Worf reacts -- the attention is making him<br>
    uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    (to Worf and Nikolai)<br>
    Let me go with you. I know the<br>
    terrain better than anyone, and I<br>
    can help--</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    No, Vorin. Worf and I will be<br>
    fine. We'll be back soon.</p>

  <p>12 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, TROI, Beverly, Worf, and Nikolai. Worf<br>
    and Nikolai are back to normal: since their return to<br>
    the ship, their Boraalan get-up has been removed.</p>
  <p> Nikolai is on his feet, pacing -- he's vital and<br>
    energetic, a man with a mission trying to persuade<br>
    others.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, you were fully aware that<br>
    the atmospheric dissipation could<br>
    not be stopped. What were you<br>
    hoping to accomplish by assisting<br>
    these people?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I was trying to give them a<br>
    future.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I propose we create an atmospheric<br>
    shield on the planet. We can<br>
    camouflage the equipment just like<br>
    my observation post. No one will<br>
    ever know it's there.</p>
  <p> Astonished reactions around the table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can't be serious.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I realize it would only provide<br>
    atmosphere for a limited area of<br>
    the surface. But it would be<br>
    enough to save one village.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have no intention of compounding<br>
    what you've already done by<br>
    committing another gross violation<br>
    of the Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    The Boraalans have a rich and<br>
    beautiful culture... a deep<br>
    spiritual life. They deserve the<br>
    chance to survive.</p>
  <p> It's hard not to be moved by Nikolai's passion.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Isn't that what the Prime<br>
    Directive was truly intended to<br>
    do... allow cultures to survive<br>
    and grow naturally?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not entirely. The Prime Directive<br>
    was designed to ensure non-interference.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 10/29/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly is feeling a little conflicted -- she wishes<br>
    they could do something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But aren't we intefering either<br>
    way? If we take no action, it's<br>
    a conscious decision to let the<br>
    Boraalans die.</p>
  <p> Nikolai seizes on this.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Exactly.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We have the power to save some of<br>
    them... all we have to do is<br>
    exercise it.</p>
  <p> But Picard is not persuaded.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Prime Directive is a principle<br>
    we've all sworn to uphold. Until<br>
    that is changed, we cannot follow<br>
    any other course of action. Is<br>
    that understood?</p>
  <p> There's a long beat as Nikolai struggles to control his<br>
    emotions. Finally, he acquiesces.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    There are several log recorders in<br>
    my observation post... They<br>
    contain most of my research.<br>
    Since it appears that the only way<br>
    I'll be able to preserve Boraalan<br>
    culture is in a museum, I would<br>
    like permission to return to the<br>
    surface and retrieve them.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't want to make this any harder on Nikolai<br>
    that it already is, but Nikolai's ploy is transparent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid that won't be possible.<br>
    You may have full use of the<br>
    ship's computers to set up a com<br>
    link and upload your data from<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Nikolai nods silently. Picard looks around the somber<br>
    table.</p>

    If there's nothing further, you're<br>
    dismissed.</p>
  <p> The meeting breaks up. Everyone files out except<br>
    Nikolai who continues to sit, staring off into space.<br>
    Worf approaches him, trying to help.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Nikolai... I am sorry. I wish<br>
    there were another way.</p>
  <p> Nikolai doesn't respond; his expression is unreadable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing, presses on)<br>
    I am quite familiar with our<br>
    communications systems. If you<br>
    wish, I will help you set up your<br>
    com link.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    No. I'll do it myself.</p>
  <p> Then Nikolai abruptly gets up and EXITS. OFF Worf's<br>
    expression.</p>

    Captain, the atmospheric<br>
    dissipation has accelerated over<br>
    the past several hours. I<br>
    estimate the planet's atmosphere<br>
    will be completely gone within<br>
    four minutes.</p>
  <p> As Picard and Riker exchange a grim look, the aft<br>
    Turbolift DOORS OPEN and Nikolai ENTERS. He moves to<br>
    Picard; he seems uncharacteristically subdued.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Nikolai nods and moves to an aft science station; he<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears that the plasmonic<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought you'd already<br>
    compensated for that.</p>

    I had, sir...<br>

  <p> Data works his console for a beat. A moment later, the<br>

  <p> A beat, then Picard stands and addresses the entire<br>
    Bridge crew as he looks the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is one of the times when we<br>
    must face the ramifications of the<br>
    Prime Directive... and honor the<br>
    lives we cannot save.</p>
  <p> Nikolai moves away from his console.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I find no honor in this<br>
    whatsoever, Captain. You'll<br>
    excuse me if I don't stay.</p>
  <p> Picard watches Nikolai as he EXITS via the aft<br>
    Turbolift. Then the room becomes silent as everyone<br>
    stares at the Viewscreen...</p>
  <p>16 THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> shows the final moments of the planet as its last<br>
    layers of atmosphere disappear. In a few moments, it's<br>
    all over. The planet has gone from a verdant globe to<br>
    a charred, barren rock.</p>
  <p>17 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> It's an incredibly difficult moment. Beverly looks<br>
    down... Riker is deeply affected... Data's expression<br>
    is unreadable... and Picard watches the Viewscreen<br>
    unflinchingly.</p>
  <p> A silent, emotional beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, I'll be in my Ready<br>
    Room. You have the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and Picard EXITS to the Ready Room.<br>
    The mood on the Bridge slowly returns to normal.</p>

  <p> as Worf moves down the hall, scanning. He stops in<br>
    front of the entrance to a Holodeck and looks at his<br>

  <p> Worf reacts, surprised, but before he can do anything<br>
    else, the Holodeck doors suddenly OPEN. Worf peers<br>
    inside, but it's extremely dark -- he can't see a<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you doing here?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I have to show you something.<br>
    Follow me...</p>
  <p> Nikolai leads Worf down a short passage. As they walk,<br>
    Worf realizes that they are in a cave. Nikolai stops<br>
    in front of a section of the cave wall.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>

  <p> Worf still has no idea what's going on, but he nods.<br>
    Nikolai taps the PADD, and a small section of the cave<br>
    wall DISAPPEARS, leaving a hole. Nikolai motions to<br>
    the hole.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Look.</p>
  <p> Worf steps up. He peers through the hole and sees...</p>
  <p>21 THE BORAALANS - IN THE CAVERN - WORF'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is identical to the scene that Worf saw on the<br>
    planet. Everyone of the Boraalans is there, most of<br>
    them sleeping, and nothing seems out of the ordinary.</p>
  <p>22 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Worf pulls back from the hole and stares in shock at<br>
    Nikolai. Worf doesn't even have to make the<br>
    accusation.</p>

  <p>23 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Nikolai on the move. Worf is barely listening--he's<br>
    seething, so angry he can't speak. Nikolai, on<br>
    the other hand, is energized, expansive -- taking<br>
    relish in the ingeniousness of his plan.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I started thinking about this days<br>
    ago... when it became clear the<br>
    planet was doomed. I knew if I<br>
    could get access to your ship's<br>
    computer, I'd be able to generate<br>
    a replica of the caves...</p>
  <p> He glances at Worf for a response, but Worf doesn't<br>
    even look at him.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    The hard part was transporting the<br>
    Boraalans into the Holodeck<br>
    without anyone on the Enterprise<br>
    noticing. But I was able to blank<br>
    out the sensors and make it look<br>
    like interference from the<br>
    plasmonic (TECHS).</p>
  <p> They come to a halt in front of a Turbolift.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    And it worked. Perfectly. The<br>
    Boraalans were transported while<br>
    they were sleeping -- they didn't<br>
    even know anything had happened.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift door OPENS and the two go in...</p>

  <p> That's all Worf can take.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (furious)<br>
    Trust you? You never had any<br>
    intention of obeying the Captain!</p>
  <p> Nikolai doesn't back down an inch.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I wasn't going to let those people<br>
    die just because your Captain<br>
    started quoting Federation dogma<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your duty was to respect the<br>
    Captain's orders and uphold the<br>
    Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> Nikolai eyes him.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Duty. That's all that really<br>
    matters to you, isn't it?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well, I refuse to be bound by an<br>
    abstraction. The lives of the<br>
    people of Boraal are far more<br>
    important to me.</p>
  <p> Nikolai regards Worf for a moment, then smiles, claps<br>
    him on the shoulder in an attempt to break the tension<br>
    of the moment.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Worf... you worry too much. You<br>
    always did. Everything will work<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> But Worf isn't having any. He pulls away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have disgraced yourself... and<br>
    you have disgraced me. I want<br>
    nothing more to do with you.</p>

  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I know that, Captain. And I would<br>
    do it all again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you expect us to do now?<br>
    You've left us with a colony of<br>
    Boraalans who think they're still<br>
    on their planet.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I didn't beam them up here without<br>
    a plan. I've given this a lot of<br>
    thought.</p>
  <p> Nikolai begins to move around the room, excited,<br>
    persuasive...</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I believe we can find a new<br>
    planet... an M-class world...<br>
    which can become their new home.</p>
  <p> Picard is extremely skeptical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A home which would look very<br>
    different from Boraal... you can't<br>
    really believe they'd be fooled...</p>
  <p> Nikolai smiles, confident.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    That's where the Holodeck comes<br>
    in. I'll go back and tell the<br>
    Boraalans we're going on a<br>
    journey... to a different place,<br>
    where they'll be safe from the<br>
    storms. The Holodeck can change<br>
    the terrain gradually as we<br>
    travel... so that at the end, the<br>
    Holodeck simulation will match the<br>
    conditions on the new planet.<br>

  <p> It's a troubling, but intriguing notion. Picard<br>
    doesn't have many options, and he considers this one<br>
    carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What if it doesn't work? What if<br>
    they become aware that something<br>
    strange is going on?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I can't prepare for every<br>
    contingency. But I assure you --<br>
    I'm used to thinking on my feet.<br>
    I'll deal with the situation as it<br>

  <p> Picard takes a breath, comes to a decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not enthusiastic about this<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are countless M-class<br>
    planets in Federation space which<br>
    could support the Boraalans.<br>
    We'll have to narrow the<br>
    parameters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I estimate it will take<br>
    approximately nine and one half<br>
    hours to complete the analysis.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And even then there's no guarantee<br>
    we'll be able to find a suitable<br>
    planet...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    Excuse me, Captain... but I think<br>
    you better take a look at this...</p>
  <p> Beverly and Data turn their attention back to their<br>

  <p>28 GEORDI, WORF, AND NIKOLAI</p>
  <p> are studying an OKUDAGRAM which shows an intricate<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've got a problem, sir. I don't<br>

    There's no way around it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not while it's running. To fix<br>
    it, I'd have to shut down all of<br>
    the Holodecks and re-initialize<br>
    the entire system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That would take hours...</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    We'll just have to hope the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Let's try it.<br>

    any problems.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves off to join Data and Beverly, leaving<br>
    Picard alone with Nikolai and Worf. Nikolai is eager<br>
    to begin.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I'll go back to the Holodeck as<br>
    soon as my surgical alterations<br>
    are complete. I'll prepare the<br>
    Boraalans for their &quot;journey.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Considering the situation you've<br>
    put us in, I don't think it's wise<br>
    to leave you alone with those<br>
    people. Mister Worf will<br>
    accompany you.</p>
  <p> Worf is caught off guard by this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir. Perhaps someone else would<br>
    be a better choice. Counselor<br>
    Troi is familiar with --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, the Boraalans already know<br>
    you. There's no need to introduce<br>
    anyone new.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reluctant)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep a close eye on your brother.<br>
    I don't want him making the<br>
    situation any worse than it is.</p>
  <p> Picard moves off, and Worf shoots a baleful glare at<br>
    Nikolai. This is the last thing he wants to do.</p>

  <p>30 WORF AND NIKOLAI</p>
  <p> ENTER from one of the passages. Each man has a large,<br>
    heavy SACK slung over his back (NOTE: Worf and Nikolai<br>
    are back in their Boraalan make-up and costume). The<br>
    Boraalans, including Vorin, gather around, overjoyed to<br>
    see them alive.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Here... we have food...</p>
  <p> Nikolai feels very comfortable with these people, and<br>
    he's clearly happy to be back. But Worf is keeping to<br>
    himself, still wary of his role here. Nikolai<br>
    addresses the group.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My friends, this is difficult to<br>
    say... but you have the right to<br>
    know.<br>

  <p> NIKOLAI (Cont'd)<br>
    The storms had destroyed<br>
    everything. There is nothing for<br>
    us to return to.</p>
  <p> The news is devastating to the Boraal.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    We can't survive in here... our<br>
    supplies won't last forever.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    That is why we must leave. There<br>
    is a place far from here where<br>
    there are no storms. It will be<br>
    a difficult journey, but in the<br>
    end, we will have a new home...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I know a way through the caves.<br>
    We can travel safely until we<br>
    return to the surface.</p>
  <p> The words don't come easily to Worf -- he's very<br>
    uncomfortable in this role -- but it seems to satisfy<br>
    the group. However, Vorin still seems a bit<br>
    unconvinced.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Where is this new land?</p>
  <p> Worf, of course, doesn't know -- the new planet hasn't<br>
    been found yet. He tries to keep it as vague as he<br>
    can.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    As we said, it is far from here.<br>
    It will not be like the home you<br>
    knew... even the stars may be<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> It's hardly a satisfying answer, and Vorin continues to<br>
    press him.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Why would they be different? And<br>
    how do you know we'll be safe<br>
    there?</p>

  <p> Nikolai sees that Worf is floundering... and the last<br>
    thing they need is dissension here -- Nikolai has to<br>
    cover for him.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (with conviction)<br>
    Vorin. Remember -- my brother is<br>
    a Seer. If he says we'll be<br>
    safe... you can trust that we<br>
    will be.</p>
  <p> Vorin seems a little chastened, though still not<br>
    satisfied. But before he can reply, he's interrupted<br>
    by a SCREAM from across the cave.</p>
  <p>31 ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE POOL</p>
  <p> Tarrana is standing near the natural pool, obviously<br>
    terrified. A BUCKET is on the ground at her feet.</p>
  <p> Everyone rushes over to see what's happening. Kateras<br>
    goes to Tarrana and holds her.</p>
  <p> KATERAS<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> TARRANA<br>

  <p> the Holodeck grid lines appear below the surface of the<br>
    water.</p>
  <p>33 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Dobara pulls back in fear and wonder. Nikolai and Worf<br>
    exchange a look. Worf knows he has to come up with an<br>
    explanation quickly -- as well as get rid of this<br>
    Holodeck glitch. Since he's been forced into the role<br>
    of Seer, he might as well play into it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not worry... it is an omen...</p>

    It is said that when these lines<br>

  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (to group)<br>
    You see? Our journey is already<br>
    blessed. We have a long road<br>
    ahead. Let's have a meal, and<br>
    then we can make preparations to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> As the Boraalans move away, Tarrana gives Worf a little<br>
    smile -- she's clearly impressed with him.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>

    We are not a &quot;team.&quot; I am here<br>
    because Captain Picard ordered me<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Worf -- don't we share the same<br>
    goal? Aren't we both trying to<br>
    make this plan work?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Only because you forced us into<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I'm not ashamed of what I did.<br>
    I'm not sorry I saved their<br>
    lives...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have not changed. You still<br>
    expect others to solve the<br>
    problems you create.</p>
  <p> Nikolai stares at him, realizing that there is more<br>
    here than resentment over the present situation.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I'm not here to work out the<br>
    issues of our childhood. I'm<br>
    trying to save a people I care<br>
    about. And if that upsets you --<br>
    so be it.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you disagree, Doctor?</p>

    No, Data... you're right. It's<br>

  <p> Worf sits alone in a corner of the cave, fuming. As he<br>
    eats some simple food, he sees Nikolai and Dobara<br>
    preparing a meal together across the cave. They're<br>
    sitting close to each other, laughing and touching --<br>
    it all seems very intimate. The scene doesn't help<br>
    Worf's attitude at all. He tries to concentrate on his<br>
    food.</p>
  <p> Then Worf hears a light SCRATCHING SOUND. He turns to<br>
    see Vorin, sitting nearby, looking at him. Vorin has<br>
    a long SCROLL unrolled in front of him, and as he<br>
    watches Worf, he draws on the scroll with an intricate-looking<br>
    ALIEN STYLUS.</p>
  <p> Worf moves over to him, curious, and looks down at<br>
    Vorin's scroll.</p>
  <p>41 THE SCROLL</p>
  <p> is a beautifully-detailed drawing, filled with figures<br>
    and symbols and delicate alien script, similar in feel<br>

  <p> Kateras has definitely taken a shine to Worf. He leads<br>
    Worf to another spot in the cave; Worf follows<br>
    reluctantly.</p>
  <p> Worf begins to help him pack his gear, which consists<br>
    of a small BEDROLL and some BLANKETS. As they work,<br>
    Tarrana walks by, deliberately passing close to Worf.<br>

  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're friends of Nikolai and<br>
    Worf... Don't be afraid...</p>
  <p> Vorin reacts to the name.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Nikolai... ?</p>
  <p> Troi seizes on the fact that the name is something he<br>
    recognizes...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, he is my friend... and that<br>
    means you are, too. I promise I<br>
    won't hurt you...</p>
  <p> Troi's words are having an effect... Vorin makes a<br>
    tentative move toward her...</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Please... help me...</p>
  <p> He begins shaking uncontrollably.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Where am I?</p>
  <p> Troi puts her hand on Vorin's shoulder, trying to<br>
    comfort him. She and Riker exchange a worried look.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>47 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Vorin is sitting quietly on the main Sickbed. Troi is<br>
    nearby, staying close to him; an N.D. Security Guard<br>
    watches Vorin warily. Beverly and Picard are off to<br>
    one side, conferring in low tones.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry, there's nothing I can<br>
    do... his neural physiology is<br>
    unusual. I can't wipe his memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see...<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    How is he?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    As well as can be expected. I<br>
    gave him a mild sedative, and<br>
    Deanna's been talking to him the<br>
    whole time. He's calmed down a<br>
    lot.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does he understand the situation?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Get in touch with<br>
    Mister Worf... make sure he knows<br>
    what's happened.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods and EXITS. Picard moves to join Troi and<br>
    Vorin.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Vorin, isn't it?</p>
  <p> Vorin nods, eyeing Picard, unsure of his intentions.<br>
    He's on edge, still frightened and confused, unsure of<br>
    the people and surroundings in this strange place.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Why did you bring us here?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your planet was dying... it could<br>
    no longer support life. So we<br>
    took you away from it.</p>
  <p> Vorin struggles with the concept, trying to understand.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    But... we never left the caves...</p>
  <p> It's not easy to explain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 10/28/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have the ability to create<br>
    the... illusion of other places,<br>
    like the caves on your planet.<br>
    You have actually been on this<br>
    starship for the last two days...<br>
    not on Boraal.</p>
  <p> Each answer is another blow to Vorin's sense of<br>
    reality. He tries to keep himself under control as he<br>
    turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    Then our home... is gone?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Vorin is in anguish, lost -- he has no idea what to say<br>
    or do. Picard tries to give him some hope.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Vorin. Listen to me. We can<br>
    travel to many worlds. We will<br>
    take you to one where your people<br>
    can build a new life...</p>
  <p> Vorin is extremely upset by this.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    A new life... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 10/28/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Picard tries to explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A chance... for your people...<br>
    your culture... to survive and<br>
    grow.</p>
  <p> Vorin sinks back onto the Sickbed in despair.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    How can we grow when everything<br>
    that made us who we are... is<br>
    gone?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't how to respond -- Vorin's words echo his<br>
    own feelings about the Prime Directive and this entire<br>
    situation. OFF Picard's disturbed expression.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>48 EXT. HOLODECK/SURFACE - RUGGED TERRAIN - DAY</p>
  <p> The Boraalans have emerged from the caves onto barren,<br>
    rocky terrain. Everyone is loaded with gear in simple<br>
    PACKS on their backs; a couple of people are also<br>
    hauling TRAVOIS (a pair of wooden poles joined by a<br>
    strip of canvas) loaded with supplies. Nikolai is in<br>
    the lead with Dobara and several of the others.<br>
    Meanwhile, Worf is helping Kateras over a rough patch<br>
    of ground.</p>
  <p> Kateras huffs with the strain of the march. Worf takes<br>
    Kateras' pack from him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will carry this. Go join the<br>
    others...</p>
  <p> KATERAS<br>
    Thank you, Seer...</p>

  <p> As Kateras moves off, he passes Nikolai coming back to<br>
    join Worf. Nikolai watches as Kateras slowly makes his<br>
    way to the others.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    It'll be dark in a few hours...<br>
    Can you tell Mister La Forge to<br>
    create a suitable campsite for us<br>
    a few kilometers from here?</p>
  <p> Nikolai trails off as he notices Worf's angry mood.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's the matter?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Vorin has left the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    How did he get out?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't know. But Doctor Crusher<br>
    cannot erase his memory.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    What will they do with him?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They have explained the situation<br>
    to him... he must make his own<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> Nikolai looks at Worf with disbelief.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Are you saying that if Vorin wants<br>
    to come back in here... they'll<br>
    let him?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is his right. He's not a<br>
    prisoner.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    If he comes back and tells the<br>
    others what he's seen on the<br>
    Enterprise, everything we've done<br>
    will be for nothing...</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf can't take any more of this -- he explodes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You should've considered that<br>
    before you beamed them aboard!</p>
  <p> Worf glares at Nikolai, the pent-up frustrations of the<br>
    past pouring out of him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But you never think about the<br>
    consequences of your acts.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    If you mean I'm willing to do<br>
    something -- while others hesitate --<br>
    that's true.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Wherever you go, you create chaos.<br>
    How many times did our parents lie<br>
    awake at night, wondering what<br>
    kind of trouble you were in?</p>
  <p> Stung, Nikolai lashes out.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    If only I could have been more<br>
    like you -- Worf, the perfect son.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was not perfect -- but I was not<br>
    wild and disobedient.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Of course not. You were too busy<br>
    doing your duty.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would rather be accused of that --<br>
    than of making our mother weep.</p>
  <p> The two men glare at each other for a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But it is clear you have no<br>
    intention of changing. I see no<br>
    reason to discuss it further.</p>
  <p> Worf walks away in disgust, and moves to join the rest<br>
    of the group. Dobara, who is nearby, looks from one to<br>
    the other, concerned. As the group continues on its<br>
    march...</p>

  <p>49 A ROCK OUTCROPPING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> begins to SHIMMER and DISSOLVE into the Holodeck<br>
    gridlines (note: none of our characters sees this<br>
    happening). The effect only lasts a few seconds, and<br>
    the rock quickly returns to normal -- but it's clear<br>
    that the Holodeck is breaking down.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>50 EXT. HOLODECK/SURFACE - CAMP - NIGHT</p>
  <p> The Boraalans have made camp for the night. There is<br>
    a CAMPFIRE and a few simple TENTS have been pitched.<br>
    The tents are lit from within by the oil lamps, and the<br>
    shadows of the Boraalans can be seen against the tent<br>
    walls. The strains of an alien instrument can be heard<br>
    in the b.g. It's a beautiful, peaceful sight.</p>

  <p> is off by himself in a secluded spot, talking on the<br>

  <p> A short beat later, Worf sees Dobara moving toward him.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    May I speak with you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> They sit down on a couple of nearby rocks.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    I don't know what Nikolai said to<br>
    you, but please... forgive him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is an... old argument.</p>

  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    I've never seen him like this.<br>
    He's usually so confident, so sure<br>
    of himself... But now he seems...<br>
    different. Do you know why?</p>
  <p> After a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. I do not.</p>
  <p> Dobara scrutinizes him carefully, as though to search<br>
    for a deeper meaning behind his words. She proceeds<br>
    carefully.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    Ever since Vorin was lost, people<br>
    have been afraid... worried that<br>
    we won't reach our new home.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We need Nikolai's strength now...<br>

  <p> DOBARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When the storms first came to our<br>
    village, many of us were ready to<br>
    die... but Nikolai refused to let<br>
    us. He gathered us together and<br>
    led us into the caves. He saved<br>
    us.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He's a brave and compassionate<br>
    man... and I love him. Please go<br>

  <p> Vorin tries to speak with conviction, but it's clear<br>
    he's extremely uncertain.</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    I believe I would like to go back<br>

  <p> Picard reacts -- he was afraid of this, but he knows he<br>

    If you tell them the truth -- what<br>

    you?</p>
  <p> VORIN<br>
    I'm not sure. It is a fantastic<br>

    They would learn about alien<br>

    That would be disastrous. It<br>

  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I don't owe you an explanation.<br>
    It's a matter between Dobara and<br>

    the chest.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    And as usual, you're here to point<br>
    out the error of my ways.</p>
  <p> Worf gives Nikolai a shove right back.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have treated Dobara with<br>
    dishonor.</p>
  <p> Nikolai shoves Worf -- harder.</p>

    You will have to kill me first --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, there is a huge CRACKLING SOUND from the sky.<br>
    Worf and Nikolai look up...</p>
  <p>58 THE SKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is beginning to shimmer, dissolving into gridlines and<br>
    then reforming... it's a spectacular and terrifying<br>
    sight (NOTE: the Holodeck simulation is completely<br>
    falling apart here and the precise optical effects<br>
    should reflect that).</p>
  <p>59 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Nikolai and Worf exchange a look -- what are they going<br>
    to do? At that moment, Dobara, Kateras, and several of<br>

    they're doomed.</p>
  <p> KATERAS<br>

    The storm is getting worse! You<br>
    must go to your tents -- now!</p>
  <p> As the storm worsens, the Boraalans scramble madly into<br>
    their tents... In a few moments, everyone is inside,<br>
    leaving Worf and Nikolai alone in the middle of the<br>
    camp...</p>
  <p>62 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's a bizarre scene as the wind howls and lightning<br>
    crackles. Worf and Nikolai check one last time, making<br>
    certain that everyone is inside, and then...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Commander... Energize...</p>
  <p> Worf, Nikolai and the tents DEMATERIALIZE...</p>
  <p>63 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as everything MATERIALIZES in the same position and in<br>
    what appears to be the same place -- except now it is<br>
    a calm and peaceful night. (NOTE: this is now supposed<br>
    to be the actual surface of the planet; it may be<br>
    appropriate to make minor changes to the set such as<br>
    placing various rocks in different places, etc.)</p>
  <p> A few moments pass and then the Boraalans slowly emerge<br>
    from their tents. They stare all around in wonder.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The storms will not return.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    What did I tell you? My brother<br>
    has saved us.</p>
  <p> They look at Worf with awe and gratitude. Worf and<br>
    Nikolai exchange a meaningful look -- they pulled<br>
    together and it worked.</p>
  <p>64 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Vacca Six.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47427.2.<br>
    The Boraalans have safely reached<br>
    the site of what will eventually<br>
    become their new village. None of<br>
    them suspects they ever left their<br>
    planet. However, our success has<br>
    come at a high price...</p>
  <p>65 INT. VORIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Vorin lies dead on his bed. Picard watches grimly as<br>
    Beverly pulls the sheet up over his face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think it was some form of ritual<br>
    suicide...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 11/01/93 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He said he had nowhere to go...</p>
  <p> It's a solemn moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He'd have died even if we hadn't<br>
    interfered...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But he wouldn't have died alone...<br>
    and afraid...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you saying you're sorry we<br>
    saved the Boraalans?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, of course not. Our plan<br>
    worked out well for them...</p>
  <p> He glances down at the still form.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But I wish Vorin could have<br>
    bridged the gap between our<br>
    cultures. I would have liked the<br>
    chance to know him better.</p>
  <p> Beverly has no comment. Off their expressions...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>66 OMITTED</p>
  <p>67 EXT. SURFACE - DAY</p>
  <p> Nikolai stands near their tent with Dobara as Worf<br>
    approaches. Dobara looks at Worf a bit fearfully,<br>
    uncertain if the two are going to fight again.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Dobara... go inside.</p>
  <p> DOBARA<br>
    Nikolai -- don't...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 11/01/93 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> She gives Worf a last look and then enters the tent.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I told you -- you'll have to kill<br>
    me to get me away from here.</p>
  <p> Worf regards his brother for a long beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't want to fight you,<br>
    Nikolai.</p>
  <p> These are two men trying to reach each other, trying to<br>
    find the way out of conflict and into resolution.<br>
    Nikolai takes a breath, tries to cut through.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Nothing was ever easy between us,<br>
    was it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Nikolai is trying to set things right between them --<br>
    even if it means making difficult admissions.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    It's my fault. If I'd been more<br>
    like you, we wouldn't have had so<br>
    many problems.</p>
  <p> Worf is touched by the gesture.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you'd been more like me --<br>
    those people would not be here<br>
    now. You gave them a chance at a<br>
    new life.</p>
  <p> Nikolai regards him... takes the next step.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - REV. 11/01/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    Worf... I intend to share that<br>
    life with them. The village will<br>
    need someone to begin a new<br>
    chronicle... and my child will<br>
    need a father. My place is here.<br>
    (beat: a small smile)<br>
    Don't you see? I'm finally taking<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, then smiles as well.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were never good at drawing...<br>
    how will you keep a chronicle?</p>
  <p> Nikolai smiles -- they've reached a resolution.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    I learn quickly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then perhaps there is hope...</p>
  <p> Worf moves closer to Nikolai and picks up Vorin's pouch<br>
    of scrolls which lies nearby. He searches through the<br>
    pouch for a beat and then finds the one he was looking<br>
    for. Worf unrolls it -- it's the drawing Vorin made of<br>
    Worf and Nikolai.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    May I take this with me?</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    It's yours.</p>
  <p> A long beat as the two brothers share the personal<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will attempt to explain all this<br>
    to mother and father.</p>
  <p> NIKOLAI<br>
    They won't understand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They may. I will tell them... you<br>
    are happy.</p>
  <p> OFF their expressions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Homeward&quot; - 10/27/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>68 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it leaves the planet behind.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
