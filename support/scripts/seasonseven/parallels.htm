  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse.</p>
  <p>2 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> WORF is alone in the shuttle, shining his BAT'LETH<br>
    SWORD with a cloth. He eyes the sword with<br>
    satisfaction, then sets it down and moves to the helm.<br>
    He taps a control. (NOTE: He faces the console, as<br>
    though looking into a &quot;camera&quot;.)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Personal log, Stardate 47391.2.<br>
    I am returning from the Bat'leth<br>
    competition on Forcas Three. The<br>
    conditions were difficult...<br>
    several contenders were maimed.<br>
    But I was triumphant...</p>
  <p> Worf picks up a large KLINGON TROPHY -- an impressive-looking<br>
    award with distinctive Klingon markings on it.<br>
    He eyes it proudly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I won &quot;Champion Standing.&quot;</p>
  <p> His expression turns serious.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I look forward to resuming my<br>
    duties aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    However, I am anticipating a...<br>
    troubling situation.</p>
  <p> OFF his concerned face...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Later. Worf and RIKER are walking along, midconversation.<br>
    Worf is carrying his Bat'leth sword and<br>
    trophy. He keeps looking around, nervous -- he seems<br>
    preoccupied by something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It looks like we're going to have<br>
    to head out to the Argus Array.<br>
    This is the third time in the last<br>
    year it's stopped relaying data.<br>
    Starfleet's beginning to think it<br>
    may be more than a simple<br>
    malfunction.</p>
  <p> As they turn a corner, Worf hesitates, as though<br>
    expecting an attack.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want you to start a long range<br>
    scan as soon as we enter the --</p>
  <p> Riker takes note of Worf's jumpiness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you listening to me,<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Oh... yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You seem pretty tense for a man<br>
    who just came back from vacation.</p>
  <p> They stop at Worf's quarters. Worf very cautiously<br>
    touches a control by the door...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Today... is my birthday.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Worf opens the door and bursts into the room --</p>
  <p>4 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Worf rushes in, looks around, ready for anything. No<br>
    one's there. He seems relieved. Riker looks at him a<br>
    bit oddly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's the matter with you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Because it is my birthday... I<br>
    assumed that you or one of the<br>
    others would try to mount an<br>
    unexpected... social gathering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You mean a surprise party? Worf,<br>
    I hate surprise parties. I would<br>
    never do that to you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... sorry, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why don't you settle in and I'll<br>
    meet you on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Worf takes a breath, relaxing... he sets<br>
    down his Bat'leth and sets his trophy proudly on a<br>
    table. He heads for the bedroom, starts to take off<br>
    his sash, gets about half-way there when suddenly --</p>
  <p> VOICES<br>
    SURPRISE!!</p>
  <p> Worf LEAPS back, as if scalded --</p>
  <p>5 REVEAL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TROI, BEVERLY, GEORDI, DATA and SEVERAL N.D.S as they<br>
    rush out of the bedroom. Many hold birthday GIFTS --<br>
    others have party favors, noise-makers. It's the most<br>
    human and obnoxious party you can imagine. They come<br>
    up shaking his hand, offering birthday wishes, patting<br>
    him on the back. Troi and Beverly kiss him on the<br>
    cheek. Riker ENTERS during the middle of all this,<br>
    comes up behind Worf with huge smile on his face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually, Worf, I love surprise<br>
    parties.</p>
  <p> Riker then puts a big, ridiculous PARTY HAT on Worf's<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A few minutes later. Beverly is holding a large<br>
    CHOCOLATE CAKE, which has many burning CANDLES on it.<br>
    Everyone is singing the &quot;For He's A Jolly Good Fellow&quot;,<br>
    but with Klingon lyrics. Worf stands there awkwardly --<br>
    this is like torture for him.</p>
  <p> ALL<br>
    (sung to the tune of<br>
    &quot;For He's A Jolly Good<br>
    Fellow&quot;)<br>
    &quot;Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah lo<br>
    Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah<br>
    lo Pre'tOk... Cha Worf Toh'gah-nah<br>
    lo Pre'tO-O-O-O-Ok... Tu Mak<br>
    Dagh Cha doh Borak!&quot;</p>
  <p> As they finish the song, Beverly holds out the cake to<br>
    Worf, who quickly blows out the candles. Everyone<br>
    applauds. Worf can barely conceal his disgust.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That was not a Klingon song.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It wasn't easy to translate.<br>
    There doesn't seem to be a Klingon<br>
    word for &quot;jolly&quot;.</p>
  <p> Beverly hands Worf a knife.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's traditional for the birthday<br>
    boy to cut the cake.</p>
  <p> Worf takes the knife and eyes it a moment -- other uses<br>
    for it cross his mind. Then he cuts the cake with two<br>
    quicks WHACKS and serves a piece to a Crewmember.<br>
    (NOTE: The cake is chocolate inside, as well.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The party proceeds merrily, with Beverly moving off to<br>
    cut the rest of the cake, people getting drinks, etc.<br>
    Riker claps a friendly hand on Worf's shoulder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain Picard sends his birthday<br>
    wishes. He was needed on the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> Riker moves off to get some cake. Data walks over<br>
    holding a large GIFT. He hands it to Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Happy birthday, Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf takes the gift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you....</p>
  <p> Worf tears the wrapping paper off the gift, revealing<br>
    a large PAINTING -- a great deal of conflicting colors<br>
    and shapes. It is difficult to tell which side is up.<br>
    Worf eyes it...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ah... a painting.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. I have entered my Abstract<br>
    Expressionistic phase. This is my<br>
    interpretation of the Battle of<br>
    HarOS.</p>
  <p> Worf examines the painting, hunting for any<br>
    recognizable image.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Battle of HarOS... ?</p>
  <p> Troi takes the painting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think it's wonderful. And I<br>
    know just where to hang it...</p>
  <p> She moves to a spot on the wall.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I always thought this room could<br>
    use a little more color.</p>
  <p> Troi hangs the painting and steps back. Geordi comes<br>
    over to admire the painting, carrying two pieces of<br>
    cake.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: painting)<br>
    Battle of HarOS, right?</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him in amazement. Geordi hands a piece<br>
    of cake to Worf. The interior of the cake is now<br>
    YELLOW, not chocolate as seen before. (NOTE: Minor<br>
    continuity changes of this sort will be indicated<br>
    throughout the script.)</p>
  <p> As Worf takes the cake, he reacts to a mild wave of<br>
    dizziness.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You alright?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe Commander Data's<br>
    painting is making me dizzy...</p>
  <p> Laughter all around. Worf takes a bite of his cake,<br>
    looks down at it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (casual)<br>
    I thought this cake was<br>
    chocolate...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't I wish.</p>
  <p> Troi hands Worf a small GIFT. (NOTE: Troi is dressed<br>
    in one of her casual outfits, and her hair is in a<br>
    looser, more casual style.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (re: gift)<br>
    This is from Alexander. He gave<br>
    it to me before he left to visit<br>
    your parents.</p>
  <p> Worf sets down the cake and takes the gift... carefully<br>
    unwraps it. We see that it is a round piece of CLAY,<br>
    with the imprint of Alexander's forehead ridges on it<br>
    (the Klingon equivalent of a child's hand-print). Worf<br>
    smiles at the sight.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Alexander's forehead.<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    The ridges of a warrior.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He really wished he could've been<br>
    here when you got back from shore<br>
    leave. You should have seen him,<br>
    Worf... he stayed up all night<br>
    talking about how proud he was of<br>
    his father.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you for watching him while<br>
    I was away.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was my pleasure.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her, and he gets a thoughtful look on is<br>
    face... clearly concerned about something...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, we hear PICARD'S voice from offcamera --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... how old are you, Mister<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf turns in surprise.</p>
  <p>7 REVEAL PICARD</p>
  <p> standing behind Worf. Worf didn't see the Captain come<br>
    in -- and neither did we.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- I was told you couldn't<br>
    attend.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wouldn't miss this for the<br>
    world. How old are you?</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, awkward about his age.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... old enough.</p>
  <p> Everyone laughs. Worf bristles. As the party<br>
    continues...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Holding position next to the ARGUS ARRAY -- a huge<br>
    subspace radio telescope (as seen in &quot;The Nth Degree&quot;).</p>
  <p>9 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, N.D.s at their stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The Array appears to be<br>
    functioning normally, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Reactions -- this isn't what they expected.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That can't be right. We were told<br>
    it stopped relaying data six days<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Array is still transmitting<br>
    data. However, it is no longer<br>
    sending that information to the<br>
    Federation.<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It appears that someone has<br>
    redirected its imaging systems.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is the information being<br>
    sent now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works)<br>
    Sector One-nine-six-five-eight.<br>
    I am unable to access the Array's<br>
    main computer, so it is impossible<br>
    to determine the exact location.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's in that sector?</p>
  <p> Worf works.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is uninhabited. But there<br>
    could easily be a ship, or a<br>
    subspace relay station receiving<br>
    the data.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain. I suggest we beam a<br>
    repair crew aboard the Array. We<br>
    can download the imaging logs --<br>
    find out what the Array's been<br>
    observing for the past six days.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker nods to Data and they both head for the door.<br>
    OFF Picard's concern...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Troi is sitting alone at a table, working on a PADD<br>
    (she's in her uniform and her hair is in a less<br>
    elaborate, more formal style). Worf walks up to the<br>
    table, eyes Troi a moment, thoughtful... then<br>
    approaches the table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me, Counselor. Do you have<br>
    a moment?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Worf sits at the table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have been meaning to speak with<br>
    you... about Alexander.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, tries to find the best way to put this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It has never been easy for me...<br>
    having Alexander on board. I have<br>
    always tried to be a good<br>
    father... to give him guidance...<br>
    but he seems to have his own mind<br>
    about some things.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Most children do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I could not have gotten this far<br>
    without your help. Alexander<br>
    looks up to you. At times, I have<br>
    felt that you are like a mother to<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> Troi is touched by his words.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... that's one of the nicest<br>
    things anyone's ever said to me.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Once, when I thought I was going<br>
    to die... I asked you to watch<br>
    over Alexander. I was<br>
    wondering... if you might consider<br>
    formalizing that arrangement.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I want you to be Alexander's SohchIm.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    His &quot;Soh-chIm&quot;?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You would become his surrogate<br>
    mother. In case anything ever<br>
    happened to me, you would be<br>
    responsible for him.</p>
  <p> Troi is surprised by the request... and flattered.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, I don't know what to say.<br>
    It's a great honor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So this would make me your...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The closest analogy would be...<br>
    step-sister.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That would make my mother your<br>

    It is a risk I am willing to take.</p>

    Someone is using the Array for<br>
    covert surveillance of the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is our theory. We believe<br>
    that unauthorized access was made<br>
    six days ago. The imaging logs<br>
    from that day show a ship<br>
    approaching the Array...</p>
  <p> Data works the console and the monitor displays the<br>
    grainy but unmistakable image of a CARDASSIAN WARSHIP.<br>
    Reactions.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That's a Cardassian ship. Galor<br>
    Class.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We're only three light years from<br>
    Cardassian space. They would've<br>
    had easy access to the Array.</p>
  <p> Picard considers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, start a long range<br>
    scan of the region... see if there<br>
    are any Cardassian ships nearby.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye sir.</p>

    Are you alright, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> Worf opens his eyes --</p>

  <p> Data and Geordi are now both standing on the opposite<br>
    side of the room, working at a console. Picard is<br>
    nowhere to be seen. It's an odd moment -- as though in<br>
    the blink of an eye, everyone changed positions. Worf<br>
    reacts, confused.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I feel... dizzy...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Worf, you don't look so good.<br>
    Maybe you should go to Sickbay...</p>
  <p> Worf nods, recovering slightly.</p>

    Any nausea... or blurred vision?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. However, I did experience<br>
    dizziness earlier today... at my<br>
    birthday celebration.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods and shuts the tricorder. She picks up a<br>
    nearby hypospray and prepares it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (casually)<br>
    It sounds like you're having a few<br>
    side-effects from the concussion.<br>
    I'll give you vertazine for the<br>
    dizziness... but I want you to get<br>
    some rest.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to inject worf with the hypospray, but he<br>
    stops her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor... perhaps you are thinking<br>
    of another patient. I have no<br>
    concussion.</p>
  <p> There's an awkward beat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf... you came in here this<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Temporary memory loss is common<br>
    with this kind of injury...<br>

    Do you remember telling me about<br>
    the Bat'leth tournament? You said<br>
    one of the competitors hit you in<br>
    the head... that's why you lost<br>
    the match...</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to this, disturbed -- he steps off the<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I won that tournament. I can<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf, try to calm down. Memory<br>

  <p> He suddenly remembers something.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The log... I recorded a personal<br>
    log on my way back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Worf sits down at his desk, taps a command into a<br>
    desktop monitor. Beverly watches with concern.</p>

    standing.</p>
  <p> The Worf on the monitor reaches offscreen and picks up<br>
    a Klingon trophy -- it is the smaller, less impressive<br>
    one that we see now in Worf's quarters.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure this must be very<br>

    The best thing you can do right<br>
    now is settle back into your<br>

    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the Starship Enterprise. You are<br>
    in Federation territory. Please<br>
    explain your presence here.</p>
  <p> GUL NADOR<br>
    We were wondering the same thing<br>
    about you, Captain. Why would<br>
    Starfleet's flagship want to<br>
    venture so close to the Cardassian<br>
    border?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are repairing one of our<br>

  <p> Gul Nador eyes Picard.</p>
  <p> GUL NADOR<br>
    If you don't mind my asking...<br>
    what exactly is this telescope of<br>
    yours designed to do?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's a long range subspace<br>
    Array... it gathers data on<br>
    astronomical phenomena.</p>
  <p> GUL NADOR<br>
    I'm certain it would never be used<br>
    to... &quot;observe&quot; a neighboring<br>

  <p> Picard turns to Worf, grim-faced.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened back there,<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates... glances around the Bridge... everyone<br>
    looking at him, waiting for a response.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I believe I had another... memory<br>
    loss.</p>
  <p> They stare at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Memory loss&quot;... What are you<br>
    talking about?</p>
  <p> Worf realizes -- they have no idea what he's talking<br>
    about. Worf takes a beat... then makes the decision<br>
    not to say anything further.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not feel well, Captain.<br>
    Request to be temporarily relieved<br>
    of duty.</p>

  <p> Worf ENTERS -- he's agitated, determined to find out<br>
    what's happening to him. He stops by the wall where<br>
    the painting of the Klingon Battlecruiser is still<br>
    hanging. He stares at for a long moment... then<br>
    glances around the room... sees something and crosses<br>
    to the table where the trophy was sitting earlier. It<br>
    is gone -- and there is now a vase of FLOWERS on the<br>
    table, along with several exotic-looking pieces of ART.</p>

  <p> WORF ON MONITOR<br>

    As a result, I will not be able to<br>
    compete in the Bat'leth tournament<br>

    brother to take my place. He does<br>
    not have my prowess with the<br>
    blade, but --</p>
  <p> Worf taps a control and the log ENDS. This is getting<br>
    stranger by the minute. The door CHIMES. Worf jumps<br>
    up at the sound, startled. He stands and walks to the<br>
    door, taps a control. The doors slide open to reveal<br>
    Troi. She ENTERS. (Troi is back into her casual<br>
    clothing and hair.)</p>

    Why shouldn't I?</p>
  <p> Troi looks at Worf with concern.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I heard about what happened on the<br>
    Bridge. Are you all right?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not sure...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you want to talk about it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would rather not, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Hot chocolate.</p>
  <p> We HEAR the cup materialize. Worf looks at her, a<br>
    little confused. She seems to be making herself quite<br>
    at home.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is there something I can do for<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> Troi turns to him, taking a sip.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually, there is...</p>
  <p> Troi moves to the bedroom. At this point we should see<br>
    that the bedroom is slightly different than normal.<br>
    Besides Worf's usual Klingon paraphernalia, there are<br>
    some items that can usually be seen in Troi's quarters<br>
    (TBD).</p>

  <p> Troi sits down on the bed and pats a spot next to her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I want you to sit down. Relax for<br>
    a minute.</p>
  <p> Worf sits. Troi very calmly and very naturally reaches<br>
    over and turns Worf away from her slightly... and she<br>
    removes the band that keeps Worf's hair in a pony-tail.<br>
    She starts stroking his hair gently. Worf stiffens,<br>
    uncomfortable with the intimate gesture.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're really tense.</p>
  <p> She begins to massage his shoulders, soothing him,<br>
    comforting. Worf is growing increasingly uneasy with<br>
    the closeness.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... I know you don't want to<br>
    talk about what happened on the<br>
    Bridge... but there are times when<br>
    it's best to open up...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Come on... if you can't talk to<br>
    me, who can you talk to?</p>
  <p> She reaches around and bites Worf playfully on the ear.<br>
    Worf leaps to his feet, alarmed.</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not believe this is<br>
    appropriate behavior!</p>
  <p> Troi eyes him, a little confused.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not even for your wife?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Wife!</p>
  <p> Worf is stunned beyond belief. He takes a couple of<br>
    steps backward. Troi sees and senses that Worf is<br>
    genuinely confused and troubled. Something is wrong.<br>
    She stands.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf, what's wrong?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not know... things are...<br>
    changing...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's changed?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not remember us... you and<br>

    It is as if events...<br>
    circumstances... continue to<br>
    change from moment to moment...<br>
    but I am the only one who seems to<br>
    be aware of it...</p>
  <p> Troi tries to make sense of this...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So... are you saying you don't<br>
    remember the last three years?<br>
    You don't remember us falling in<br>
    love... and getting married?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do remember the last three<br>
    years... but they are different.<br>
    We did not have this relationship.<br>
    We were friends. The Enterprise<br>
    did not have a battle with the<br>
    Cardassians...</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Worf sits down heavily, very disturbed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No one believes me.</p>
  <p> Troi considers him for a moment. As bizarre as his<br>
    behavior is, the Troi in this reality loves him deeply.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... whatever's wrong...<br>
    whatever's happened... I want you<br>
    to know that I believe you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And that I love you. We'll find<br>
    out what's happening...</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her, touched by the depth of feeling.<br>
    And he nods, gratified to have someone on his side...</p>

  <p> Later. Data and Worf are working at a console as Troi<br>
    looks on. (NOTE: Data's EYES are not gold -- they are<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I remember that... A cargo<br>
    container fell on me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. After that, I<br>
    observed that you and the<br>
    Counselor began to spend more time<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When did it become... romantic?</p>

    You felt that to do otherwise<br>

    Perhaps we should try to pinpoint<br>

    became discontinuous. Do you<br>
    remember the first change?</p>
  <p> Worf thinks.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I went to Sickbay. Doctor Crusher<br>
    told me I had a concussion... but<br>
    I do not remember that happening.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Think back. Are you sure that was<br>
    the very first change? Perhaps<br>
    there was one before you entered<br>
    Sickbay?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Before...</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly remembers --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... yes. In Engineering. I<br>
    felt a wave of dizziness... and<br>

    BURN MARKS are visible on his face. He's not wearing<br>

    a medical tricorder and begins to scan Geordi's body.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> Riker looks at Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But he's standing right here in<br>
    front of us. He's been on the<br>
    ship for seven years.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot explain that either.<br>
    According to my understanding of<br>
    physics, Worf should not exist.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Riker considers this strange theory. He<br>
    looks to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    You say these discontinuities<br>
    started to occur after you<br>
    returned from a Bat'leth<br>
    tournament on Forcas Three.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now, I know for a fact that you<br>
    didn't attend that tournament...<br>
    and that no shuttlecraft has left<br>
    the Enterprise for over a month.</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand. But I also clearly<br>
    remember attending the tournament,<br>
    and returning to the ship in a<br>
    shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you remember the course you<br>
    took to return to the ship?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I think so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's backtrack that course... see<br>
    if there are any unusual readings<br>
    or anomalies.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Worf goes to the door but stops... then<br>
    turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If I may inquire, sir... how long<br>
    have you been Captain?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Four years. Ever since Captain<br>
    Picard was killed during an<br>
    incident with the Borg.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You don't remember any of this, do<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do remember. I just remember it<br>
    differently.</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's uneasy expression...</p>

  <p> Riker, Data and N.D.s at stations. Worf is at command.<br>
    WESLEY CRUSHER is working Tactical, wearing a gold<br>

    The anomaly cannot be seen.<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is it dangerous?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at this distance, sir.<br>
    (works)<br>
    I am also detecting an ion trail<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I have an explanation, sir.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>44 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A short time later. Riker, Worf, Troi, Beverly,<br>
    Wesley. Data is reporting to the group.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe the quantum fissure we<br>
    discovered is a fixed point across<br>
    the space-time continuum -- a<br>
    &quot;keyhole&quot; that intersects many<br>
    different quantum realities.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What do you mean by &quot;quantum<br>
    realities&quot;?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For any event, there is an<br>
    infinite number of possible<br>
    outcomes. Our choices determine<br>
    which outcome will follow. But<br>
    there is a theory in quantum<br>
    physics that all possibilities<br>
    that could happen do happen in<br>
    alternate quantum realities.</p>
  <p> Data indicates Riker, who is sitting at the head of the<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For instance, in a different<br>
    quantum reality, Captain Riker may<br>
    have chosen to sit at the other<br>
    end of the table. While in<br>
    another reality, the Captain may<br>
    be standing.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (onto idea)<br>
    So at this moment, there are an<br>
    infinite number of Enterprises...<br>
    and an infinite number of Doctor<br>
    Crushers having this discussion.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - REV. 10/07/93 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Although on some of those<br>
    Enterprises, there may not be a<br>
    Doctor Crusher...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And somehow I have been shifting<br>
    from one reality to another...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts -- finally, he's been vindicated.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How did this happen?</p>
  <p> Data moves to the wall monitor and taps a control. The<br>
    MONITOR DISPLAYS a GRAPHIC that shows a SINGLE POINT at<br>
    the center of the screen, representing the quantum<br>
    fissure. A SINGLE LINE representing Worf's<br>
    shuttlecraft begins moving toward the fissure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off graphic)<br>
    When Worf's shuttlecraft made<br>
    contact with the quantum fissure,<br>
    I believe its warp engines caused<br>
    a small break in the barriers<br>
    between quantum realties.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Worf was thrown into a state of<br>
    quantum flux.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> As the single line makes CONTACT with the fissure, the<br>
    line suddenly BRANCHES OUT into DOZENS of different<br>
    LINES, like a complex tree-branch.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He immediately began to shift to<br>
    other realities.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (onto idea)<br>
    And Geordi's VISOR somehow<br>
    triggered that...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly. The VISOR uses a<br>
    subspace field pulse. I think<br>
    that whenever Geordi came near<br>
    Worf, the field pulse intensified<br>
    the quantum flux and pushed Worf<br>
    into another reality.</p>
  <p> They consider this bizarre concept.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How can we find my original<br>
    quantum state... and return me to<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> A tense beat. Wesley gets an idea.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data... what if we scanned the<br>
    quantum fissure using a subspace<br>
    differential pulse? Maybe we<br>
    could locate the quantum state<br>
    that shares Worf's signature...<br>
    and find a way to get him back.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An excellent idea, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Riker considers, then --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> As everyone stands and heads for the door...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>45 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The room is decorated the way it was in Act Three,<br>
    except for one minor detail -- the painting is hanging<br>
    back on the wall where it was in Act One, and it is the<br>
    Impressionistic painting again. Worf and Troi ENTER<br>
    together. Worf is agitated.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> Troi tries to find the best way to put this -- it's<br>
    difficult. She is feeling vulnerable in a way we've<br>
    never seen before. She's at a loss of what to do...<br>
    and she needs her husband to help her through this...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    From what I understand, there's a<br>
    good chance that my Worf won't<br>
    return...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I guess it's just hard for me<br>
    to accept that there's a reality<br>
    out there where you never loved<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> Worf is moved by her words. He cares about this<br>
    woman... and he has a great deal of affection for her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deanna... I have always considered<br>
    you a close friend.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF (Cont'd)<br>
    And although I have never<br>
    seriously considered a romantic<br>
    relationship... I am not opposed<br>
    to the possibility...</p>
  <p> Troi looks at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And what about our children?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Children...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You didn't know?</p>
  <p> Worf looks disturbed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When the last shift occurred in<br>
    Sickbay, we did not have<br>
    children...</p>
  <p> He sits down heavily -- he wasn't prepared for this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We have a little girl... Shannara.<br>
    She's two years-old. And we have<br>
    a three year-old boy. Eric-Christopher.</p>
  <p> Worf takes this in, then realizes...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What about Alexander?</p>
  <p> She looks at him blankly.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Alexander?</p>
  <p> And it's clear -- in this reality, Alexander does not<br>
    exist.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He was my son... in another<br>
    reality.</p>
  <p> A beat as they absorb this strange and disturbing<br>
    situation. And finally, there are no words to describe<br>
    what they're feeling. Slowly, impulsively, Troi moves<br>
    into Worf's arms.</p>

    Data -- can we stop these<br>
    incursions?</p>
  <p> Data quickly thinks -- then looks at Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps -- if we find the ship<br>
    which matches Commander Worf's<br>
    quantum signature.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How would that help?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was Worf's shuttlecraft which<br>
    traversed the fissure and weakened<br>
    the barriers between quantum<br>
    realities. If he re-enters the<br>
    fissure in his original shuttle,<br>
    and emits a broad-spectrum warp<br>
    field -- it may be enough to seal<br>
    the fissure and stop additional<br>
    realities from emerging into our<br>
    own.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what? How do we get the<br>
    Enterprises that are already here<br>
    back to where they belong?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In theory, the act of sealing the<br>
    fissure should also restore the<br>
    barriers between quantum states.<br>

    think we have a way to return all<br>
    of us to our proper realities. We<br>

    (to Worf)<br>
    I have re-modulated the shuttle's<br>

    the field at the precise moment<br>
    you enter the fissure.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Assuming it works... what will<br>
    happen? Will I find myself near<br>
    my own ship?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is one possibility. However,<br>
    the uncertainty principle dictates<br>
    that time is a variable in this<br>

    No sir -- it's one of the<br>
    Enterprises.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They're hailing us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> On the Viewscreen, we see another CAPTAIN RIKER<br>
    standing on the Bridge of another Enterprise. He looks<br>
    haggard, terrified about something. Worf can be seen<br>
    behind him -- he also looks urgent. The ship is DARK,<br>
    smokey, lit only by emergency lighting. A panel<br>
    explodes in the b.g.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - REV. 10/08/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER ON VIEWSCREEN<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    We won't go back! You don't know<br>
    what it's like in our universe.<br>
    The Federation is gone -- the Borg<br>
    are everywhere! We're one of the<br>
    last ships left! Please, you've<br>
    got to help us!</p>
  <p> A difficult moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry. There's no choice. If<br>
    this works, everything will return<br>
    to --</p>
  <p> RIKER ON VIEWSCREEN<br>
    No! We won't go!</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    They're firing on the shuttle!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Open fire! Try to disable them!</p>
  <p> Wesley works...</p>
  <p>58 EXT. SPACE - THE TWO ENTERPRISES (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> One of the ships FIRES TORPEDOES on the other.</p>
  <p>59 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Direct hit... their shields have<br>
    collapsed... their engine core's<br>
    overloading --</p>
  <p> On the Viewscreen, the other Enterprise EXPLODES in a<br>
    blast of fiery debris -- completely destroyed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (off console)<br>
    It looks like their ship had<br>
    already taken heavy damage --<br>
    their warp containment field must<br>
    have been weak.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Probably from fighting the Borg...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain -- Worf is entering the<br>
    fissure.</p>
  <p>60 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. But now we can see the QUANTUM FISSURE<br>
    through the windows as the shuttle gets closer...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Charging primary systems...<br>
    initiating inverse warp field...</p>
  <p> Worf taps a control. The shuttle starts to TREMBLE...</p>
  <p>61 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As DOZENS of WORFS APPEAR, all identical but moving<br>
    slightly out of synch with one another -- like an<br>
    &quot;infinity mirror&quot; of Worfs moving together...</p>
  <p> The SCREEN WASHES OUT IN A FLASH OF COLOR --</p>
  <p>62 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> Worf is lying on the floor, unconscious. His eyes<br>
    flicker open... and he sits up and glances around. He<br>
    rushes to helm, looks out the windows... sees nothing<br>
    but stars...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>63 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprises are gone -- the shuttle sits alone in<br>
    space.</p>
  <p>64 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> Worf taps a control.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Worf to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- is everything alright?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant. Is there a<br>
    problem?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not believe so. But I will<br>
    explain when I arrive.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    How was the Bat'leth tournament?</p>
  <p> Worf glances around the shuttle, sees the large Klingon<br>
    trophy from the Teaser sitting nearby. He grabs it and<br>
    eyes it with relief.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I won... &quot;Champion Standing.&quot;</p>
  <p>65 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>66 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker are walking along, mid-conversation.<br>
    Worf is carrying his Bat'leth sword and trophy, as seen<br>
    in the Teaser.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So you don't think this... quantum<br>
    fissure is anything we have to<br>
    worry about?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. I believe the inverse warp<br>
    field resealed it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I look forward to reading your<br>
    report.</p>
  <p> They stop at Worf's quarters. Worf eyes the door<br>
    warily -- he knows what's coming.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something wrong?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I know what you are planning.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    I will not be surprised.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Surprised? I don't know what<br>
    you're talking about.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Of course you don't.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him, puzzled. Worf touches a control<br>
    and the doors open...</p>
  <p>67 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS and glances around. No one's there. He<br>
    sets down his trophy and sword and heads to the<br>
    bedroom... pauses by the door expectantly, then bursts<br>
    into the room --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE 65.</p>
  <p>68 NEW ANGLE - BEDROOM</p>
  <p> The room is empty except for Troi, who is standing by<br>
    a small terrarium. She looks up, a little startled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... welcome home.</p>
  <p> She smiles. Worf eyes her with concern -- and for a<br>
    terrible moment it looks like they might still be<br>
    married. Troi indicates the terrarium.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I hope you don't mind I let myself<br>
    in. I promised Alexander I'd feed<br>
    his Dalvin hissing beetle while<br>
    you were both away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So... you do not live here?</p>
  <p> She looks at him in surprise.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is that supposed to mean?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a... long story.</p>
  <p> She hands him a small GIFT.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Happy birthday.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Wil wanted to give you a surprise<br>
    party, but I knew you'd hate it...<br>
    so I talked him out of it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> There's an awkward beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... I know Klingons like to be<br>
    alone on their birthdays.<br>
    (with humor)<br>
    I'm sure you have to meditate, or<br>
    hit yourself with a pain stick or<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Parallels&quot; - 10/07/93 - ACT FIVE 66.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She turns to go...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Deanna... you do not have to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have not had dinner. Would you<br>
    care to... join me?</p>
  <p> Troi is touched, and a little surprised.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd love to.</p>
  <p> Worf smiles at her and indicates a chair. Troi sits<br>
    down. As Worf moves to the replicator and the two<br>
    friends prepare for dinner...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
