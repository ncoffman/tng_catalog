    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. CLASSROOM</p>
  <p> TROI and an N.D. TEACHER are supervising an art class.<br>
    SEVERAL N.D. STUDENTS, roughly junior high-school age,<br>
    are making CLAY SCULPTURES. Troi is here as a kind of<br>
    &quot;guest-lecturer&quot;, and DATA is here as well, working on<br>
    a sculpture of his own.</p>
  <p> Troi is standing with a twelve year old student, ERIC,<br>
    who's working his clay into a shape vaguely<br>
    recognizable as some kind of animal. Troi inspects his<br>
    work, not exactly sure what it's supposed to be.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (encouraging)<br>
    That's very nice.</p>
  <p> Eric stops working and looks unhappily at his<br>
    sculpture.</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    No, it isn't. I just can't get it<br>
    right. Do you think the wings are<br>
    too big?</p>
  <p> She now realizes what he's trying to make.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not at all... birds have wings of<br>
    all sizes, Eric. But you<br>
    shouldn't worry about making it<br>
    look perfect.</p>
  <p> Eric indicates the N.D. Teacher who's working with one<br>
    of the other students in the background.</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    But Mrs. Narsu said we should try<br>
    to make our sculptures as<br>
    realistic as possible.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She's right... it is important for<br>
    you to be able to give the clay<br>
    the shape you want it to have.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    But today you're not supposed to<br>
    concentrate on technique. I'm<br>
    here to help you focus more on the<br>
    feelings you want to convey with<br>
    your sculpture.</p>
  <p> Eric still looks confused. Troi tries to coax it out<br>
    of him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For instance... What do you think<br>
    about when you see a bird?</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    (hesitant)<br>
    Flying?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Fine. Then try to make your<br>
    sculpture make me think of flying,<br>
    too.</p>
  <p> Eric brightens, understanding, and begins eagerly<br>
    reshaping his clay. Troi smile and moves away...</p>
  <p>2 FOLLOW TROI</p>
  <p> as she leaves Eric and walks through the classroom.<br>
    She approaches Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How's it going, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have finished.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts as Data shows her his sculpture: it's a<br>
    flawless CLAY REPLICA OF A PADD. Troi looks at it,<br>
    unsure how to react.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The dimensions are accurate to<br>
    within one-point-three percent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure they are...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You obviously have no trouble with<br>
    realism, Data, but you're here to<br>
    work on using your imagination.<br>
    Maybe you should try something a<br>
    little more... abstract.</p>
  <p> Troi picks up the clay PADD and puts it aside. She<br>
    continues talking as she gets another raw LUMP OF CLAY<br>
    and sets it down in front of Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want you to start a new piece...<br>
    I'd like you to sculpt... music.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Music?</p>
  <p> Troi nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor. Music is a collection<br>
    of acoustic vibrations. How can<br>
    I reproduce a sound with clay?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Think of the effects that sounds<br>
    have on people... the images that<br>
    music brings to your mind... then<br>
    give them a form.</p>
  <p> Data thinks for a beat then pounds the clay flat. In<br>
    a few seconds, he has molded the clay into the form of<br>
    a large MUSICAL NOTE. He shows it expectantly to Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing, looks at<br>
    the shape)<br>
    It's a start.</p>
  <p> Troi moves away. Data looks curiously at his clay, not<br>
    sure what to do next.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Data... please report to<br>
    the Bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    Acknowledged. I am on my way.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is following a mysterious-looking COMET, a smoky chunk<br>
    of icy material with a small GLOWING TAIL of gas coming<br>
    off one side. On the opposite side of the tail, in the<br>
    far background behind the comet, is a star -- a small<br>
    disk at this distance.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47615.2.<br>
    We have encountered a rogue comet<br>
    in sector one-one-five-six. It is<br>
    not native to this region of<br>
    space, and there is no previous<br>
    record of this object on any<br>
    Federation charts.</p>
  <p>4 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, and Data are at their stations; N.D.<br>
    STARFLEET officers man the other positions. Everyone<br>
    is studying the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Based on its present trajectory,<br>
    the comet appears to have<br>
    originated in the D'Arsay system.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's over two sectors from<br>
    here...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct, sir. This object<br>
    has been en route for eighty-seven<br>
    million years.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's a long time alone in the<br>
    dark.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Begin a full sensor analysis,<br>
    Mister Data. Log the results for<br>
    the Federation Astrophysical<br>
    Survey.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data begins to work his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The comet's outer shell is<br>
    composed primarily of gaseous<br>
    hydrogen and helium surrounding an<br>
    icy mantle. The inner core<br>
    consists of heavier elements--</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the bridge LIGHTS FLARE, becoming<br>
    significantly brighter for a brief moment. Data cocks<br>
    his head sharply (it's not enough of a movement to be<br>
    suspicious, but in retrospect, we will realize that<br>
    something happened to him at this moment). As the<br>
    lights quickly return to normal, Data recovers and<br>
    returns his attention back to his console.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What was that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off console)<br>
    There is distortion within the<br>
    comet's inner core. I believed we<br>
    experienced an intense sensor<br>
    echo.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you correct for it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am attempting to do so now,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> A beat as Data works his console...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've compensated for the effect.<br>
    Sensors are reconfigured for a low<br>
    intensity sweep.<br>

  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    We are still picking up some<br>
    interference, but the distortion<br>
    is manageable...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    At these settings, the scan will<br>
    be complete in thirty-nine hours.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. OFF his expression.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>5 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as Troi and BEVERLY ENTER, in mid-conversation.<br>
    Beverly is carrying the 24th century equivalent of a<br>
    GYM BAG.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... Worf said he's going to be<br>
    teaching us some Mok'bara throwing<br>
    techniques today.</p>
  <p> Troi moves directly to her dresser and takes out her<br>
    martial arts gi. She continues speaking as she puts<br>
    the gi into a bag similar to Beverly's.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    More like falling techniques...<br>
    the last time we did that I was<br>
    sore for a week...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (O.S.)<br>
    What's this?</p>
  <p> Beverly is looking at a strange, solid-looking ARTIFACT<br>
    sitting on the table. It is a rectangular column, on<br>
    the top of which sits an oval that is reminiscent of a<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> Troi moves over to join her and stares at the artifact<br>
    for a puzzled beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have no idea.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe Wil left it here... a little<br>
    present?</p>
  <p> Troi picks it up and examines it more closely.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's not quite his style...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then maybe you've got a secret<br>
    admirer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That's an interesting thought...</p>
  <p> Beverly takes the artifact out of Troi's hands and puts<br>
    it back on the table.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, you can figure it out later.<br>
    We're going to be late.</p>
  <p> Troi nods, and with a last look at the artifact, the<br>
    two women EXIT.</p>
  <p>6 CLOSE ON THE ARTIFACT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A short beat after they leave, a strange<br>
    MATERIALIZATION EFFECT occurs: four pairs of lines<br>
    suddenly appear on the &quot;head&quot; -- if there were a face,<br>
    the lines would be running up the forehead, down the<br>
    nose, and across both eyes in a four cardinal direction<br>
    COMPASS DESIGN. OFF the mystery...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse, following the comet.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Riker, WORF and GEORDI are at a table. Geordi has a<br>
    TRICORDER in front of him, a PADD is next to it. Riker<br>
    idly reaches for a small BOWL of bar-type snacks.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've been getting some pretty<br>
    strange readings from that<br>
    comet... now it looks like<br>
    there's some kind of energy<br>
    generation coming from the core.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is that unusual?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The core is normally just a chunk<br>
    of rock... it should be completely<br>
    inert.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Maybe we've discovered a new kind<br>
    of comet...</p>
  <p> Riker takes a bite of a nut-like object from the bowl --<br>
    reacts with a scowl as he chokes it down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They must be changing the snacks<br>
    around here.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes one of what Riker just had from the bowl,<br>
    inspecting it carefully.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't recognize it.</p>
  <p> The waiter arrives with THREE DIFFERENT DRINKS, setting<br>
    them on the table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: snack)<br>
    Well, whatever you do, don't put<br>
    it in your mouth.</p>
  <p> They each pick up their drinks and with a &quot;cheers&quot; tip<br>
    of the glass, take a sip. Again, Riker scowls.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is terrible.</p>
  <p> He sets it down -- it is bluish and viscous. Worf<br>
    picks up Riker's drink and takes a sip.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I like it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you can have it.. but it's<br>
    not what I ordered.</p>
  <p> Geordi playfully aims his tricorder at the glass.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    Let's see what they're trying to<br>
    poison you with...</p>
  <p> His face changes when he sees the readout.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Wait a minute... this stuff is bio-organic...<br>
    there are oxygenated<br>
    cells... serum electrolytes...<br>
    This looks like some kind of...<br>
    blood.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're joking.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm serious.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm gonna have a little talk with<br>
    the bartender.</p>
  <p> Riker stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It might not be his fault. We<br>
    should check out the replicator.</p>
  <p> With a final grimace at the glass, Worf, Riker and<br>
    Geordi leave the table, heading for the bar.</p>
  <p>9 INT. CLASSROOM</p>
  <p> The clay-modelling class continues as before --<br>
    including Data working next to Eric. But some of the<br>
    students have moved on to other projects. Eric is<br>
    working in front of a computer which displays a GRAPHIC<br>
    clearly visible as text.</p>
  <p> Troi is walking slowly along, checking the clay-work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nice... Very good... I like<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> When she gets to Data she reacts with surprise.</p>
  <p>10 INCLUDE DATA'S SCULPTURE</p>
  <p> A MASK -- a kind of cross between Venetian and Mayan.<br>
    The lower face is open to leave the mouth exposed --<br>
    the upper section covers the nose and has holes for<br>
    eyes. The cheekbones sweep down and outward -- like<br>
    wings. The mask is a striking combination of the<br>
    simple and the sophisticated.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data... This is amazing. How did<br>
    you come up with this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I followed your advice, Counselor.<br>
    I used my imagination.</p>
  <p> Troi examines the unusual design of the mask.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's an understatement...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For some reason, as I shaped the<br>
    clay, the image of the mask was<br>
    exceptionally clear in my mind...<br>
    the design seemed to flow quite...<br>
    naturally.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data picks up a SMALL TOOL and begins to scribe another<br>
    design into the clay. It's the distinctive COMPASS<br>
    DESIGN: a small pair of lines running vertically up the<br>
    forehead, another pair down the nose, two others<br>
    horizontally across the eyes -- like cardinal points of<br>
    direction. Exactly like the COMPASS DESIGN on the<br>
    artifact in Troi's quarters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (recognizing it)<br>
    Data, have you been in my<br>
    quarters?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Somebody left an object in my<br>
    room... it was some kind of<br>
    artifact... and it looked similar<br>
    to this.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You don't know anything about<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not.</p>
  <p> Eric is suddenly frustrated at his computer. He moves<br>
    to Troi.</p>
  <p> ERIC<br>
    (re: screen)<br>
    Excuse me, Counselor, could you<br>
    help me with my terminal? It's<br>
    not working right.</p>
  <p>11 INCLUDE THE COMPUTER SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which displays a few dozen, individually distinct,<br>
    alien-looking ideographic symbols -- ICONS -- which<br>
    themselves are arranged in the same paired line,<br>
    COMPASS DESIGN on the mask and artifact.</p>
  <p> Data and Troi react.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we should investigate this<br>
    matter further.</p>
  <p> OFF their expressions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>12 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are working intently at the consoles.<br>
    Riker is watching over their shoulders. A screen<br>
    displays rows of normal alphanumeric characters -- and<br>
    interspersed are several pockets of the alien ICONS,<br>
    always grouped together in the same COMPASS DESIGN<br>
    arrangement. (NOTE: As Riker and Geordi talk, Data's<br>
    attention will become progressively more focused on the<br>
    screen displaying the alien symbols.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    These symbols don't match anything<br>
    in Federation linguistic banks.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Some kind of alien information has<br>
    been downloaded into our main<br>
    computer. I'm not exactly sure<br>
    how it's working, but it's<br>
    reconfiguring our systems.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How did it get in?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was able to trace its path from<br>
    the replicators to our sensor<br>
    array.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The sensors?<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    They've been scanning that comet<br>
    for the last eighteen hours...</p>
  <p> A beat as the implication sinks in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Those energy readings from the<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    What do you think, Data?</p>
  <p> But strangely, Data does not respond immediately --<br>
    he's intently studying the alien symbols on the screen.<br>
    Geordi and Riker exchange a look, and then Geordi moves<br>
    closer to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's the matter?</p>
  <p> Data slowly turns to his friend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I recognize these<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Do you think your systems may have<br>
    been affected?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility. I do not<br>
    believe my systems are currently<br>
    impaired, but I will run a full<br>
    self-diagnostic to make certain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Data and Worf at their posts. Geordi is<br>
    at the aft science station. Worf works his console,<br>
    glances up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, phasers are set for wide<br>
    dispersal, ten percent maximum<br>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>17 INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous. Everyone stares at the awe-inspiring<br>
    object on the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... What are we looking<br>
    at? Is it a ship?</p>
  <p> Data is working his console, reading the results.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe so. The object<br>
    is nearly solid, composed<br>
    primarily of fortanium and several<br>
    unknown materials... It is more<br>
    than eighty-seven million years<br>
    old.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's older than the comet<br>
    itself. Could someone in the<br>
    D'Arsay system have built it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (considers)<br>
    There are no technologically<br>
    advanced cultures in that system<br>
    now... but perhaps there were<br>
    eighty-seven million years ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But why would anyone hide<br>
    something like that inside a<br>
    comet?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's possible the frozen gasses<br>
    simply accumulated over time as it<br>
    travelled through space...</p>
  <p> Geordi breaks in from his position at Aft Science.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In any case, it's definitely<br>
    responsible for the system<br>
    anomalies we've been experiencing.<br>
    It's been using our sensor beam as<br>
    a carrier wave to get information<br>
    into our computers and<br>
    replicators.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the question remains: why?<br>
    What is its purpose?</p>
  <p> A beat as they all ponder the question. Data turns<br>
    away from his console before he speaks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I believe this object is<br>
    an informational archive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What makes you say that?</p>
  <p> Data seems a little puzzled by his statement himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I... do not know, sir. However,<br>
    I seem to have an intuitive<br>
    understanding of its function.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts -- it's a strange thing for Data to<br>
    say. Geordi moves over to Data's console and looks<br>
    over his shoulder, studying the readouts.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The internal structure of that<br>
    thing is pretty complex... and<br>
    it's got a repetitive node<br>
    configuration which might suggest<br>
    a database of some kind... but it<br>
    could be practically anything.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I don't see how you could know for<br>
    sure what it is.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Data, concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data... do you believe you're in<br>
    communication with that object?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility, sir. I<br>
    recommend that we perform a level<br>
    one diagnostic of my positronic<br>
    net immediately to determine if<br>
    that is the case.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well... Mister LaForge, give<br>
    him a hand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data acknowledge and move away, EXITING the<br>
    Bridge. An N.D. Starfleet Officer takes over Data's<br>
    position at Ops. Picard and Riker continue to study<br>
    the alien object.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Do you think it's just trying to<br>
    make contact with us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    Perhaps. And if this really is an<br>
    archive from some ancient<br>
    civilization, we should allow it<br>
    to do so. But we must be<br>
    careful...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Worf, keep an eye on the<br>
    sensors. If the Archive poses any<br>
    danger to the ship, I want you to<br>
    sever the connection immediately.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's fascinated expression.</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship following the ancient object.</p>
  <p>19 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> The room is now dotted with ARTIFACTS -- on the<br>
    shelves, on the desk, on the floor -- collected from<br>
    all over the ship. They all share the same vaguely<br>
    Mayan look we've seen before.</p>
  <p> Picard is standing in the middle of the room, examining<br>
    the artifact from Troi's room. The cylinder has the<br>
    now-familiar COMPASS DESIGN carved on its surface.<br>
    Picard studies it carefully, jotting an occasional note<br>
    on a PADD -- if not for the surroundings, he might be<br>
    an archaeologist on a dig.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS -- and stops short, reacting to the sight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard motions Riker in but doesn't stop working.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come in, Number One...</p>
  <p> Riker moves closer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've confined the system<br>
    corruption. It's not spreading<br>
    any further, but we've still got<br>
    alien symbols floating around<br>
    inside our computer...</p>
  <p> Picard merely nods and jots another note onto his PADD<br>
    and moves to study another object.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is quite a collection you've<br>
    assembled...</p>
  <p> Riker picks up an object and looks it over...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've seen these things all over<br>
    the ship. They all look the<br>
    same... primitive and non-functional.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (correcting him)<br>
    Ceremonial... and deceptively<br>
    primitive. Only an advanced<br>
    technological culture could have<br>
    built that object out there.<br>
    These artifacts must have played<br>
    a ritualistic role in their<br>
    society.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you think Data's right? Have<br>
    we stumbled across some kind of<br>
    alien library?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard clearly likes the notion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's possible... and if so, this<br>
    could be a find of enormous<br>
    significance. This &quot;library&quot;<br>
    seems designed to do far more than<br>
    simply store information. Who<br>
    knows how much we could learn from<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at Picard's obvious excitement. He<br>
    glances at the COMPASS DESIGN carved on the stone<br>
    cylinder seen earlier.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I keep seeing this design...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It seems to be a symbol of some<br>
    significance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you think it means?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (offers)<br>
    The concept of the four cardinal<br>
    compass directions is common to<br>
    many different cultures...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The words Data recognized on the<br>
    computer -- &quot;boundary,&quot; &quot;border,&quot;<br>
    &quot;road&quot; -- they were also arranged<br>
    in that design.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps everything with the<br>
    compass design is part of the same<br>
    theme -- movement. Finding a<br>
    direction, travelling a path,<br>
    crossing a boundary--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And &quot;death.&quot; One of the symbols<br>
    was &quot;death.&quot;</p>

    The ultimate boundary.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and picks up a small STONE NECKLACE with<br>
    a stylized SUN-DESIGN PENDANT (similar to the symbol<br>
    seen in Act 1.) He turns it over.</p>
  <p>20 INSERT - THE PENDANT</p>
  <p> On the back is a small symbol -- off to one side, as if<br>
    not wanting to be the center of attention. It is the<br>
    symbol of what we will come to know as the moon.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    I keep seeing this symbol, too....<br>
    but it's never prominently<br>
    displayed...</p>
  <p>21 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Always in the background...<br>
    smaller than the others...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know what it represents?</p>

    artifacts we've already seen, as if the positronic<br>
    brain itself has been transformed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Data suddenly turns toward Geordi -- the compass design<br>
    he scribed on the mask is now on his own face, in<br>
    raised, tiny scars. A ceremonial NECKPLATE with a<br>
    distinctive design has also appeared around Data's<br>
    neck.</p>
  <p> Data looks at Geordi and smiles, his voice animated and<br>

  <p>23 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data, his head plate now back in place, is moving<br>
    around the room in an energetic, very non-Data fashion,<br>
    curiously inspecting his surroundings as though he's<br>
    never seen this place before. Geordi watches him,<br>
    concerned.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS with TWO N.D. STARFLEET Security Guards.<br>
    As the guards fan out cautiously, watching Data, Geordi<br>
    turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, he just--</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I waited for you, Captain. You<br>
    should feel honored... I don't<br>
    usually wait for anybody.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to Data's loose manner.</p>

    What were my exact words?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You said, &quot;Masaka is waking.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    And isn't that what I've been<br>
    saying since we first met?</p>
  <p> Geordi nods. Satisfied, Data/Ihat turns back to<br>

    Commander Data... ?</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat seems to be momentarily at a loss, apparently<br>
    not understanding what Picard is referring to; but<br>
    then, he brightens, and indicates his own body.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You mean the one who was here?</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to the phrasing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    He's gone. And who can say where?</p>
  <p> Picard has seen enough to know that he's going to need<br>

  <p> Ihat is again moving around the room, taking in his<br>

    Ihat. The place you came from...<br>
    Is it a cultural archive of your<br>

  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (simply)<br>
    I come from Masaka's city.</p>

  <p> Picard and Geordi react. Data/Ihat indicates the room.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>

    it is now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pressing)<br>
    I would like to know more about<br>
    this Masaka... perhaps we can<br>

  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Do you understand pain? Death?<br>
    That is all you need to know about<br>

    after him.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    You must go... leave this place<br>
    before she finds you. It can be<br>
    done... I did it...</p>
  <p> At that moment, Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's going on, sir?</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat whirls at the sound of her voice, surprised.<br>
    When he sees Troi, all trace of swagger vanishes,<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gravely, to N.D.<br>
    Security)<br>
    Get him to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> As Geordi and the N.D. Security Guards move to take<br>
    Data away, Picard and Troi exchange a concerned look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>24 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as before, travelling with the ancient archive.</p>
  <p>25 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Beverly, Troi, and Geordi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Every time he saw Deanna, he'd<br>
    fall to his knees screaming &quot;Take<br>
    me, Masaka -- take me.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data was acting as if he were a<br>
    sacrificial victim of some kind...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And apparently one all too willing<br>
    to go to his death.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I put him in isolation in his<br>
    quarters. He's under guard... he<br>
    seems to have calmed down a<br>
    little.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Couldn't we just shut him down and<br>
    purge his memory systems?</p>
  <p> Geordi shakes his head grimly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think it's going to be<br>
    that simple...</p>
  <p> Geordi gets up, moves to the monitor, where there is a<br>
    GRAPHIC of a complex web of interconnections, but the<br>
    connections have been radically reorganized into<br>
    several centers -- nodal points with complex webs<br>
    radiating from each. The structure suggests the<br>
    vaguely Mayan alien designs we've seen before.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is a micrograph of what's<br>
    happened to Data's positronic net.<br>
    As near as I can tell, these are<br>
    behavioral nodes... I've found<br>
    fourteen of them so far.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think the Archive is using Data<br>
    to create different &quot;people&quot; from<br>
    its culture... in the same way it<br>
    used our replicators to create<br>
    artifacts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    As a result, his real personality<br>
    has been completely buried. In a<br>
    sense, Data has the android<br>
    equivalent of multiple<br>
    personalities.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And the Archive hasn't stopped<br>
    yet... Data's positronic net is<br>
    still being transformed. There's<br>
    no way to tell how many more<br>
    personalities might emerge...</p>
  <p> There's a stunned beat as everyone takes in the<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our sensors are still in contact<br>
    with the Archive. Would there be<br>
    a risk to Data if we severed that<br>
    connection?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know... but I wouldn't<br>
    want to take the chance. Right<br>
    now, our only link to the Archive<br>
    is that sensor beam. If there's<br>
    a way to reverse what's happened<br>
    to Data, I think we're going to<br>
    need that link to do it.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat to consider his limited options.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, continue to scan<br>
    the Archive. Try to find some way<br>
    to access it. In the meantime,<br>
    I'll see what I can learn from<br>
    these &quot;people&quot; inside Data.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's grim expression.</p>
  <p>26 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The DOOR OPENS and Picard ENTERS. Two Security Guards<br>
    can be seen standing outside. Data is on the floor,<br>
    curled up tightly in a corner of the room (he is still<br>
    in his &quot;Victim&quot; personality). As Picard approaches<br>
    him, he recoils.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - ACT THREE 29A.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    It's all right... I'm not going to<br>
    hurt you...</p>
  <p> DATA/VICTIM<br>
    Only Masaka can hurt me... I am<br>
    for her alone...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I need to speak to Ihat. Do you<br>
    understand me? Ihat...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> For a moment, Data/Victim returns nothing but a fearful<br>
    stare, uncomprehending and empty. But then, Data jerks<br>
    suddenly -- when he turns back to Picard, he has<br>
    changed into his Ihat personality.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard is almost glad to see him. Data/Ihat goes into<br>
    his customary high-energy mode and starts pacing around<br>
    the room.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That was a cruel joke to play on<br>
    me. For a moment -- a brief<br>
    moment -- I actually thought that<br>
    woman was Masaka.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whoever took your place wasn't<br>
    afraid of Masaka -- he almost<br>
    seemed eager for his fate.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Pitiful, isn't it?<br>
    (mock Victim voice)<br>
    &quot;Take me! Take me!&quot; Ha. You<br>
    wouldn't catch me humiliating<br>
    myself for a woman -- even if she<br>
    were a queen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then Masaka is your queen... ?</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    She's a lazy creature... she<br>
    spends most of her time<br>
    sleeping...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The problem is what she does when<br>
    she's awake.</p>
  <p> Picard has no choice but to play along.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then should we try to keep her<br>
    asleep?</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Try to keep the sun from climbing<br>
    the sky? Only Korgano can do<br>
    that. And he's not here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is he?</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Data/Ihat collapses onto the floor, pulling<br>
    himself inward, knees huddled together, head down, arms<br>
    tight.</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    Help me... please...</p>
  <p> Picard steps over and Data looks up. The Ihat<br>
    neckplate is gone. In its place is ANOTHER NECKPLATE<br>
    with yet another distinctive design -- Data has now<br>
    assumed the personality of a frightened Boy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    I'm afraid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of what?</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    Of her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Masaka?</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    Her.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP TREMBLES. Lights go out; emergency<br>
    lighting comes on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    Picard to Bridge! Report!</p>
  <p>27 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Lots of activity. Riker is on his feet, Geordi is at<br>
    Aft Science. Worf is heading quickly toward the<br>
    Turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    The Archive just activated some<br>
    kind of tractor beam, sir. We<br>
    can't disengage it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Has there been any damage to the<br>
    ship?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Nothing major, sir, but Ten<br>
    Forward reported an emergency.<br>
    Worf's on his way.</p>
  <p> Geordi glances up from his console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain, there's some kind of<br>
    energy pulse coming through the<br>
    tractor beam...</p>
  <p>28 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's overriding our control<br>
    systems...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    I'll be right there...</p>
  <p> Picard starts to move away but stops short -- Data/Boy<br>
    has a vice-like grip on Picard's wrist.</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    Don't leave me.</p>
  <p> Data's hand slowly grips tighter with his android<br>
    strength. Picard stifles a cry of pain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I... I... won't... leave you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Please... let go...</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    Does it hurt?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (barely)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    She's going to hurt us all...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data stares at him for a moment longer and then<br>
    abruptly releases his grip. As Picard grabs his wrist<br>
    in pain, Data jerks and stares up at Picard -- he has<br>
    changed again and is now back in his Ihat personality.<br>
    He smiles ruefully at Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Now you've done it. Masaka is<br>
    awake.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p>29 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Two Security Guards are hurrying up a<br>
    corridor. They arrive at Ten-Forward and step quickly<br>
    through the entrance.</p>
  <p>30 INT. TEN-FORWARD - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Worf and his officers are shocked at what they find.<br>
    The room has been transformed. Tropical foliage is<br>
    everywhere, green vines and huge, red, fern-like<br>
    fronds. Half the tables are gone -- stone slabs take<br>
    their place. The patrons are standing around in<br>
    stunned silence.</p>
  <p> The bar has been partially transformed into rough<br>
    stone; a stone column stands near it, and inscribed<br>
    prominently on it is a LARGE FEMALE FACE IN THE RADIANT<br>
    SHAPE OF A SUN.</p>
  <p> OFF their stunned expressions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 34.</p>
  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>31 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A powerful beam is being continuously projected from<br>
    the Archive into the saucer section of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>32 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Like the rest of the ship, the room is dark and lit<br>
    only by emergency lights. All non-essential personnel<br>
    have been cleared, and Geordi and Worf are using<br>
    tricorders to scan the vegetation and stone slabs.</p>
  <p> Picard circles around the sun image, studying it,<br>
    trying to fit things together as Troi watches nearby.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (re: sun image)<br>
    Who is this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd say it's Masaka. Ihat<br>
    referred to her as a queen... it's<br>
    not unusual in ceremonial cultures<br>
    for royalty to be symbolized by a<br>
    sun.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You said the personalities inside<br>
    Data were in awe of her... even<br>
    terrified.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    According to Data, the sun image<br>
    is also the symbol for death.</p>
  <p> They move to the back of the column, where Picard<br>
    notices something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There it is again... this U-shaped<br>
    symbol... small and<br>
    insignificant... almost like an<br>
    afterthought...</p>
  <p> But before Troi can respond, Geordi and Worf approach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 34A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, this is incredible...<br>
    These artifacts weren't beamed<br>
    over here from the archive... the<br>
    matter in Ten Forward was<br>
    transformed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Into living plants? How is that<br>
    possible?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 35.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure. But bit by bit, the<br>
    ship's being transformed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have received reports from the<br>
    rest of the ship. Part of deck<br>
    twelve is now an aqueduct.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What are we being transformed<br>
    into?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure I want to find out.</p>
  <p> Picard takes in the information. It's a difficult<br>
    decision for him to make, but there's no alternative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think we have a choice...<br>
    we'll have to destroy the Archive.<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, our weapon control systems<br>
    are inoperative. However, we<br>
    could configure a photon torpedo<br>
    for manual launch...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf turn and EXIT. Picard and Troi look<br>
    around the strangely transformed room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's so much here we could have<br>
    learned... I regret losing that<br>
    opportunity.</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges his ambivalence.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FOUR 36.</p>
  <p>33 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Emergency lighting only. A PHOTON TORPEDO lies on a<br>
    cradle between the pool table and the warp core. A<br>
    control panel on the torpedo casing flickers with<br>
    several lights. Geordi works at the pool table console<br>
    as Worf scans the torpedo.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... I've locked in the<br>
    targeting parameters... what's the<br>
    phase alignment now?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Less than point seven percent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That'll do it. I'm setting the<br>
    yield at maximum...</p>
  <p> But at Geordi works, the control panel lights on the<br>
    torpedo go dead.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Sir... the onboard power systems<br>
    are not functioning...</p>
  <p> Geordi crosses to the torpedo, tries to activate it<br>
    manually, but it doesn't work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's going on here... ?</p>
  <p> Geordi opens up the casing and both men look inside...</p>
  <p>34 INSIDE THE TORPEDO</p>
  <p> It is full of writhing snakes.</p>
  <p>35 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf and Geordi react and jump back -- then they turn<br>
    around and see the awesome IMAGE OF MASAKA which now<br>
    fills the entire back panel of Engineering. A few<br>
    vines are hanging on the walls.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something tells me we'd better get<br>
    out of here...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They quickly move toward the exit -- only to be driven<br>
    back by a roaring WALL OF FLAMES that shoots up in<br>
    front of the them... The room around them has become a<br>
    nightmarish, hell-like place.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    Engineering to Bridge -- emergency<br>
    transport! Two to beam out...</p>
  <p> Geordi and Worf DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>36 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship still held by the beams from the Archive.</p>
  <p>37 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The Bridge is dark, lit only by the emergency lights.<br>
    The walls are hung with strange, ominous vines.</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi are near the Aft Science station,<br>
    heading for the Observation Lounge when those DOORS<br>
    OPEN and Riker comes out onto the Bridge. He's a<br>
    little shaken from seeing something in that room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we'd better talk in here.<br>
    The Observation Lounge seems to<br>
    have become a swamp.</p>
  <p> Nobody argues with him. They gather around the command<br>
    area, where Worf, Beverly, and Geordi join them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    What's our status?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So far the Archive's transformed<br>
    over twenty percent of the ship...<br>
    and we've lost main propulsion and<br>
    weapons systems in the process.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about communications?<br>
    Sensors? Life support?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We have communications, and<br>
    limited sensor control. Life<br>
    support seems unaffected.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've been analyzing samples of<br>
    these alien plant forms. They've<br>
    been formed from biological matter<br>
    we have on the ship...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The stone, the artifacts...<br>
    they're made the same way --<br>
    extrapolated from the ship's own<br>
    alloys.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Apparently the Archive can reorder<br>
    and transform molecular structures --<br>
    including DNA -- to make whatever<br>
    it wants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So it's using our ship -- our<br>
    alloys, our DNA, -- to create<br>
    elements of its own culture...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But why is all this happening?<br>
    What is the Archive trying to<br>
    accomplish?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It could be a weapon.</p>
  <p> They all look at him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is powerful and insidious. It<br>
    has completely disarmed us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe it's more benign than that.<br>
    If a civilization were dying...<br>
    they might have created this<br>
    technology to preserve their<br>
    culture, and re-create it at some<br>
    later point...</p>
  <p> Picard paces, trying to fit the pieces together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It could even be a sophisticated<br>
    terraforming device.</p>
  <p> The others look at him quizzically.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Archive creates an<br>
    environment... all the elements<br>
    which enable a culture to exist...</p>
  <p> They realize there are many possibilities -- and that<br>
    they may never know the real reason behind this<br>
    technology.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But whatever the intent behind the<br>
    process, I don't want this ship<br>
    transformed into an alien city.<br>
    Mister La Forge, do you have any<br>
    ideas?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We still haven't been able to cut<br>
    off that beam... but I've managed<br>
    to access the Archive by sending<br>
    an energy pulse back along their<br>
    signal path. If I can locate the<br>
    transformation program, I might be<br>
    able to get control of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good, keep at it...</p>
  <p> Picard turns to gaze at the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p>38 ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Masaka's mask looms over them.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    But somehow... I believe the<br>
    answer lies there...</p>
  <p>39 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... with Masaka. We need to find<br>
    her... access her... talk to her.</p>
  <p> The others acknowledge -- this must be done.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>40 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Even darker than the Bridge. The door opens and Picard<br>
    steps inside. A small fire is burning on the other<br>
    side of the cabin -- on the now dirt-covered floor.<br>
    Data is crouched down besides it, warming his hands.</p>
  <p> As Picard approaches, he sees that Data is wearing a<br>
    NEW NECKPLATE, one he hasn't seen before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (cautious)<br>
    Hello...</p>
  <p> Data's voice is old and tired, and he moves slowly and<br>
    with difficulty like an old man.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    It's difficult... to stay warm...</p>
  <p> Picard sits down next to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The fire feels good...</p>
  <p> Data/Elder looks at him quizzically.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    But it's not warm enough. Not for<br>
    an old man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me... about Masaka.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    My daughter?</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, amazed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... how can I talk to her?</p>
  <p> Data/Elder laughs -- a dry, cackling rasp.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    Talk -- to Masaka?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. It's important. Can you<br>
    tell her I must speak with her?</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    Children grow... forget their<br>
    parents... no, only Korgano can<br>
    talk to Masaka.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Korgano... who is that?</p>
  <p> Data/Elder seems to lose interest... stares back into<br>
    the fire.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    So cold... can't stay warm...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Data/Elder seems to crumple into a limp<br>
    heap... and then he jumps up, vital and hyper (NOTE: he<br>
    is now wearing his Ihat neckplate).</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Well, you're a persistent one,<br>
    aren't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ihat?</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Is anyone else so charming?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Masaka is taking over my ship.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    I told you she would.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want to talk with her... but I'm<br>
    told only Korgano can do that.</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat is wary, alert.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Who told you that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An old man... Masaka's father...</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Ah, yes... legends say she chopped<br>
    him up and used his bones to make<br>
    the world.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Any wonder he doesn't like to talk<br>
    about her?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can I find Korgano?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    I don't know. He's not chasing<br>
    her anymore.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where has he gone?</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat paces, agitated, uncomfortable with all this.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    Stop asking these questions. I<br>
    was fast enough to avoid her<br>
    once... I don't want her to find<br>
    me again. I'll end up on her<br>
    sacrificial slab.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If Masaka is looking for a<br>
    sacrifice... she can take me<br>
    instead.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps then she'd stop looking<br>
    for you.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (a chuckle)<br>
    Well, there's an idea. Better you<br>
    than me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. Tell me what to do...</p>
  <p> There is a hesitation, as though Ihat is coming to a<br>
    decision. Then --</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    You must build Masaka's temple...<br>
    the Queen's temple. That will get<br>
    her attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. How do I do that?</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    You need the sign.<br>
    (beat, coy)<br>
    I could give it to you... so could<br>
    the Old Man. But just try getting<br>
    it out of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Give me the sign.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat in an agony of indecision.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    If she finds out...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You can't imagine her rage... she<br>
    lets people die of thirst... a<br>
    terrible death. Sometimes she<br>
    burns them alive...<br>
    (beat, in awe)<br>
    She is glorious.</p>
  <p> But Picard is impatient with all this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ihat... the sign. What is it?</p>
  <p> Data/Ihat looks around him, as though ascertaining that<br>
    no one else is around.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    If she comes... you'll take my<br>
    place?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    All right. Quickly. Give me your<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> Picard holds out his hand. Data/Ihat takes it, turns<br>
    it face up, and starts &quot;drawing&quot; a line with one finger<br>
    across Picard's palm.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A line, as the unending horizon...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A curve as --</p>
  <p> Suddenly Data freezes. A look of terror crosses his<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    She has found me.</p>
  <p> Picard looks for another change in Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Masaka, show yourself. I'll go<br>
    with you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> But Data/Ihat sinks to his knees.</p>
  <p> DATA/IHAT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It seems... I was not fast<br>
    enough...</p>
  <p> His head droops. Picard crouches down beside him.<br>
    Then Data looks up -- he's wearing the Elder's<br>
    neckplate. Data crumples into a seated position near<br>
    the fire, stretches his hands toward it.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    So hard to stay warm...</p>
  <p> Picard needs to find a way to reach this man. He moves<br>
    closer to him and helps him build up the fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me help you...</p>
  <p> Data/Elder glances at him.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    Are you one of my children?<br>
    (turns to fire)<br>
    I don't remember anymore.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need your help. I need the sign<br>
    for the temple.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Masaka's temple.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    It won't help you. Korgano no<br>
    longer pursues her. No one else<br>
    can stop her.</p>
  <p> Picard cautiously reaches out and takes Data's hand,<br>
    guiding it to the floor, using Data's fingers to draw<br>
    a line in the dirt, repeating Ihat's words from memory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A line... as the unending<br>
    horizon...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A curve...</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't know any more. The old man doesn't<br>
    resist, but isn't responding either. Picard tries<br>
    again, tracing the pattern and repeating the words.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A line... as the unending horizon.</p>
  <p> PICARD DATA/ELDER<br>
    A curve... A curve...</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    ... as a rolling hillside.</p>
  <p> Data finishes the curve and makes a dot above it.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A point... as a distant bird.</p>
  <p> And another line drawn vertical to the horizon.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A ray... as the rising sun.</p>
  <p> He stops, finished. The symbol is complete.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELDER<br>
    Now sit with me... tend the<br>
    fire...</p>
  <p> Data suddenly slumps over. He is completely still for<br>
    a beat, then he looks up, wearing the neckplate of the<br>
    Frightened Boy.</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    I'm alone... there's no one left<br>
    to help me... she's coming.</p>
  <p> Picard pulls him upright.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are the others dead? Did Masaka<br>
    kill them?</p>
  <p> DATA/BOY<br>
    No. She sent them away. It will<br>
    take them days to die.</p>
  <p> Data suddenly freezes. His mouth opens in a circle and<br>
    holds perfectly still. And out of the open mouth comes<br>
    an eerie wail -- a child's scream plunging into a<br>
    bottomless nightmare.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> The voice finally disappears. Data slumps over.<br>
    Picard pulls back his head: the neckplate is gone and<br>
    there are NO SCARS on his forehead. Data stares into<br>
    space, his eyes wide, as if there were nothing behind<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>41 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship still being held by the Archive's beam.</p>
  <p>42 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before, only the emergency lights are functioning<br>
    and ominous vines hang across several consoles; but<br>
    now, the normal command seats have been transformed<br>
    into simple STONE PEDESTALS.</p>
  <p>43 ANGLE ON AFT SCIENCE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, and Troi are gathered around Geordi.<br>
    The screen displays a GRAPHIC of the TEMPLE SYMBOL<br>
    drawn by the Elder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think I've found the Archive's<br>
    transformation program.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will it accept the symbol for<br>
    Masaka's temple?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think so. I've isolated the<br>
    program's input pathways. They're<br>
    keyed to accept symbols...</p>
  <p> He gestures toward the display.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If I input this one, it should<br>
    initiate the transformation<br>
    process...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And create the temple?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I hope so... if this is the wrong<br>
    symbol, it might turn the<br>
    Enterprise into a big chunk of<br>
    rock. There's no way to be sure.</p>
  <p> It's a tough choice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The question is... can we trust a<br>
    personality from an alien Archive<br>
    that seems bent on taking us over?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (considers)<br>
    Ihat risked his life to show me<br>
    that symbol... and Masaka killed<br>
    him for doing it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think we have to risk it.</p>
  <p> OFF their expressions.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>44 INT. CORRIDOR</p>

    Captain. The entire deck has been<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye, sir. I'm inputting the<br>

    Now...</p>
  <p> He taps a final button on his console...</p>
  <p>46 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> For a moment, nothing seems to happen. Picard, Troi,<br>
    and Worf exchange puzzled looks, and then suddenly, the<br>
    walls dissolve into...</p>
  <p>47 INT. TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> It's a huge, cavernous room that seems to have been<br>
    carved out of a rockface. Stone slabs and columns are<br>
    placed here and there, some adorned with engraved<br>
    figures and symbols. Sitting on a raised platform is<br>
    a GOLDEN THRONE in the shape of a solar disc. The<br>
    group turns around, looking at the trappings, taking<br>
    everything in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: throne)<br>
    This would seem to be Masaka's<br>
    temple...</p>
  <p> Worf looks warily around the room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There's no one else here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ihat said creating the temple<br>
    would get her attention... it may<br>
    take time before she shows<br>
    herself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And how will she do that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> Troi has been off to one side, looking at the columns.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... look at this.</p>
  <p> They join her and she gestures to --</p>
  <p>48 A STONE COLUMN</p>
  <p> In the face of the column is carved two different<br>
    images: Masaka's sun symbol is shown large and<br>
    prominent in the foreground; but smaller, and to one<br>
    side, as if receding into the distance, the small<br>
    &quot;horns&quot; symbol Picard has seen before is also evident.</p>
  <p>49 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Picard looks closely at the symbols.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the first time I've seen<br>
    these two symbols paired... That<br>
    could be significant...</p>
  <p> He glances around, sees other instances of the two<br>
    symbols together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There it is again... and again.<br>
    Clearly this is an important<br>
    pairing...</p>
  <p> He stops, remembering something.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;He's not chasing her anymore... &quot;</p>
  <p> They look at him quizzically.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ihat said that someone named<br>
    Korgano was not chasing Masaka<br>
    anymore. And the old man said,<br>
    &quot;he pursues her no longer... &quot;</p>
  <p> He gestures to the horn symbol.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; 12/09/93 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In a sense, this smaller symbol is<br>
    chasing Masaka. Perhaps it<br>
    represents Korgano.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The symbol suggests antlers of<br>
    some kind... horns. Maybe it's<br>
    meant to represent an animal...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Animal gods are worshipped in many<br>
    cultures...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Both Ihat and the old man said<br>
    that Korgano was the only one who<br>
    could control Masaka...<br>
    (beat, thinking)<br>
    Many ritualistic cultures<br>
    incorporate the idea of &quot;balance&quot;<br>
    into their belief systems. Masaka<br>
    is a queen, a powerful, god-like<br>
    figure... it's not unreasonable to<br>
    assume that she might have a<br>
    counterpart... or a consort...</p>
  <p> Picard begins to look around the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Spread out... see if you can find<br>
    that horn-like symbol anywhere<br>
    else.</p>
  <p> And they begin to move around the room.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>50 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Data is sitting on the floor, eyes closed, in the same<br>
    catatonic-like state he was in when last seen.</p>
  <p>51 CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE</p>
  <p> as his eyes abruptly snap open.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>52 ON DATA - WIDER</p>
  <p> As he stands. He moves toward a table which contains<br>
    a richly colored version of the MASK he first molded in<br>
    clay -- MASAKA'S MASK. He lifts it to his face.</p>
  <p>53 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as the DOORS OPEN and Data, wearing the mask, steps out<br>
    into the hall. Before the two N.D. Security Guards<br>
    even have a chance to react, Data disables them both,<br>
    knocking them to the ground unconscious. Without<br>
    another look back, he walks on down the hall...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>54 INT. TEMPLE</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, and Worf are clustered in front of<br>
    another STONE COLUMN, studying another glyph showing<br>
    Masaka's sun image and the horn symbol. However, this<br>
    time, the horn symbol is large and prominent while<br>
    Masaka's sun is small and receding.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is the most prominent<br>
    instance of the horn symbol we've<br>
    seen yet...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But now it appears as though<br>
    Masaka's sun is chasing it.</p>
  <p> Troi is thinking aloud, trying to piece it together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    An animal chasing the sun... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maybe it's simpler than that.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Maybe the relationship between<br>
    them is more like the sun and the<br>
    moon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I see... Masaka and Korgano<br>
    changing positions... the sun<br>
    setting and the moon rising.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/14/93 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly. Two powerful rulers,<br>
    changing places in a continuous<br>
    cycle...</p>
  <p> A beat as they consider the notion.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And like the sun and the moon,<br>
    only one of them can be in<br>
    ascendance at any given time...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we could find Korgano within<br>
    the Archive and bring him out...<br>
    perhaps he could force Masaka to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But would we be any better off<br>
    with him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (considers)<br>
    Ihat and the others didn't seem to<br>
    be afraid of Korgano...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the SHIP TREMBLES. The group whirls to see<br>
    Data/Masaka as she ENTERS the temple and moves<br>
    majestically toward the throne.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Masaka...</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka sits down upon the throne and silently<br>
    looks out at her temple. Picard, Troi, and Worf<br>
    cautiously approach the throne.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Masaka, I am Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the Federation--</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    (cutting him off)<br>
    Go away.</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka doesn't even look at them when she speaks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (presses on)<br>
    Please listen to us. Your Archive<br>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    I do not hear you.</p>
  <p> Worf slowly draws his phaser, but Picard stays his<br>
    hand. He motions to the other two to back down, and<br>
    they all move slowly away from the throne.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    She won't even listen to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then we'll have to find someone<br>
    she will listen to.</p>
  <p> OFF their expressions.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> Geordi is working his console as Picard watches<br>
    anxiously; Troi and Riker are standing nearby. Worf is<br>
    in the b.g. at Tactical. The mood is tense and<br>
    serious.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've found it, sir...</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates his monitor which displays a single<br>
    GRAPHIC: it's Korgano's moon symbol.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Picard stares at the image for a moment, pondering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, access the<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Isn't that a little risky?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We have no way of knowing what the<br>

    generate anything from Korgano's<br>
    temple... to Korgano himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In some sense, Korgano is Masaka's<br>

    I've accessed the program, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to the others, takes a breath...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Initiate the transformation.</p>
  <p> Geordi hits a command on his console. There's a tense<br>
    moment; no one's sure what's going to happen and<br>
    they're ready for anything. Then a simple, SILVER MASK<br>
    APPEARS -- on its forehead is Korgano's moon symbol.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Another mask...</p>
  <p> Picard picks up the mask and looks at it thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps we've been approaching<br>
    this incorrectly. We're dealing<br>
    with a highly ritualistic<br>
    culture... a society based on<br>
    symbol and myth. Maybe we need to<br>
    confront them on those terms<br>
    instead...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If I can incorporate myself into<br>
    their rituals, perhaps Masaka will<br>
    listen to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/15/93 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    You're going to pose as Korgano.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and holds the mask up to his face, testing<br>
    the fit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, we know so little about<br>
    this culture... and even less<br>
    about Korgano himself. How will<br>
    you convince Masaka that you're<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not entirely sure. But there<br>
    are similarities between this<br>
    culture and others I've studied.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I suppose I'll just have to<br>
    improvise.</p>
  <p> There's a grim beat -- but they all know that there's<br>
    really no other choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, what's our status?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I estimate we have less than two<br>
    hours before there's nothing left<br>
    of the ship... at least nothing<br>
    that we recognize.</p>
  <p> Picard nods grimly and heads for the Turbolift. He<br>
    holds the mask in his hands as he EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>56 INT. TEMPLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka is sitting on the throne.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Masaka!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/13/93 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka reacts as Picard approaches -- he is<br>
    wearing the Korgano mask. For the first time, we see<br>
    a real reaction from Data/Masaka -- she's shocked at<br>
    the sight.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    Korgano... ?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a step closer -- he's playing it by ear,<br>
    choosing his words carefully, taking it one step at a<br>
    time...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you surprised to see me?</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka rises from the throne, begins walking down<br>
    the stairs. She's regained her bearings now, and is<br>
    trying to maintain control of the situation.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    I thought I had escaped you.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You should know that's impossible.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    You are a fine hunter... but I am<br>
    a powerful prey. You will never<br>
    catch me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you really want to be the<br>
    prey... forever?</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka seems to consider this.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    I thought I was alone here. I<br>
    thought I wouldn't have to share<br>
    the sky with you...</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward Data, carefully, not threatening,<br>
    a reasonable man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But without me... you aren't<br>
    complete. I know you, Masaka...<br>
    you live for the chase just as<br>
    much as I do.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/10/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Won't you miss being the hunter...<br>
    pursuing me... forcing me from the<br>
    sky so that you can rise again?</p>
  <p> A hesitation.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    You know me well, Korgano...</p>
  <p> Picard now senses he has the upper hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think you may be getting<br>
    tired... it's difficult to<br>
    brighten the sky forever...</p>
  <p> Data/Masaka smiles wanly... does seem a little weary.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    I am getting sleepy... you always<br>
    do that to me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Only so you can wake at dawn...<br>
    and begin the hunt again...</p>
  <p> Another smile. Data/Masaka slowly sits on the throne,<br>
    head still erect and queenly, but eyes heavy.</p>
  <p> DATA/MASAKA<br>
    Begin the hunt again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am eager for that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As am I.</p>
  <p> Data's eyes close. The ship TREMBLES. The room<br>
    DISSOLVES to --</p>
  <p>57 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The temple is gone. Everyone is back in the corridor,<br>
    reacting to the transformation. And to Data -- who<br>
    stands before them, not wearing a mask (neither is<br>
    Picard), blinking a bit in confusion.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Picard... I don't know<br>
    what you did, sir... but it looks<br>
    like everything's back to normal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/15/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Acknowledged.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Mister Data -- are you all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so, sir. But I am not<br>
    entirely certain what has<br>
    happened. Have I been dreaming<br>
    again?</p>
  <p> Picard puts his hand on Data's shoulder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid it will take some time<br>
    to explain.</p>
  <p> He smiles reassuringly and Data accepts this, his old<br>
    equanimity having returned. Off their relieved<br>
    expressions --</p>
  <p>58 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 47612.4.<br>
    Commander La Forge has managed to<br>
    disable the alien transformation<br>
    program. Starfleet will send an<br>
    archaeological team to study the<br>
    Archive further.</p>
  <p>59 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Data with Picard; Picard holds the mask Data wore as<br>
    Masaka, turning it in his hands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand... I thought<br>
    all the alien artifacts had<br>
    disappeared from the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This was not created by the<br>
    Archive... this is the clay mask<br>
    I originally made. I have since<br>
    glazed it.</p>
  <p> Picard is intrigued.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Masks&quot; REV. 12/13/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Although I am relieved to be<br>
    rid of those alien<br>
    personalities... there is a sense<br>
    in which I am now... empty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can imagine. Doctor Crusher<br>
    said there might have been dozens<br>
    of personalities inside you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suspect the number was much<br>
    greater.</p>
  <p> Data pauses, reflecting on the unusual experience.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My impression is that there were<br>
    thousands... of all ages and walks<br>
    of life.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It was a remarkable experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Data, you may never become<br>
    fully human... but you've had an<br>
    experience that transcends the<br>
    human condition.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You have been an entire<br>
    civilization.</p>
  <p> Data briefly ponders the significance of this... then<br>
    Picard hands him back the mask.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (wry)<br>
    Nonetheless... it's time to stand<br>
    watch on the night shift.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. Good night.</p>
  <p> He turns and EXITS.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
