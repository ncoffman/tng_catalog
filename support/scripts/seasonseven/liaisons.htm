    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON WORF'S FACE. He looks disgusted. Off camera,<br>
    his hands are working furiously at something... and he<br>
    grows more and more agitated by whatever he's doing...</p>
  <p>2 WIDEN TO REVEAL</p>
  <p> Worf standing in front of a mirror. He is wearing a<br>
    Starfleet DRESS UNIFORM -- a thigh-level tunic with<br>
    pants underneath. He is attempting to tie an ornate<br>
    SASH around his chest, but it isn't easy. He steps<br>
    back and takes a look -- it's crooked and sloppy.<br>
    Frustrated, he undoes the sash and starts tying it<br>
    again. He just can't get it right...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> RIKER ENTERS, also in a dress uniform. He's surprised<br>
    to see that Worf is not ready.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, they're going to be here any<br>
    minute.</p>
  <p> Worf tugs at his sash -- it's hopeless.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am having... problems.</p>
  <p> Riker moves over and starts to help him tie the sash.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If I didn't know you better, I'd<br>
    say you were procrastinating.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons do not procrastinate.</p>
  <p> Riker gives him a look, and Worf is forced to back down<br>
    a bit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It is a... tactical delay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (tying sash)<br>
    All you have to do is spend five<br>
    minutes greeting the Iyaarans and<br>
    another hour or so making small<br>
    talk at the reception. I'm the<br>
    one who has to spend the next<br>
    three days escorting them around<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not enjoy these diplomatic<br>
    situations.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all part of being in<br>
    Starfleet.<br>
    (ties sash)<br>
    There.</p>
  <p> They look in the mirror. Worf eyes his dress uniform --<br>
    the sash... the short-hemmed tunic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And I do not see why it is<br>
    necessary to wear these ridiculous<br>
    uniforms.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Protocol.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They look like... dresses.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, that is a remarkably<br>
    outmoded and sexist attitude. I'm<br>
    surprised at you.</p>
  <p> They head for the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Besides, you look great in a<br>
    dress.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. SHUTTLEBAY</p>
  <p> An ALIEN SHUTTLECRAFT sits in the bay. PICARD and TROI<br>
    (Picard in his jacket, carrying a duffel bag; Troi in<br>
    dress uniform;) are facing the shuttle. Riker and Worf<br>
    are also present. Clearly, this is a very important<br>
    moment for all of them. Except for Worf, who looks<br>
    distinctly uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> The shuttle doors OPEN and three distinctive-looking<br>
    aliens -- IYAARANS -- step out to greet the group.<br>
    AMBASSADOR LOQUEL... AMBASSADOR BYLETH... and the<br>
    shuttle's PILOT, VOVAL. All three wear featureless<br>
    clothing -- there are NO ornaments or extraneous<br>
    styling whatsoever -- it should suggest a purely<br>
    functional, utilitarian garment.</p>
  <p> Picard steps forward to greet the Ambassadors.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador Loquel... Ambassador<br>
    Byleth. I'm Captain Picard.<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The Ambassadors bow politely, a ceremonial gesture.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    It is our pleasure to be here,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are honored to be the site of<br>
    the first cultural exchange<br>
    between the Iyaaran people and the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Yes, yes. The next seven days<br>
    should prove most illuminating.</p>
  <p> Loquel gestures toward the pilot.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    Allow me to introduce Voval. He<br>
    will be taking you back to our<br>
    homeworld.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and smiles at the pilot.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pleased to meet you.</p>
  <p> The pilot stares back silently, a neutral expression on<br>
    his face. It throws Picard off for just a second, then --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Ambassadors)<br>
    I'm looking forward to meeting<br>
    with the Premier of Iyar.</p>
  <p>4 INLCUDE WORF</p>
  <p> as the diplomatic pleasantries continue. He is bored<br>
    stiff...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There will be a reception in your<br>
    honor where you'll meet the rest<br>
    of the Senior Staff. I'll be on<br>
    my way to your home world, of<br>
    course -- but I'm leaving you in<br>
    the hands of my most experienced<br>
    officers.</p>
  <p> He gestures toward Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, of the Klingon<br>
    Empire, is our head of security.<br>
    He will be responsible for your<br>
    safety while you're on board.</p>
  <p> Worf nods stiffly, and Byleth in particular takes<br>
    notice of him, staring intently. Picard moves on, but<br>
    Byleth continues to look at Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor Deanna Troi from the<br>
    Planet Betazed will be your<br>
    personal liaison, Ambassador<br>
    Loquel.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles and steps forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ambassador Loquel, it's an honor<br>
    to meet you. May I show you to<br>
    your quarters before we attend the<br>
    reception?</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> Loquel follows Troi toward the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And my First Officer, Commander<br>
    William Riker from the planet<br>
    Earth, will be assigned to you,<br>
    Ambassador Byleth.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (looking at Worf)<br>
    I want this one.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to this, puzzled and surprised. Picard<br>
    looks from one to the other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker is a skilled<br>
    diplomat, with wide experience in<br>
    inter-species contact --</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    I'm sure, I'm sure. But I have<br>
    decided. I want this Lieutenant<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf looks stricken... glances at Picard for<br>
    salvation... but Picard wants to accommodate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. That will be -- just fine.<br>
    Mister Worf... ?</p>
  <p> There's no out. Worf takes a breath, turns to Byleth.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... Ambassador, I would be<br>
    pleased to --</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (waving dismissal)<br>
    Yes, yes. Enough of that. Show<br>
    me to my quarters.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - TEASER 5A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> And he turns and stalks toward the door. Worf gives<br>
    one last desperate look toward Riker, then follows<br>
    Byleth. Riker exchanges a glance with Picard. This<br>
    should be interesting...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> The reception is in progress. Riker, Worf, Troi and<br>
    DATA are there with several other Starfleet Officers.<br>
    (They are still in their dress uniforms.) A large<br>
    BUFFET TABLE has been set-up -- it's topped with<br>
    various FOOD and DRINKS.</p>
  <p>7 ON TROI AND AMBASSADOR LOQUEL</p>
  <p> moving along the buffet table. Troi holds an empty<br>
    plate; Loquel also holds a plate, but his is piled high<br>
    with food. As they talk, he keeps putting more food<br>
    onto his plate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So first thing tomorrow, I thought<br>
    I'd take you on a tour... show you<br>
    the operational centers and the<br>
    residential decks of the ship.<br>
    Then after that, we could spend<br>
    some time discussing some of the<br>
    cultural underpinnings of your<br>
    society --</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    Are you going to eat?</p>
  <p> Troi stops.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> He gestures at her empty plate.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    You have no food on your plate.<br>
    Are you going to eat?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh... actually, I was waiting<br>
    until we got to the dessert tray.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, not entirely clear on the concept.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    &quot;Dessert... &quot; What is that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's something we eat after the<br>
    main course. It's usually very<br>
    sweet... usually very bad for<br>
    you. We eat it purely for<br>
    pleasure.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you ask me, it's the best part<br>
    of any meal.</p>
  <p> He considers this.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    My people eat only for<br>
    nourishment.</p>
  <p> Troi leads him to the DESSERT TRAY, which is filled<br>
    with various treats. Loquel looks on with fascination.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let me introduce you to some of my<br>
    favorites...<br>
    (indicates desserts)<br>
    Here we have peach cobbler with<br>
    whipped cream. Tarvokian powder<br>
    cake...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But over here -- this is my very<br>
    favorite.</p>
  <p> Troi indicates a dome-shaped confection half the size<br>
    of a bowling ball -- and completely covered with<br>
    chocolate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is a Ktarian Chocolate Puff.<br>
    I'm not exactly sure what's in<br>
    it... but I think there are at<br>
    least seventeen varieties of<br>
    chocolate inside.</p>
  <p> Troi takes a modest slice and puts it on her plate,<br>
    offers it to him. Loquel takes a small bite with his<br>
    fork... considers the taste... then reacts with intense<br>
    pleasure. He tries to find words to describe the<br>
    sensation...</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    It is... it is...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Delicious?</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    (smiles at the word)<br>
    &quot;Delicious... &quot;</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ambassador... I think we're going<br>
    to get along very well.</p>
  <p> She gestures toward a table.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Shall we?</p>
  <p> He nods. Troi moves toward the table to sit down.<br>
    Loquel eyes the dessert tray a moment, then innocently<br>
    picks up the entire platter of desserts and follows<br>
    Troi...</p>
  <p>8 WORF, BEVERLY AND AMBASSADOR BYLETH</p>
  <p> sitting at a table. They all have food in front of<br>
    them. Byleth takes a bite of his food, reacts with<br>
    disgust. He shoves his plate of food toward Worf.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    This is unacceptable.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am sorry if you do not care for<br>
    our --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Bring me new food. I require a<br>
    higher protein and enzymatic<br>
    content.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a beat, tries to hold his temper. Beverly<br>
    intercedes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Our custom in a situation like<br>
    this is to serve ourselves. It's<br>
    called a &quot;buffet,&quot; and usually<br>
    people prefer to choose --</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (to Worf, as if to a<br>
    child)<br>
    Bring... me... new... food.</p>
  <p> Worf rises stiffly as Beverly tries to reach Byleth.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Ambassador...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is all right, Doctor. I am<br>
    happy to bring more food.</p>
  <p> Worf moves off to the buffet table. He picks up a long<br>
    knife and begins cutting at some meat... going at it<br>
    with a decidedly violent sub-text. Data approaches.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    How is your diplomatic assignment<br>
    progressing so far?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (terse)<br>
    Fine.</p>
  <p> Data watches as Worf hacks at the meat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have found that in moments of<br>
    diplomatic tension, it is often<br>
    helpful to find elements of<br>
    commonality.</p>
  <p> Worf considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ambassador Byleth is...<br>
    demanding... temperamental...<br>
    rude...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (innocently)<br>
    You share all of those qualities<br>
    in abundance. Perhaps you should<br>
    build on your similarities.</p>
  <p> Worf shoots him an irritated look, grumbles and walks<br>
    off with the plate of food. OFF Data's look -- he was<br>
    only trying to help...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - ALIEN SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle seen in the Teaser, at impulse.</p>
  <p>10 INT. ALIEN SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> The Pilot (Voval) seen earlier is at the controls.<br>
    (There's a small INSIGNIA PIN on the Pilot's uniform at<br>
    the sternum. It should not call attention to itself in<br>
    any way.) Picard is sitting next to him, trying his<br>
    best to strike up a conversation with the man. It<br>
    isn't easy. The Pilot is unresponsive, apparently<br>
    uninterested in anything Picard has to say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... I understand your homeworld<br>
    has some of the most spectacular<br>
    crystal formations in the sector.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Pilot just grunts and stares straight ahead. An<br>
    awkward beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is there any place in particular<br>
    that you recommend I visit while<br>
    I'm there?</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Picard sees that a conversation with the man is all but<br>
    impossible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, well... what's our ETA?</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Seventeen hours, thirty-two<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts -- it's going to be a long trip. He<br>
    stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I'll go update my<br>
    itinerary...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward the rear of the shuttle. Suddenly --</p>
  <p> WHAM! The shuttle is JOLTED and all of the lights GO<br>
    OFF. EMERGENCY LIGHTS come up. Picard quickly sits<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> The Pilot scans the console.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    There has been a system wide power<br>

    Pilot is slumped over the controls, semi-conscious, a<br>
    nasty-looking WOUND on his forehead.</p>

  <p> Troi and Ambassador Loquel are walking along, mid-conversation.<br>
    Loquel is carrying a elaborate-looking<br>
    cup of orange-colored liquid with a straw sticking out<br>
    of it -- it looks like the 24th century equivalent of<br>
    a &quot;Big Gulp.&quot; Throughout the scene, he takes little<br>
    sips of it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This deck is devoted mainly to<br>
    stellar cartography, biological<br>
    research, and astrophysics...</p>
  <p> Loquel takes a sip of his drink and gives a little moan<br>
    of pleasure at the taste. He seems more interested in<br>
    the drink than anything else.</p>

    This... &quot;papalla juice?&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, thank you. I'm still<br>
    recovering from all those desserts<br>
    last night.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    Are you sure? It is very...<br>
    &quot;delicious.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> Loquel stops, again holds the drink out to Troi,<br>

    both hands at arm's length. He turns the boy from side<br>
    to side, staring at him with intense curiosity, as if<br>
    he's never seen a child before. The boy is staring<br>
    back at him with a startled expression on his face.</p>
  <p> The mother looks imploringly to Troi. Loquel glances<br>
    at Troi.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>

    What is this?</p>

    May I give Eric some dessert?</p>

  <p> It's a long, tunnel-like room, with a single door along<br>

    and several cargo containers, which are nothing more<br>

    a lovely smile.</p>

    It's been a long time.... since I<br>
    talked to anyone...</p>
  <p> A beat, then she sits down on a crate by the bed,<br>
    thoughtful.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I used to talk... to myself. But<br>
    then I thought... it might mean<br>
    that I was crazy. So I stopped<br>
    talking...</p>

    I can do that.</p>

    Good.<br>

    Go into the cockpit, and look for<br>
    a small com panel in the center of<br>
    the instrument bay. See if you<br>
    can remove it, and bring it to me.</p>
  <p> She nods, determined.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Stay in bed. I'll be back.</p>
  <p> She moves to the door... walks out side and shuts the<br>
    door. There's a beat, then the door opens again and<br>
    she walks inside the doorway and moves to him. She<br>
    lightly touches his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>

    I just... wanted to make sure you<br>

  <p>40 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Worf and Byleth are walking through the room, Worf<br>
    showing him around. GEORDI is working in the<br>
    background, as well as a couple of Engineering N.D.s.<br>
    Worf is trying his best to be polite. He indicates the<br>
    large back-wall graphic of the Enterprise.</p>

  <p> BYLETH<br>

    What is the mass flow rate of the<br>
    antimatter replenishment stream to<br>
    the containment pods?</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him, thrown off by the detailed technical<br>
    nature of the question.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me?</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    The antimatter replenishment rate.<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am... not certain of the exact<br>
    rate.</p>
  <p> Byleth glances around the room, impatient.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Perhaps there is someone here who<br>
    does know the answer.</p>

  <p> BYLETH<br>
    You. Are you smarter than this<br>
    one?</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Geordi, seething. Geordi hesitates, on<br>
    the spot, not sure how to respond -- there's no good<br>
    answer to this question.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ah... well... why do you ask?</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Never mind.</p>
  <p> Byleth walks off toward the warp core chamber, eyeing<br>
    it with interest. Worf takes a breath, then moves to<br>

    This way.</p>
  <p> Worf leads him onto the ELEVATOR. There is an awkward<br>

  <p> Worf paces around the room, wild-eyed, angry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have failed in my mission,<br>
    Commander. I am clearly a bad<br>

    request reassignment.</p>

    Denied.</p>

    What have you learned about him so<br>
    far?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He seems preoccupied with...<br>

    I've spent more time in Ten<br>
    Forward and the Holodeck than I<br>
    have in the past two months.<br>

    To be honest... he's even testing<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    (seizing on this)<br>
    You see? They are insane!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... you've been patient with<br>
    Ambassador Byleth, and that's<br>
    good. But maybe it's time to let<br>
    him know that some behavior is<br>
    unacceptable to us. I think it's<br>
    all right to suggest limits for<br>
    the Ambassador...</p>

  <p>43 INT. CARGO FREIGHTER</p>
  <p> It's hours later. Picard is lying on the cot, alone.<br>
    The fire is still burning. A quiet moment passes...<br>
    then Picard reaches for the cup of water -- it's empty.<br>
    He glances across the room, sees a large jug of water<br>
    sitting on the floor. He decides to get up...</p>
  <p> Slowly, painfully, he manages to get to an upright<br>
    position... hobbles out of bed and across the room to<br>
    the jug of water. The exertion is intense, he's<br>
    sweating... he takes a long drink of water then sets<br>
    down the jug...</p>
  <p> He looks around the cargo room... He carefully makes<br>
    his way to the door, trying not to jar his ribs too<br>
    severely. He grabs a handle on the door and tries to<br>
    open the hatch -- it won't budge. It's locked.</p>
  <p> He's definitely puzzled by this. He turns and looks<br>
    around for another exit, but there are no other doors.<br>
    As he considers, there is a CLANG of metal at the door,<br>
    and it swings open, letting in blast of WIND which<br>
    almost knocks Picard off his feet.</p>
  <p> Anna ENTERS. She's shocked to see him on his feet.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    What... what are you doing? Get<br>

    There are dangerous animals here.<br>

    I got the com panel... it's right<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> She moves to the door, opens it, comes back inside<br>

    If I can boost the output field,<br>

  <p> Picard eyes the charred circuitry a moment... then sets<br>
    down the com device. He looks at her, wanting an<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did this happen? It looks as<br>
    though it's been hit by a phaser<br>

    No.</p>

  <p> ANNA<br>

    At first, I kept hoping that I'd<br>

    There's a precipice near here...<br>
    I used to go there and stare down<br>
    into the gorge... and think... I<br>
    could just step off... and it<br>
    would all be over...<br>

    Then I realized... it was the hope<br>
    that was driving me crazy... I had<br>

    helps Picard back into the chair. As she lays him<br>
    down, she leans in close and gently strokes the side of<br>

    closing, mouth parting... and she kisses him tenderly<br>

  <p>47 INT. CARGO FREIGHTER</p>
  <p> It's a few hours later. Picard is standing on top of<br>
    a cargo container, working at an OPENED PANEL on the<br>
    wall. He's trying to dismantle a COMPONENT (A POWER<br>
    CELL) from its position in the circuitry.</p>
  <p> After a moment, the door opens and Anna ENTERS. She's<br>
    carrying a small SACK. Her appearance has changed.<br>
    She has cleaned herself up quite a bit, and her hair is<br>
    tied back in a simple but pretty style. Clearly, she<br>
    has made an effort to be more attractive.</p>
  <p> She doesn't see Picard at first.</p>

  <p> Picard yanks out the power cell. He gingerly steps<br>
    down off the container, wincing at the pain in his<br>
    side. Anna helps him down, and he sets the cell on a<br>
    table and sits down in the chair. He starts examining<br>

    He has no choice but to confront the issue head on now.<br>
    He doesn't want to hurt her feelings, but it must be<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Look... sometimes when a person<br>
    has gone through a traumatic<br>
    experience, like yours... they<br>
    come to look upon the person who<br>
    rescues them as a sort of...<br>
    larger than life figure.<br>
    Sometimes they become infatuated<br>
    with their rescuer. They may even<br>
    think that... they're in love with<br>
    that person...</p>
  <p> Anna thinks about this a moment.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    So... you're not attracted to me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's not true. You're a very<br>
    lovely woman. I just think this<br>
    is... a little premature. We<br>
    don't know anything about each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> Anna looks away... grows very thoughtful... and finally<br>
    seems to yield a little.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    I understand... and I'm sorry if<br>
    I made you uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's all right.</p>
  <p> He picks up the tricorder and works it a moment. He<br>
    aims the tricorder at the power cell and hits a control --<br>
    the power cell HUMS and starts to GLOW. Picard looks<br>
    pleased.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It'll take a couple of hours for<br>

    a table in that order, playing five card draw. The<br>
    Ambassadors are clearly new at the game. Loquel is<br>
    eating from a small plate of chocolate candy, which he<br>
    keeps nibbling on during the scene.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll bet ten.</p>
  <p> Riker tosses in a chip. He looks to Loquel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ambassador, the bet goes to you...</p>
  <p> Loquel considers his cards, which are smudged with<br>
    chocolate.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    I will... &quot;see&quot; the bet.<br>
    (excited)<br>
    And I will... &quot;raise&quot; ten.</p>
  <p> He tosses in two chips.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's twenty to me...</p>
  <p> Troi tosses in two chips. Worf studies his cards a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'm in. And I raise twenty.</p>
  <p> He tosses in four chips.</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    You are -- you are...<br>
    (finds the word)<br>
    ...bluffing.</p>
  <p> Worf shoots him a look. Quickly and with feeling,<br>
    Byleth tosses four chips into the pile -- but Worf<br>
    notices that Byleth surreptitiously takes two of them<br>
    from Worf's pile!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Byleth)<br>
    Excuse me, Ambassador. Those are<br>
    my chips.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    You are in error. Those chips are<br>
    mine.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I saw you take two chips from my<br>
    pile.</p>
  <p> Byleth's eyes widen. He stands.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    You dare to accuse me of stealing?</p>
  <p> Worf stands and faces him, glaring.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    You are lying because you are<br>
    losing the game!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps I am losing because you've<br>
    been cheating all along!</p>
  <p> It looks like this might come to blows.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait a minute, let's just calm<br>
    down...</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (ignoring Riker)<br>
    Even if I were cheating, how would<br>
    a plodding animal like you know<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    You are an insulting, pompous<br>
    fool! If you were not an<br>
    Ambassador, I would disembowel you<br>
    right here!</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Do not let my title inhibit you,<br>
    Klingon!</p>
  <p> Byleth gives Worf a little SHOVE. Worf's eyes widen<br>
    with rage -- that's it. He GRABS Byleth and THROWS HIM<br>
    into the wall.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Worf -- stop! That's<br>
    an order!</p>
  <p> Worf tries to restrain himself, though he's trembling<br>
    with rage. Byleth looks at him -- suddenly very<br>
    pleased.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Yes! Good!</p>
  <p> Without warning, he KICKS Worf backward, sending him<br>
    slamming against the wall. Worf is enraged. The two<br>
    men FIGHT -- each of them getting off a PUNCH or two<br>
    before Riker finally GRABS Worf and holds him back.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (recovering)<br>
    Wonderful... very good!</p>
  <p> Everyone looks at him.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant Worf. I<br>
    think I understand now. That was<br>
    a very effective demonstration.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him in astonishment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    If you will excuse me, I would<br>
    like to document this experience.</p>

  <p> Byleth swiftly EXITS. Riker, Worf and Troi exchange a<br>
    confused look... then they to Loquel, who is sitting in<br>
    his chair, eating a piece of chocolate. He looks up at<br>
    them and smiles.</p>
  <p> OFF their mystified reactions...</p>

  <p> A while later. Picard is working on the power cell,<br>
    which is still humming and glowing. Anna sits nearby,<br>
    quietly watching him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The power cell's ready. We need<br>
    to get to the shuttle...</p>
  <p> She tenses.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    We can't go right now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    The plasma storms are too<br>
    strong... it's dangerous. Wait<br>
    a few hours... then we'll go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We don't have a few hours. I told<br>
    you, the cell's already<br>
    degrading...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FOUR 52.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Anna moves to him, gently tries to convince him to<br>
    stay.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Jean-Luc... it's a difficult<br>
    journey... The restriction field<br>
    will make it hard for you to<br>
    walk...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm feeling much better now. And<br>
    I don't intend to use this any<br>
    longer...</p>
  <p> He pulls aside his shirt and reaches for the device,<br>
    but Anna quickly stops him.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No... you can't remove it yet --</p>
  <p> Picard pulls away from her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Anna.</p>
  <p> She stops. Picard reaches for the device, and his hand<br>
    is jolted back as it emits an ENERGY FIELD.<br>
    Determined, Picard grabs the device. He winces at the<br>
    pain as the FIELD FLASHES ON AND OFF for a moment --<br>
    then he pulls off the device.</p>
  <p> He looks down. There is no wound on the side of his<br>
    body -- no sutures, nothing. Picard takes a deep<br>
    breath and moves around his arm experimentally. There<br>
    is no pain. He slowly looks up at Anna... realizing...<br>
    putting everything together... very suspicious now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's no pain. It would seem<br>
    that my ribs weren't broken after<br>
    all...</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    What the hell's going on? Why are<br>
    you trying to keep me here?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FOUR 53.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Please... I love you...</p>
  <p> Picard ignores the remark -- presses on, wanting<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do you keep me locked inside<br>
    this freighter? You say there are<br>
    dangerous animals... but I've yet<br>
    to see or hear a single one of<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what about that com panel?<br>
    You said you damaged it while<br>
    cutting it out of the shuttle...<br>
    Did you? I find it hard to<br>
    believe you would be that clumsy<br>
    with the one piece of equipment<br>
    that could save you after seven<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> Picard holds up the device.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    And what was this really for... to<br>
    keep me immobilized?</p>
  <p> Anna is frightened. She backs away, starting to break<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Please... I was so afraid... I<br>
    didn't want you to leave me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So you found it necessary to hold<br>
    me captive?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FOUR 54.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    I was scared... I wanted you to<br>
    stay... to love me...</p>
  <p> She starts to cry softly. Picard eyes her a moment,<br>
    decides not to encourage her feelings in any way. He<br>
    sits down and starts preparing the power cell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm going to go find that shuttle<br>
    myself...</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Anna's face fills with intense emotion and she rushes<br>
    at him, wraps her arms around his neck and shoulders --<br>
    pulls him close and kisses him passionately. Picard<br>
    pulls away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna...</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Don't fight me...</p>
  <p> She kisses him again, this time more insistently.<br>
    Picard reaches up, takes her arms and firmly pulls her<br>
    away and breaks the kiss.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna, no.</p>
  <p> A look comes over Anna's face -- puzzled, disturbed...<br>
    and vaguely threatened.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    You should love me now. We're<br>
    together... we depend on each<br>
    other... I know more about you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Love me.</p>
  <p> Anna forcefully throws him back onto the ground. She<br>
    grabs his face and forces herself on him, kissing him<br>
    with a strange ferocity. The moment builds, then --</p>
  <p> Picard manages to THROW her off of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop it!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FOUR 55.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Anna looks at him for a moment... confused... hurt...<br>
    and then her face changes. She looks suddenly very<br>
    serious.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    I failed... you don't love me...<br>
    it's over...</p>
  <p> She turns and races for the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna, wait... where are you going?</p>
  <p> Picard moves to grab her, but she pulls away. As it<br>
    happens, Picard's hand catches her necklace and it<br>
    BREAKS away from her neck as it pulls into his hand.</p>
  <p> Anna quickly EXITS. The door slams shut.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna!</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the door, dropping the necklace by the<br>
    fire. He tries to open the door, but it's locked. He<br>
    thinks, looks around the room, picks up a metal bar and<br>
    starts to work at the door, trying to force it open...</p>
  <p> He works for a moment... then there's the sound of<br>
    heavy FOOTSTEPS outside. Picard stops, listens... the<br>
    steps come closer... and then a MAN'S VOICE:</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    (calling out)<br>
    Hello! Is anyone in there?</p>
  <p> PICARD looks to the wall opposite the door, following<br>
    the voice.</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Over here! There's a door on the<br>
    opposite side!</p>
  <p> The footsteps pause... then start moving around the<br>
    freighter. Picard pounds a fist on the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Over here! The door's over here!</p>

  <p> A couple of beats... then there's the sound of the door<br>
    being unbolted from outside. The door opens to reveal:</p>

  <p>52 INT. CARGO FREIGHTER</p>
  <p> Continuous action. Picard and the Pilot looking at one<br>
    another in surprise. (NOTE: The small insignia pin<br>
    seen earlier on the Pilot's sternum is now gone -- this<br>
    is a subtlety that neither we nor Picard should<br>
    notice.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Voval...</p>
  <p> The Pilot enters and Picard shuts the door. The Pilot<br>
    is tired, but he looks okay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I thought you were dead...</p>
  <p> The Pilot looks at him.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Dead?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. There's a woman who lives<br>
    here... she went to the shuttle...<br>
    she told me you were dead...</p>
  <p> The Pilot realizes what must have happened.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Yes... that is understandable...<br>
    (explains)<br>
    When my species is injured, our<br>
    metabolic rate slows until our<br>
    body can heal itself...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This state could easily be<br>
    mistaken for death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> The Pilot shivers a little, cold -- and he moves to the<br>
    fire and begins to warm himself. Anna's necklace is<br>
    visible on the floor next to the fire.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    When you did not return to the<br>
    shuttle... I attempted to track<br>
    you.<br>

    The surface conditions made it<br>
    very difficult...<br>

    So cold...</p>
  <p> The Pilot glances toward the door, concerned.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    I saw someone running away from<br>
    here... was it the woman?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Why would she leave this shelter?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She was upset.</p>
  <p> The Pilot considers this -- he looks worried.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Do you think she might... harm<br>
    herself?<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    There's a dangerous precipice near<br>
    here... she was headed in that<br>
    direction...</p>
  <p> Picard eyes the Pilot, curious at the statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's possible...</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Then we should go find her.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard is a little suspicious of the Pilot's<br>
    urgency to find her, but he decides to play this out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right. You stay here -- warm<br>
    yourself. I'll go look for her...</p>
  <p> The Pilot moves to join him.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    We will go together.</p>

    looks into the darkness below with concern.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Captain -- this ridge extends for<br>
    a kilometer in either direction.<br>
    I suggest we separate -- we can<br>
    search it twice as fast.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna!</p>
  <p> He keeps walking for a moment... then he sees something --</p>
  <p>58 PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Visible in the distance, standing near the edge of the<br>
    cliff -- is Anna. She's staring down into the chasm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Anna...</p>
  <p> Picard quickly makes his way to her. Anna does not<br>
    even look up at him. She's despondent.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Get away from me...</p>
  <p> Picard stops several feet away from her. He eyes her<br>
    a moment, not sure whether she's willing to carry out<br>
    her threat. But he's determined to find out what's<br>
    really going on... and he tries to draw out her true<br>
    intentions...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't have to do this. I<br>
    found Voval, the shuttle pilot --<br>
    he's still alive. He can help us<br>
    get away...</p>

  <p> Anna shifts her weight to one leg, and her body sways<br>

    No... no, I won't promise that.<br>
    You've been manipulating me,<br>
    haven't you?</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Jean-Luc, what are you saying?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your necklace. I broke it. It<br>
    was lying in the cargo freighter,<br>
    by the fire... I left it there.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now it's whole again and back on<br>
    your neck. How?</p>
  <p> She ignores the inquiry.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Tell me about your love... I must<br>
    know...</p>

  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where's Voval? Isn't it<br>
    convenient that he arrived at the<br>
    freighter only moments after you<br>
    left... and then he insisted that<br>
    I come looking for you. He took<br>
    me here to the ledge... where I<br>
    found you... on the cliff, about<br>
    to jump. Very well-timed,<br>
    wouldn't you say?</p>
  <p> Anna steps dangerously close to the ledge.</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you working together? Voval's<br>

    you...</p>
  <p> ANNA<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Tell me about your love -- or I<br>

    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> She blinks, unsure how to react to that statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What are you waiting for? It's a<br>
    long fall... at least two hundred<br>
    meters. You should die<br>
    instantly... if that's what you<br>
    really want.</p>
  <p> She glances down into chasm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But somehow, I don't think it is.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Anna's expression fades to resignation.<br>
    She steps away from the ledge... and touches the<br>
    pendant on her necklace --</p>

  <p>60 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ANNA TRANSFORMS INTO THE PILOT, VOVAL. The necklace is<br>
    now gone, and in its place we see that Voval is<br>
    touching the small insignia pin at his sternum, which<br>
    is actually an alien holographic projection device.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    I have failed.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, trying to understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Failed. Voval... what was the<br>
    purpose of all this?</p>
  <p> Voval looks disappointed.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    My name is Ambassador Voval.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador...</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    My mission was to study human<br>
    intimacy... specifically the<br>
    concept you call love...</p>
  <p> Picard is astonished.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You staged the crash... faked my<br>
    injury... and arranged all this to<br>
    see if I would fall in love with<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (innocently)<br>
    In our study of your culture, we<br>
    did not understand certain<br>
    concepts. So we sent three<br>
    representatives to study them...<br>
    to experience them...</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What gave you the idea that<br>
    trapping me here would give you<br>
    the opportunity to explore love?</p>
  <p> The Pilot gestures at the environment.</p>

    ship contained logs made by a<br>
    single survivor -- a human woman.<br>
    That was our first contact with<br>
    human culture...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The woman lived alone here for<br>
    seven years... until another human<br>
    crashed on this planet. A human<br>
    male...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    And that man was injured... the<br>
    woman nursed him back to health...<br>
    they fell in love...</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (nods)<br>
    In the logs, she described many<br>
    concepts we found difficult to<br>
    understand. Pleasure...<br>
    antagonism... love. These were<br>
    alien to us. We wished to<br>
    experience them ourselves.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ambassador Loquel was sent to<br>
    experience pleasure... Byleth was<br>
    sent to experience antagonism.<br>
    And I was sent to experience...<br>
    love. Was this wrong?</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment -- it all makes sense now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... let's just say that we're<br>
    not used to such a... direct<br>
    approach.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ambassador Voval... I must tell<br>
    you that in our culture, what<br>
    you've done would be considered<br>
    dangerously close to a crime.</p>
  <p> Voval looks at him in confusion.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (tries the word)<br>
    &quot;Crime... &quot;?</p>
  <p> Picard sees that they have a big gulf to cover.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FIVE 65.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can... talk about that later.</p>
  <p> Picard looks around the rough terrain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The first order of business would<br>
    seem to be getting off this<br>
    planet. Am I to assume the<br>
    shuttle is not as badly damaged as<br>
    it looked?</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    That is correct. I only simulated<br>
    the crash. We can leave at any<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then let's go...</p>
  <p> As they turn and walk off across the rough terrain...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>61 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>62 INT. SHUTTLEBAY</p>
  <p> The Iyaaran shuttlecraft is sitting in the bay with its<br>
    doors open. Picard and Voval are getting out -- Picard<br>
    in his jacket, carrying his duffel bag. They have just<br>
    returned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/09/93 - ACT FIVE 66.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Troi, Loquel and Byleth are ENTERING the<br>
    room together, saying their goodbyes. The mood is<br>
    upbeat. As they make their way to the shuttle...</p>
  <p>63 RIKER, WORF AND BYLETH</p>
  <p> walking along, mid-conversation. Byleth is fine, but<br>
    Worf is rubbing his back and shoulders, clearly in a<br>
    great deal of pain. Riker takes note.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    You seem a little sore...</p>
  <p> Worf nods and groans a little.</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    (explains)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf was kind enough to<br>
    engage me in eleven hours of<br>
    Holodeck battle exercises.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Eleven hours...</p>
  <p> BYLETH<br>
    I learned a great deal about the<br>
    concept of antagonism.</p>
  <p> Worf smiles at the memory.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It was... excruciating.</p>
  <p>64 TROI AND LOQUEL</p>
  <p> stop at the shuttlecraft. Loquel turns to face Troi<br>
    and hands her a stack of plain brown WAFERS.</p>
  <p> LOQUEL<br>
    (re: wafers)<br>
    Counselor, these are bio-enzymatic<br>
    supplements that my people consume<br>
    for food. I'm afraid you will<br>
    find they are not as...<br>
    delicious... as your chocolate.</p>
  <p> Troi takes the wafers and smiles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - REV. 07/07/93 - ACT FIVE 67.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    After the past few days... I could<br>
    use something a little bland.</p>
  <p> As Loquel returns her smile...</p>
  <p>65 PICARD AND VOVAL</p>
  <p> standing at the shuttle, face-to-face.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Thank you, Captain. This has been<br>
    an enlightening experience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For me as well, Ambassador.</p>
  <p> Voval frowns a little.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    And I am sorry if our...<br>
    diplomatic methods offended you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the contrary. I found your<br>
    approach... intriguing.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    We humans tend to take a rather...<br>
    balanced approach to life. Never<br>
    too much, never too little. It's<br>
    nice to find a culture that's<br>
    willing to take an experience to<br>
    its furthest extremes.</p>
  <p> Voval smiles.</p>
  <p> VOVAL<br>
    Goodbye, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Liaisons&quot; - 07/06/93 - ACT FIVE 68.</p>
  <p>66 WIDE ON EVERYONE</p>
  <p> as Voval, Loquel and Byleth bow ceremoniously. Picard<br>
    joins Riker, Worf and Troi, and they all bow in return.<br>
    It's a warm moment.</p>
  <p> The three Ambassadors turn to board their shuttlecraft.<br>
    OFF the proud faces of Picard, Riker, Worf and Troi...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
