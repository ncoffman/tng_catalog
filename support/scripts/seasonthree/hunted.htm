  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Hunted&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. ANGOSIAN CAPITOL - ESTABLISHING (MATTE)</p>
  <p> A cluster of low buildings, a bud of civilization whose<br>
    outlying roadways vein a vast plain.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43489.2.<br>
    We have arrived at Angosia, a<br>
    planet that is eager for<br>
    membership in the Federation.</p>
  <p>2 EXT. ANGOSIAN SENATE</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are with NAYROK, the Angosian leader,<br>
    in the rotunda of the senate building. The Angosians<br>
    take their civic duty very seriously and the senate is<br>
    considered a repository of wisdom and law. Various<br>
    government officials and petitioners pass by, either<br>
    in deep discussion or thoughtful meditation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm greatly impressed with what<br>
    I've seen so far, Prime Minister.</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    Then I hope it will reflect<br>
    favorably in your report, Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a tribute to your people to<br>
    have recovered so rapidly from<br>
    the Tarsian War.</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    It is indeed.<br>
    (sadly)<br>
    We are not warriors. We believe<br>
    reason can settle disputes. But<br>
    not every culture agrees with our<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An unfortunate reality.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - REV. 10/27/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    The development of the mind, the<br>
    cultivation of the intellect --<br>
    these are the pursuits to which<br>
    the Angosians have dedicated<br>
    themselves for centuries.</p>
  <p> Nayrok nods and is about to respond... but is<br>
    interrupted by ZAYNAR, an aide who casually interrupts.</p>
  <p> ZAYNAR<br>
    I'm sorry to interrupt, Prime<br>
    Minister. There's a problem.<br>
    May I see you a moment?</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE --</p>
  <p> on Picard and Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think they'll make a fine<br>
    addition to the Federation, Number<br>
    One...</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges, but without enthusiasm. Off<br>
    Picard's look...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure I'd want to live<br>
    here. A little stuffy for my<br>
    taste.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks it over, nods slightly. It's a little<br>
    dry for his taste, too.</p>
  <p>4 ANOTHER ANGLE --</p>
  <p> Nayrok returns, his face has a look of concern...</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    A prisoner has escaped from the<br>
    penal colony on Lunar Five.<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    Two guards are dead. The prisoner<br>
    has taken a transport vessel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - REV. 10/27/89 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you have means of pursuit?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    The tracking station was<br>
    sabotaged. The entire base is<br>
    in chaos. We have ordered ships<br>
    from the surface to follow him,<br>
    but to be honest, our civilian<br>
    pilots are not trained to handle<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With your permission, sir... ?</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keying his insignia)<br>
    Mister Data, a stolen transport<br>
    vessel has departed from Lunar<br>
    Five. Have you picked it up on<br>
    sensors?</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is in command. GEORDI, WORF, and WESLEY are on<br>
    the bridge. Supernumeraries.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (checking sensors)<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good. Detain the vessel and<br>
    quarantine the pilot.<br>
    (to Nayrok)<br>
    Is he armed?</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    Yes. And he's very dangerous,<br>
    Captain. Lunar Five is our<br>
    maximum security facility.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you hear that, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Commander, we will use<br>
    extreme caution.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Keep us informed. Riker out.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    On screen, sir...</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>6 ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A small ship, as well as an asteroid, are visible in<br>
    front of the planet.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Specifications on the vessel,<br>
    Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No warp drive. Minimal weaponry.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Heading, Ensign Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Three-one-nine mark<br>
    two-five-zero.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Vessel's speed increasing to<br>
    point-two impulse. He's seen us,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moving toward the transport vessel... which disappears<br>
    behind the asteroid.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the main viewscreen, we see that only a small piece<br>
    of the ship appears on the other side of the asteroid.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    The ship's drive section...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What happened to the rest of his<br>
    ship?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scan the drive section for life<br>
    form readings.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    None.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mister Crusher, bring us around<br>
    to the back side of the asteroid.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sensors indicate wreckage on the<br>
    asteroid's surface.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No life signs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently, he did not survive.</p>
  <p> Wesley, puzzled, is checking his console... and he<br>
    looks surprised.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data, the drive section...<br>
    where'd it go?</p>
  <p>8A ANGLE - MAIN VIEW SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Only the asteroid remains on screen. The ship is<br>
    gone. Data reacts... looks at his sensors... looks at<br>
    the screen.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There's no sign of it on its<br>
    previous heading. Someone must<br>
    be at the helm.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Status report, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> There's no beating around this bush.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>8A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (simply)<br>
    I am afraid the prisoner has eluded<br>
    us, sir.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker have returned, are listening to Data's<br>
    explanation. Other personnel are there as before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We followed procedures precisely.<br>
    Scanners indicated no life forms<br>
    present in the drive section.<br>
    I cannot explain how he escaped.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Incoming message from the Angosian<br>
    prime minister.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (settling into the<br>
    Command Chair)<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The planet's surface is replaced by an image of<br>
    Nayrok, seated in his office.</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>
    We've identified the prisoner,<br>
    Captain. His name is Roga Danar.<br>
    His criminal record is too long<br>
    to go into. But you must be aware<br>
    that he is given to bouts of<br>
    uncontrollable violence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We appreciate the warning, Prime<br>
    Minister. We will keep you posted<br>
    on our progress.</p>
  <p> The image on the viewscreen returns to planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister La Forge, how far and how<br>
    fast can that transport ship<br>
    travel?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Without warp drive, there's no<br>
    way it could be outside our range<br>
    by now.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We've been sweeping the area<br>
    constantly, Commander. There's<br>
    nothing within sensor range.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns, frustrated. This annoying little space<br>
    gnat is turning out to be more than they bargained for.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A cloaking device?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Angosians have no cloaking<br>
    technology...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (it dawns on him)<br>
    Unless he's borrowing one...<br>
    (off Picard's look)<br>
    If he's hanging over the planet's<br>
    pole, its magnetic field could<br>
    confuse the sensors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I can recalibrate our<br>
    sensors to read through the<br>
    electromagnetic interference over<br>
    the poles, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Realign for polar orbit.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data sits, his fingers dance over the keys on the<br>
    console. He looks at</p>
  <p>11 HIS MONITOR - COMPUTER GRAPHIC</p>
  <p> of the planet, over the north pole, we can see magnetic<br>
    interference which Data tunes out, revealing an image<br>
    of a craft hovering there, hiding...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There he is, Commander. You were<br>
    correct.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The fellow knows all the tricks,<br>
    doesn't he...</p>
  <p> Data studies his console, confused.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are still no life form<br>
    readings coming from the vessel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It could be the magnetic<br>
    interference, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have compensated. There are no<br>
    readings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll have our answer shortly.<br>
    Lock on tractor beam, Mister La<br>
    Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Tractor beam locking on.</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The tractor beam shoots out from the Enterprise towards<br>
    the tiny half-ship, which begins to turn to face the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>14 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data checks his instruments.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the vessel is coming about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (looking over his<br>
    shoulder)<br>
    Is he out of his mind?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors detect a massive power<br>
    build up in his aft thrusters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On Main Viewer, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p>15 ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The tiny ship is now facing the Enteprise. It is<br>
    slowly approaching within the tractor beam.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's making a suicide run.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Shields have been automatically<br>
    activated. Tractor beam<br>
    disengaged.</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE TRANSPORT VESSEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> No longer enveloped in the tractor beam, the transport<br>
    vessel hurtles head on towards the Enterprise, then<br>
    skids off the invisible shield, away from the ship.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    He's bounced off our shields.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's one trick I didn't even<br>
    know about...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Crusher, fix coordinates<br>
    of that vessel. We'll transport<br>
    the whole thing to a shuttlebay<br>
    if we have to.</p>
  <p> Data has been working hard the whole time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not think that will be<br>
    necessary, Captain. He is no<br>
    longer in the drive section.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - 10/25/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    (reactions)<br>
    I anticipated this diversionary<br>
    tactic based on his pattern to<br>
    date. We are picking up a<br>
    cylindrical object approximately<br>
    seven meters in length and three<br>
    meters in diameter.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    On screen, Captain.</p>
  <p>18 ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A tiny, cylindrical object is just visible.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    An escape pod.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This guy is incredible.</p>
  <p>19 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Yet there are still no life form<br>
    readings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room Four, prepare<br>
    to beam aboard anything that's<br>
    large enough to be a humanoid<br>
    adult from inside that pod.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Security to Transporter Room Four.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S VOICE<br>
    We are holding the contents in<br>
    stasis pending arrival of<br>
    security. An illicit weapon has<br>
    been detected in the transport<br>
    beam, sir. It's been rendered<br>
    inoperable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Let's greet our guest.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - REV. 10/27/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf disappear into the turbolift.</p>
  <p>20 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> TWO ARMED SECURITY OFFICERS wait with the transporter<br>
    engineer. All eyes and weapons are trained on</p>
  <p>21 THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It glitters to life. An image begins to materialize.<br>
    ROGA DANAR stands before them. Haggard. On the edge.<br>
    A dangerous gleam to his eye, like a frightened,<br>
    trapped animal. Without wasting a second, Roga aims<br>
    his rifle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.</p>
  <p> SECURITY MAN<br>
    Just stay where you are.</p>
  <p> Roga barely reacts... with the quickness of a snake<br>
    striking, he lunges off the transporter pad...</p>
  <p>22 WIDE - THE SECURITY MEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> fire their phasers... he's so quick, one shot misses<br>
    him... the other connects with him in mid-air but he<br>
    still lands on the security guard, takes him out,<br>
    rolling off him, hit by another phaser shot, growls<br>
    with pain, sags, then pulls himself back up and leaps<br>
    at the second guard...</p>
  <p>23 INT. TRANSPORTER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> They come crashing through from the Transporter Room...<br>
    Roga and the guard wrapped up together, fighting for<br>
    control of the guard's phaser... the transporter<br>
    engineer comes from behind, grabs Roga... who throws<br>
    him backwards hard against the wall...</p>
  <p>24 WORF AND RIKER</p>
  <p> arrive...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What the hell...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Hunted&quot; - REV. 10/27/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf charge Roga... it's like two<br>
    linebackers trying to bring down a powerful running<br>

  <p> NAYROK<br>
    We need a few hours to get the<br>

  <p> NAYROK<br>
    I appreciate your patience. Our<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Commander. There is nothing<br>
    wrong with the ship's sensors.<br>
    The reason that we did not sense<br>
    any life signs aboard the escape<br>

    has no life signs.</p>

  <p>28A CLOSE ON ROGA</p>

    his bed, recuperating from the demons of his<br>
    subconscious, turns to see Troi standing there outside<br>
    the divider. For a beat, he has to shake himself back<br>
    to reality... their eyes meet.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> He stares at her, considers the question... and may<br>
    not be entirely sure of the answer. Surprisingly,<br>
    Roga's manner is calm and circumspect, the antithesis<br>
    of the labels he has been given. There is no sign of<br>
    the violent nature he displayed in the Transporter<br>
    Room. If anything, he is detatched and cerebral.</p>
  <p> He stands, looks around, disoriented.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Roga Danar was an idealistic young<br>
    man who answered his people's call<br>
    to service. He joined the<br>
    military to fight for the Angosian<br>
    way of life. He didn't realize<br>
    that by doing so... he would<br>
    forever have to give up that way<br>
    of life. He's not the same man<br>
    who left home to go to war. He's<br>
    been through intense psychological<br>
    manipulation as well as<br>
    biochemical modifications.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    At Troi's request I examined<br>
    him... his cellular structure<br>
    has been been significantly<br>

    He has been programmed to be the<br>
    perfect soldier. He can be<br>

    a danger is perceived, the<br>

  <p> NAYROK<br>
    Captain, I assure you all<br>
    alternatives have been explored.<br>
    And this discussion is now<br>
    treading upon matters of Angosian<br>
    security. This is not your<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> Picard cannot argue.</p>
  <p> NAYROK<br>

    I have dispatched a ship to<br>

    You did that? Perhaps you would<br>
