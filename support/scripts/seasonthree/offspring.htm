  <p> standing stationary in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43657.0<br>
    We have arrived at sector four-eight-seven<br>
    to begin charting this<br>
    region of the galaxy. Commander<br>
    Riker has been spared this<br>
    sometimes tedious duty by virtue<br>
    of a long overdue personal leave.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> GEORDI and WESLEY walking swiftly down the corridor.<br>
    At a connecting juncture TROI joins them. They are<br>
    surprised when they realize they are all headed in the<br>
    same direction.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Did he send for you too?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes... he was very mysterious<br>
    about it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Does anyone have any idea what<br>
    this is all about?</p>
  <p> They all exchange a long look, &quot;nope, not a clue&quot;, and<br>
    continue walking.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Something happened at that<br>
    cybernetics conference. Since<br>
    he's come back he's spent every<br>
    off duty minute in that lab.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is very unlike Data to be<br>
    secretive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - 12/19/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And cautious. He kept the lab<br>
    locked.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now how would you know that?</p>
  <p> Wesley reacts with a shrug and a grin. He's been<br>
    caught. They continue walking until they reach the<br>
    door to Data's lab. Ring the chime. After a beat, the<br>
    door slides open and Data stands there, holding a<br>
    &quot;human&quot; foot in his hand...</p>
  <p>3 INT. LABORATORY - REVERSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> The trio react to the foot...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Oh, you are early. Just a moment<br>
    please.</p>
  <p> And the door slides closed in their faces... moving<br>
    with Data as he takes his foot... and without ever<br>
    going wide enough to see exactly what he's doing...</p>
  <p>3A ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data kneels down and attaches the foot to the bottom of<br>
    a leg. The toes begin to wiggle. Data's face is<br>
    satisfied. He stands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may enter now.</p>
  <p> The door slides open and Data's curious crewmates<br>
    ENTER.</p>
  <p>3B NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> (and the lab must be arranged so we can have a reveal<br>
    here... we don't want them to see it as soon as they<br>
    walk in -- perhaps the biobed set-up is faced away from<br>
    the door, allows us to screen off line of sight to Lal<br>
    as they enter.)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    C'mon, Data, what is this...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/28/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah, what's going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have invited you here to meet<br>
    someone.</p>
  <p> And now he reveals... an android, but it has no face,<br>
    metallic eyes, and no hair. It is a primitive<br>
    mannequin. When it speaks, its voice is computer-like,<br>
    neither male nor female.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is Lal. Lal, say hello to<br>
    Counselor Deanna Troi...</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Hello... Counselor Deanna Troi...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How do you do, Lal.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    I am functioning... within normal<br>
    parameters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And this is Geordi La Forge and<br>
    Wesley Crusher.</p>
  <p> Lal examines them.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Purpose for... exterior drapings,<br>
    Father?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (sotto, to Geordi)<br>
    Father?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/20/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the custom that we wear<br>
    clothing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It called you &quot;Father&quot;, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Wesley. Lal is my child.</p>
  <p> On reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>4 INT. LABORATORY</p>
  <p> Picard, has joined them, slowly circles the android<br>
    while Troi, Geordi, Wesley and Data watch. The android<br>
    shows nothing. It stands ramrod straight and perfectly<br>
    still, and it displays no curiosity about the human<br>
    which is inspecting it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It has a positronic brain... one<br>
    very similar to my own... I began<br>
    to program it at the cybernetics<br>
    conference...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But nobody's ever been able to<br>
    do that... at least not since you<br>
    were programmed Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There was a new submicron matrix-transfer<br>
    technology introduced<br>
    at the conference which I<br>
    discovered could be used to lay<br>
    down complex neural net<br>
    pathways...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    You mean a transfer... from your<br>
    your brain to Lal's...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly, Wesley. I realized for<br>
    the very first time it was possible<br>
    to continue Doctor Soong's work.<br>
    My initial transfers have produced<br>
    very encouraging results... so I<br>
    brought Lal's brain back with me<br>
    to continue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (unhappy)<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> He pauses as he realizes this is not the time and place<br>
    to confont him. Suppresses his anger...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/28/89 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would like to have been<br>
    consulted.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have not observed anyone else<br>
    on board consult with you about<br>
    their procreation, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/20/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, but...</p>
  <p> He exchanges a look with Troi...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... in your case... it's not quite<br>
    the same.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The intention is the same.</p>
  <p> A beat... he sees Picard is not convinced.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lal's creation is entirely<br>
    dependent on me. I am giving it<br>
    knowledge and skills that are<br>
    stored in my brain... its<br>
    programming reflects mine in the<br>
    same way a human child's genes<br>
    reflect its parent's genes...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's true, Captain, this<br>
    technology requires another<br>
    positronic brain that's fully<br>
    programmed...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And Data's the only person around<br>
    who has one. That does kind of<br>
    makes him Lal's dad.</p>
  <p> Picard looks around... this is obviously a popular<br>
    decision. But not with him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course, it is not complete.<br>
    We have only made two transfers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why didn't you give it a more<br>
    human look, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I decided to allow Lal to choose<br>
    its own appearance and sex.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 1/2/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges, but has had enough...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, at your convenience,<br>
    I'd like to talk to you in my<br>
    Ready Room. Counselor...<br>
    (please join me)</p>
  <p> Troi and Picard start to leave...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain... Have a cigar.</p>
  <p> He picks up a box of cigars and holds it out... Picard<br>
    reacts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it is customary.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a cigar, EXITS, so does Troi as she<br>
    follows Picard, the others follow suit...</p>
  <p>4A OMITTED</p>
  <p>4B INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi as they leave the lab. Picard is<br>
    obviously disturbed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would suggest we do whatever<br>
    we can to discourage this<br>
    perception of the new android as<br>
    a &quot;child&quot;...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 1/2/90 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>4B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Waits for Troi's concurrence which doesn't come. Looks<br>
    at her --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, it is not a child.<br>
    It is an invention, albeit an<br>
    extraordinary one.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why should biology or technology<br>
    determine whether it is a child?<br>
    I see a man who has created an<br>
    offspring... a new life out of<br>
    his own being. That suggests a<br>
    child to me. If Data wishes to<br>
    call Lal his child, who are we to<br>
    argue?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    If he must, fine. But I don't<br>
    understand how he can call a five<br>
    foot android, with heuristic<br>
    learning systems and the strength<br>
    of a ten men a &quot;child&quot;.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've never been a parent.</p>
  <p> Picard does a take as they turn a corner.</p>
  <p>5 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Data sits on the sofa... pull back to reveal Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, what you have done has very<br>
    serious ramifications and I am<br>
    dismayed that you did not inform<br>
    anyone of what you were doing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/22/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry I did not anticipate<br>
    your objections, Captain. Do you<br>
    wish me to deactivate Lal?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is a life, Data. It cannot<br>
    be activated or de-activated<br>
    simply. It is a stupendous<br>
    undertaking. Have you any idea<br>
    what will happen when Starfleet<br>
    learns of this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have followed all Starfleet<br>
    regulations to the best of my<br>
    ability, Captain... I expected<br>
    they would be pleased...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll see.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My foremost concern is for the<br>
    safety of this ship and crew.<br>
    You are faster, stronger, and far<br>
    more knowledgeable than any<br>
    human...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can assure you Lal's programming<br>
    includes psychological inhibitor<br>
    safeguards to prevent any threat<br>
    to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/22/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And in the event of a malfunction?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A malfunction is of course a<br>
    possibility, Captain. But Lal's<br>
    program is equipped like mine --<br>
    it will shut down before<br>
    deleterious behavior can begin.</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head, still fuming...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've taken on quite a<br>
    responsibility, Mister Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    To prepare, I have scanned all<br>
    the available literature on<br>
    parenting. There seems to be much<br>
    confusion on the issue. One<br>
    traditional doctrine insists<br>
    &quot;spare the rod and spoil the<br>
    child&quot;, suggesting a punitive<br>
    approach... another more liberal<br>
    attitude would allow a child<br>
    enormous freedom...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (trying to interrupt)<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And what the Klingons do to their<br>
    children...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    I'm not talking about parenting.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm talking about the<br>
    extraordinary consequences of<br>
    creating new life.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Does that not describe becoming<br>
    a parent, sir?</p>
  <p> Not wanting to get into this --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/28/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are seeking to achieve what<br>
    no one, other than your own<br>
    creator, has been able to achieve<br>
    -- to make another sentient,<br>
    functional android. To make<br>
    another Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is why I must attempt this,<br>
    Captain. I have observed that<br>
    in most species, there is a primal<br>
    instinct to perpetuate themselves.<br>
    And while I have not been<br>
    programmed with instinctive<br>
    behavior patterns, I do understand<br>
    that I have been, until now, the<br>
    last of my kind. If I were damaged<br>
    or destroyed, I would be lost<br>
    forever. But if I am successful<br>
    with the creation of Lal, my<br>
    continuance is assured. I believe<br>
    I understand the consequences. And<br>
    I am prepared to accept the<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> On Picard's reaction...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>

    sexuality, level two. That will<br>
    define the parameters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Whatever you choose will be yours<br>
    for your lifetime, Lal... It is<br>
    a decision that will affect how<br>
    people interrelate with you.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    (turning to Troi)<br>
    I choose... your sex... and<br>
    appearance.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts.</p>

  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, Lal... that would be<br>
    confusing. We are taking you to<br>

    programmed. You may choose from<br>

    you'll see it is imperative to<br>

    blame of the M-5 catastrophe can<br>
    be laid entirely on the fact that<br>
    Doctor Daystrom was working in<br>

  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    This is your idea of appropriate<br>
    guidance...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is an opportunity for her to<br>
    observe human behavior and more<br>
    importantly to interact with her<br>
    crewmates.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    She's capable of running over<br>
    sixty trillion calculations per<br>
    second and you have her working as<br>
    a cocktail waitress.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, she is working under the<br>
    strict guidance of a woman in<br>
    whom I have absolute trust.<br>
    Ten-Forward is the center of the<br>
    ship's social activity. Everyone<br>
    on board comes here...</p>

  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    I'm not convinced the sort of<br>
    behavior she observes here will<br>
    be a positive influence.</p>
  <p> GUINAN (O.S.)<br>
    My customers usually behave<br>
    themselves... if not, they're<br>
    asked to leave. There's something<br>
    to learn from that as well,<br>
    wouldn't you say?</p>

  <p> to reveal Guinan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Haftel, Guinan. She runs<br>
    Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p> He nods to her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is Lal doing, Guinan?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    She spills a few drinks like the<br>
    rest of us. But she's learning<br>
    a lot.</p>
  <p> Some raucous laughter from a table that Lal is<br>
    serving...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I'm sorry, this is just<br>
    outrageous.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Come now, Admiral, I'm sure you've<br>
    been in a few bars in your day...</p>
  <p> The admiral looks cooly to Picard...</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    I want the android out of here...<br>
    have her report to me immediately<br>
    for an interview.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - 12/19/89 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>44B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data acknowledges, crosses the room to Lal as Haftel<br>
    EXITS... Picard gives Guinan a look... she shrugs, what<br>
    can you do... he finally shakes his head and EXITS.</p>

  <p>45A INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Lal and Haftel. Haftel deceptively cordial.<br>
    He smiles warmly to Lal. Lal is uncomfortable... this<br>
    is rather like being called to the principal's office.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Well, I've been looking forward<br>
    to meeting you, Lal.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    You're very important to us at<br>
    Starfleet Research. We've got<br>
    quite a facility at Galor Four.<br>
    I'd like to show it to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Admiral is in fact suggesting<br>
    you be moved to Galor Four, Lal.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Have I done something wrong?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Not at all. But it is important<br>
    to broaden your experiences. And<br>
    there's just so much you can learn<br>
    aboard a starship, wouldn't you<br>
    agree?</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Yes, I'd agree.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Thus, the natural conclusion would<br>
    be when I have learned all there<br>
    is to learn aboard the starship,<br>
    I would relocate to Galor Four.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/20/89 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    I don't agree. That is not the<br>
    natural conclusion here.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    I believe it is.</p>
  <p> Turning to Picard as though she were not in the room.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    You see, she resists alternative<br>
    suggestions to her own father's<br>
    wishes. That's not a good sign.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Excuse me, sir, I do not know my<br>
    father's wishes.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    He did not &quot;warn&quot; you about this<br>
    conversation?</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Warn me? No, Admiral. He told me<br>
    to answer your questions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The admiral is concerned that you<br>
    need more guidance than your<br>
    father can provide here on the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Do not misunderstand. I have<br>
    great respect for your... father.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    You do not speak with respect.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I find her very adversarial.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/28/89 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>45A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    I am only stating a fact, Admiral.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Apparently, your father has not<br>
    taught you about selective<br>
    judgment in verbalizing your<br>
    thoughts. This is a skill we can<br>
    help you develop.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    My father is already helping me,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Yes, well, the question is whether<br>
    he's helping you enough.</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    Are you asking me, sir?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    No, I didn't mean...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why don't we, Admiral? In all<br>
    these discussions, we've never<br>
    once mentioned Lal's wishes.<br>
    She's a free, sentient being.<br>
    What are your wishes, Lal?</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    I wish to remain here, Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you. You're excused.</p>
  <p> The admiral glances sternly at Picard and then nods,<br>
    fine, the interview is over. Lal looks quite concerned<br>
    as she EXITS.</p>

  <p> Lal ENTERS. Her movements are subtly but noticeably a<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Hello, Lal. How are you?</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    An admiral from Starfleet has come<br>

    scared.</p>
  <p> A beat... as Troi reacts and stands... realizing --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You are scared, aren't you?</p>
  <p> And it takes Lal a beat to realize too... she exchanges<br>
    a look with Troi, stunned to realize --</p>
  <p> LAL<br>
    I... feel it. How is that<br>
    possible?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p>48C INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Data has joined Picard and Haftel.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Commander, you have Lal off to<br>
    a wonderful start in life. And<br>
    that's what being a parent is all<br>
    about. But I have decided I must<br>
    ask you to release her to me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I know why, sir?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    All the other arguments aside,<br>
    there is one that is irrefutable.<br>
    There are only two Soong-type<br>
    androids in existence. It is far<br>
    too dangerous to have the two of<br>
    you in one place. Especially on<br>
    a starship. One lucky shot by<br>
    some Romulan and we lose you both.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a fine argument, Admiral.<br>
    But it doesn't change my feeling<br>
    that the proper place for Lal to<br>
    develop is by Data's side.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    You're not a parent, Captain.<br>
    I am. I've learned, with<br>
    difficulty, that there's a time<br>
    when...<br>
    (including himself with<br>
    Data)<br>
    ... all parents have to let go of<br>
    our children... for their own<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Offspring&quot; - REV. 12/21/89 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>48C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not that time. The<br>
    umbilical cord is virtually uncut.<br>
    The child...<br>
    (and this is the first<br>
    time that Picard uses<br>
    the word &quot;child&quot;<br>
    comfortably, and he<br>
    realizes it).<br>
    ... the child depends on him.</p>
  <p> Haftel looks at Picard -- the decision has been made.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Mister Data, it would be much<br>
    better for Lal if she left knowing<br>
    you had voluntarily decided this<br>
    was the best course of action.</p>
  <p> He looks expectantly to Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Admiral, when I created Lal, it<br>
    was with the hope that someday<br>
    she would choose to enter the<br>
    Academy and become a member of<br>
    Starfleet. I wanted to give<br>
    something back in return for all<br>
    Starfleet has given me. I still<br>
    do. But Lal is my child. You<br>
    ask that I volunteer to give her<br>
    up. I cannot. That would<br>
    violate every lesson I have<br>
    learned about human parenting.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    As Captain Picard told me after<br>
    he first met her, I have taken<br>
    on &quot;quite a responsibility.&quot; I<br>
    have brought a new life into this<br>
    world. It is my duty, not<br>
    Starfleet's, to guide her through<br>
    these first difficult steps to<br>
    maturity, to support her as she<br>
    learns, to prepare her to be a<br>
    contributing member of society.<br>
    No one can relieve me of that<br>
    obligation. And I cannot ignore<br>
    it. I am her father.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Data with extraordinary respect.</p>

  <p>48C CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>

    aboard my ship.</p>
  <p> Data rises to comply.</p>

  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    (icy)<br>
    I beg... your pardon?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll take the matter to Starfleet<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    I am Starfleet, Captain... and<br>
    this is an order. Proceed,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hold your ground, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HAFTEL<br>
    Do you understand you're risking<br>
    your command and your career,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are times, sir, when men<br>
    of good conscience cannot blindly<br>
    follow orders. You acknowledge<br>
    they are sentient, but ignore<br>
    their personal liberty and<br>
    freedom. Order a man to turn his<br>
    child over to the state? Not<br>
    while I am his captain. If you<br>
    wish, the Enterprise is prepared<br>
    to accompany you to Starfleet<br>
    Command and then we'll see what...</p>

    It lasted barely a moment. She<br>
    experienced an extraordinary range<br>

  <p> Pulling back to see Data and Haftel are beginning to<br>
    examine her as Picard stands with Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    For no apparent reason she got<br>

    she didn't say another word, she<br>
    just started walking here... and<br>
    each step became more and more<br>
