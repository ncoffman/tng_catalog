  <p>3A EXT. BEACH - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Pounding waves. A full amber moon. A tropical breeze.</p>
  <p>3B A PAIR OF HANDS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> pick up two half coconuts with two straws in them. As<br>
    it moves... pull back to reveal GEORDI's the one<br>
    holding them and he's sitting on a blanket on the sand<br>
    with a very attractive young woman (CHRISTY) ... a<br>
    decided tension in the air.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Another Coco-no-no?</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    No thanks, I think I've had enough<br>
    already.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, me too.</p>
  <p> And he has these two coconuts in his hand... looks<br>
    around with what to do with them. Finally, just sort<br>
    of drops them off to the side. He snaps his finger<br>
    and a GYPSY VIOLIN PLAYER MATERIALIZES beside them...<br>
    startling Christy. Geordi desperately wants to find<br>
    the courage to make his move. The gypsy begins to play<br>
    romantic music. Finally, awkwardly, attempting to be<br>
    casual, he moves closer to her... raises...</p>
  <p>4 HIS ARM</p>
  <p> toward her shoulder... he hasn't touched her yet...</p>
  <p>5 GEORDI</p>
  <p> has the stiff smile of someone who wants to look<br>
    comfortable but isn't. Slowly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/1/89 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>6 HIS HAND</p>
  <p> comes to rest on her shoulder... and now's the<br>
    moment... and the instant he touches her...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (tense)<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    I'm sorry. I think I better go<br>
    back now.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're chilly... ? I can turn down<br>
    the breeze...</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    No, it's been a lovely program,<br>
    and you're a terrific guy...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (knows what's coming)<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    I just don't feel that way about<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> The gypsy violinist plays his soul out... irritatingly<br>
    loud.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Knock it off.</p>
  <p> The music continues.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Do you require full termination<br>
    of the Holodeck program or just<br>
    the audio portion?</p>
  <p> On Geordi's frustrated sigh...</p>
  <p>8 INT. TEN-FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WESLEY and DATA standing at the window looking out the<br>
    windows at a field of immense flotsam and jetsam moving<br>
    by, the remains of a planet destroyed in a battle long<br>
    ago...</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This was the final battle, wasn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - 8/31/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Neither side intended Orelious<br>
    Nine to be the decisive conflict.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not much of it left, is there...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The destruction is remarkable<br>
    considering the primitive weapons<br>
    of the period.</p>
  <p> In the background, Geordi ENTERS looking forlorn, sits<br>
    at the bar... GUINAN moves to him... Wesley reacts.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Uh oh...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I beg your pardon, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    &quot;Uh oh&quot;... it's an expression,<br>
    Data. It just means, you know,<br>
    uh oh, something's wrong...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is something wrong?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Commander La Forge had a big date<br>
    with Christy tonight. He's been<br>
    working on the perfect program<br>
    for days. Looks like it ended<br>
    kinda early.</p>

    Uh oh.</p>

  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, WORF are already at their stations as<br>
    Data ENTERS. Riker fills them in...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're picking up a signal,<br>
    coordinates two-one-one mark<br>
    six-one.</p>
  <p> Data sits in his position, immediately engages his<br>
    computer. The sound of the signal is on the main<br>
    speaker... it is a series of rapid &quot;blips&quot; of sound.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reacting to the signal)<br>
    It is an ancient interplanetary<br>
    code.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Survivors on Orelious Nine after<br>
    all this time... not possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all possible. Lay in a<br>
    course to the source of the<br>
    signal.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (enthusiastic)<br>
    And with its Lang Cycle fusion<br>
    engines intact.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scanners indicate no life signs<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I should hope not. That ship<br>
    belongs in a museum.<br>
    (moving closer)<br>
    Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're a<br>
    little late. This call for help<br>
    was very likely initiated over<br>
    a thousand years ago.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ANCIENT WARSHIP<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43799.1.<br>
    We have arrived at Orelious Nine,<br>
    to chart the battle in which the<br>
    Menthars and Promellians fought<br>
    to their mutual extinction. Among<br>
    the ruins we have found a relic:<br>
    a Promellian battle cruiser that<br>
    has withstood the centuries.</p>
  <p>15 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker walking toward the Transporter Room;<br>
    Picard enthused with a spring in his step, Riker<br>
    concerned...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indulge me, Number One...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd prefer Lieutenant Worf and<br>
    I did a security sweep of the<br>
    vessel first...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    No. Captain's prerogative, here.<br>
    This one's mine. We've examined<br>
    every conceivable risk...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The risks aboard a vessel this<br>
    old and fragile are inconceivable,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ghosts, perhaps?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Haven't you ever dreamed of<br>
    climbing inside the bottle... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ship in the bottle, Number<br>
    One. Model air ships... I used<br>
    to build them as a child. By God,<br>
    I'll bet I even had a Promellian<br>
    battle cruiser too.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As they arrive... Worf is already waiting along with<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready to beam the away team to<br>
    the vessel...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Locked on to the Main Bridge,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're certain about the<br>
    atmospheric conditions, Data... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is adequate oxygen for life<br>
    support, Commander...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is exactly as they left it,<br>
    Number One. In the bottle.<br>
    (off their looks)<br>
    Good Lord, didn't anyone else here<br>
    build ships in bottles when they<br>
    were boys?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I did not play with toys.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was never a boy.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (speaking up, filling<br>
    the breach)<br>
    I did, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to a compatriot)<br>
    Thank you, Mister O'Brien.<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> And the child in the man has taken over his face as<br>
    his eyes shine with anticipation. The away team<br>
    DEMATERIALIZES. Riker looks at O'Brien with a cocked<br>
    eyebrow, suggesting he was stroking the captain for<br>
    points.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I did. I really did. Ships in<br>
    bottles. Great fun.</p>
  <p> Riker gives him a little smirk and as he starts to<br>
    exit, there is a notable, brief dip in the power of the<br>
    components -- a brown out. Neither Riker or O'Brien are<br>
    overly alarmed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Not sure. The secondary power<br>
    bus may need adjusting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me know.</p>
  <p> Riker leaves the Transporter Room. O'Brien adjusts<br>
    some switches on the console.</p>
  <p>17 INT. DARKENED ANCIENT WARSHIP BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf and Data move around a corner. It is<br>
    eerily still and dark... Worf lights a powerful<br>
    flashlamp.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Extraordinary. You would expect<br>
    the layout of a bridge from this<br>
    era to be clumsy, awkward... but<br>
    see this -- it is a model of<br>
    simplicity. They built the same<br>
    craft for generations. And it<br>
    worked.</p>
  <p> Picard wants to see everything, looks around like a kid<br>
    in a candy store. Something catches Worf's attention,<br>
    he turns...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/13/89 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Admirable. They died at their<br>
    posts.</p>
  <p> And Picard and Data look at Worf's discovery -- the<br>
    skeletal remains of an ancient crewman still in his<br>
    chair, head cocked to the side in the final throes of<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - 8/31/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>18 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> His head cocked to the side, rather like the skeleton,<br>
    Geordi downs another glass of synthehol. And he can't<br>
    quite get drunk, no matter how hard he tries...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't you have anything stronger<br>
    than this, Guinan?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Would it help?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Can you tell me something, Guinan?<br>
    You're a woman, right?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes, I can tell you that.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it that... you want in<br>
    a man?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Me personally?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    As a woman. What's the first<br>
    thing you look at?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    His head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh huh... his mind, of course.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, his head. I'm attracted to<br>
    bald men.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Seriously?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Seriously.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/8/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Maybe because a bald man was very<br>
    kind to me once... when I was<br>
    hurting. Took care of me.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd like to do that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (not serious)<br>
    I'm taking care of myself these<br>
    days.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I mean take care of somebody.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Guinan, I just don't get it...<br>
    I can field strip a fusion<br>
    reactor... I can realign a power<br>
    transfer tunnel... why can't I<br>
    make anything work with a woman<br>
    like Christy? I don't know what<br>
    to do, what to say...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I never noticed... as a woman.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're different.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, you're different.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But I'm not trying now.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> Another customer signals Guinan and she moves away. A<br>
    beat. He shakes his head sadly. He takes another<br>
    drink.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>19 INT. ANCIENT WARSHIP</p>
  <p> Data is patching in a small power pack... takes a few<br>
    calculations, then turns it on... dim emergency<br>
    lighting comes on. They continue their exploration...<br>
    the sound of the electronic distress signal is coming<br>
    closer as they work their way down a corridor... Worf<br>
    is recording images with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The source of the distress signal<br>
    is twenty meters ahead...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, be sure we get<br>
    tricorder images of their tactical<br>
    display...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Look here, Worf... how well laid<br>
    out it is. We went through how<br>
    many different designs before<br>
    we reached this kind of<br>
    sophistication... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe it was four, sir. We<br>
    did not have a fully integrated<br>
    tactical command until the<br>
    twenty-third century. In fact,<br>
    several of the Promellian<br>
    innovations served as inspiration<br>
    for early Federation starship<br>
    design...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As well they should have.</p>
  <p> Moving along, observing the large ducts...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Positron ducts. These channeled<br>
    power from one end of the ship<br>
    to the other.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p>20 INT. ANCIENT WARSHIP COMMUNICATIONS ROOM</p>
  <p> They ENTER. It is a room with several visual monitors<br>
    as well as radio and electronic equipment. The signal<br>
    beeps from a console where another skeleton has died...<br>
    Worf scans the room...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is safe to enter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's put an end to their last<br>
    cry for help.</p>
  <p> Worf moves to a switch on the console where a light<br>
    blinks and turns it off.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Data has found a device that may vaguely suggest a<br>
    playback apparatus... he examines a round wire coil<br>
    that is in playback position...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe this is an information<br>
    storage device... a crude analogue<br>
    of our own iso-linear optical<br>
    chip.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Crude by our standards today,<br>
    Data. When this ship was built,<br>
    humans on Earth had just perfected<br>
    the mechanical clock... and were<br>
    using steel crossbows in battle.<br>
    (examining it)<br>
    Is there any way to see what's<br>

  <p> A recreation of drafting room five. Banks of computers<br>
    working, propulsion equipment in various modes of<br>
    completion. (Through a window can be seen other forms<br>
    of starship equipment). In the center of the room is<br>
    the schematic display of the engines. Geordi moves<br>
    to the display, circles it, greatly impressed by the<br>
    room, its contents and purposes. To him, it's<br>
    beautiful.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Damn. Right back where it all<br>
    started. This is incredible...</p>
  <p> He moves to the cross section of the engine.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Leah, did you design this?</p>
  <p> LEAH'S VOICE<br>

    Could we alter the matter/anti-matter<br>

  <p> Close -- he studies a maze of systems...</p>
  <p> LEAH'S VOICE<br>
    Theoretically, yes. The system<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, this is your baby, show me<br>

  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Affirmative. You asked Doctor<br>
    Brahms to show you which system<br>

    imagery, an adequate facsimile<br>
    was possible.</p>

  <p> He shakes his head, smiles at himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    For what purpose?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've gone back to the beginning...<br>

    Okay, we know for every movement<br>

    There's a chance we could manuever<br>

    We're out. We beat it.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, the crew looks at him with awe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Crusher, the conn is yours.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (with great respect)<br>
    Yes, sir!</p>
  <p> Wesley takes his station. Picard returns to the<br>
    command chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Initiate full restart. Bring all<br>
    systems back on-line.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    With pleasure, sir.</p>
  <p> And with a victorious jab, Geordi turns his Engineering<br>
    Station back on, starts to work.</p>
  <p> BRIDGE LIGHTS come back on full.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... make sure the booby<br>
    trap won't bother anyone again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/13/89 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>85 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, ready photon<br>
    torpedoes, all bays... set to<br>
    detonate upon impact with the<br>
    Promellian vessel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>86 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> FIRING a spread of torpedoes that explodes at the<br>
    ancient vessel... and the entire area goes white with<br>
    the explosive force obliterating the entire asteroid<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> TIME CUT:</p>
  <p>87 INT. HOLODECK/DRAFTING ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi with Leah. A quiet moment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've always thought that<br>
    technology could solve any<br>
    problem. It enhances our quality<br>
    of life... It lets us travel<br>
    across the galaxy... It even gave<br>
    me my vision.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But sometimes you just need to<br>
    trust yourself and turn it all<br>
    off. Even the gypsy violins.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Violins?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Different program. Sorry.</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a beat.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    We made a good team.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe we could do it again some<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT FIVE 58A.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I'm with you every day, Geordi.<br>
    Every time you look at this<br>
    engine, you're looking at me.<br>
    Every time you touch it, it's me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Booby Trap&quot; - REV. 9/5/89 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He acknowledges. They smile at each other. He moves<br>
    to her and kisses her on the lips... a soft gentle,<br>
    goodbye kiss. A last look and...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer, exit Holodeck. Save<br>
    program.</p>
  <p> The door opens. The program ends. He leaves.</p>
  <p>88 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As it moves off to explore other worlds...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
