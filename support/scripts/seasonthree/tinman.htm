    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43779.3.<br>
    The Enterprise is preparing<br>
    detailed atmospheric charts of the<br>
    Hayashi system. Although tedious,<br>
    this endeavor is the first step<br>
    toward planet colonization.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER at Command. WORF and TROI are at<br>
    their stations. DATA and WESLEY are at Ops and Conn.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to something on the Ops panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors report the USS Hood<br>
    closing on an intercept course<br>
    at high warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's odd... I wasn't notified<br>
    of a rendezvous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They seem to be in an awful hurry.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, we are being hailed on a<br>
    secured channel by Captain DeSoto.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>

  <p>3<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    5</p>
  <p>6 WIDE ANGLE FAVORING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TIGHT ANGLE ON DESOTO in the Hood's Ready Room.</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    Sorry to sneak up on you like<br>
    that, Jean-Luc --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Robert, why didn't you inform<br>
    us --</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    -- Out here, you never know<br>
    who's listening. Keeps you on<br>
    your toes, anyway. Hey, Will,<br>
    you getting soft on that luxury<br>
    liner?</p>
  <p> Riker grins. Picard is still puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So, old friend. How are you?</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    Ah, you know, they send you<br>
    Galaxy-Class boys out here to the<br>
    far reaches. Me, I'm hauling my<br>
    butt back and forth between<br>
    starbases --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Smiling to Riker and Troi; DeSoto's put-on griping is<br>
    an old song going back to when he and Picard served<br>
    together as lieutenants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But not today.</p>
  <p>8 CROSSCUTTING FROM BRIDGE TO MAIN VIEWER AS NECESSARYY<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    Nope. Starfleet's got new orders<br>
    for you. This is top priority.<br>
    They need the fastest ship in<br>
    the fleet -- and the best people.<br>
    That's you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If time is so important, why<br>
    didn't they transmit the orders<br>
    by subspace?</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    They're worried about Romulan<br>
    eavesdropping on this one. And<br>
    we've got a passenger for you.<br>
    Hard to send by subspace.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What sort of passenger?</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    Mission specialist. He'll bring<br>
    your orders aboard with him.<br>
    Name's Tam Elbrun.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (startled)<br>
    Elbrun? You mean Tam Elbrun as<br>
    in the Ghorusda disaster?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/7/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    The same.<br>
    (sighing)<br>
    What can I say? Your orders are<br>
    to cooperate fully with him.</p>
  <p>9 REACTION SHOT OF TROI</p>
  <p> clearly distressed at the discussion of Elbrun.</p>
  <p> DESOTO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Best of luck, folks. Hood out.</p>
  <p>10 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> A view of space replaces DeSoto's image.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the Hood is slowing to<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p> Picard rises, looks dubiously at the others. Most of<br>
    whom clearly know the name Elbrun.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, come with me --</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> who steps anxiously toward Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, let me come with you to<br>
    greet Tam --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know him?</p>
  <p>12 CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I do... He was at the university<br>
    on Betazed when I studied<br>
    psychology there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, I see. He was a colleague,<br>
    then.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, sir. He was a patient...</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND U.S.S. HOOD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> running at impulse speed.</p>
  <p>14 INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT - PICARD, TROI AND DATA</p>
  <p> ENTERING the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Tam is a telepath of extraordinary<br>
    talent, even for a Betazoid. He's<br>
    a specialist in first contact with<br>
    new life-forms, and... a rather<br>
    unique person.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    He's not what you might expect,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Troi and Picard EXIT into Transporter Room. Off Data's<br>
    puzzled expression as he follows them.</p>
  <p>15 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien behind console, as Tam Elbrun MATERIALIZES on<br>
    the transporter. He's a mid-thirties Betazoid, with<br>
    wide, dark eyes. He appears nervous. Informally<br>
    dressed, not at all officious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/7/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    I'm --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Captain Picard. Here --</p>
  <p> Tam reaches into his pocket and produces a data<br>
    cassette. He flips it casually to Picard as he steps<br>
    down. Picard catches it, annoyed. Tam's attitude is<br>
    abrupt and rude.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You want to know all about your<br>
    mission. Everything's on there.<br>
    Orders and briefings. Destination<br>
    and heading, all that.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE ON PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> standing by transporter console. Picard is visibly<br>
    annoyed. He hands the cassette to Data, who accepts it<br>
    and steps toward Tam as if to ask a question.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    I sensed you were out here.<br>
    How've you been?</p>
  <p>17 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (embarrassed by Tam's<br>
    tactlessness, she still<br>
    can't help smiling)<br>
    Fine, but Tam, I...</p>
  <p> TAM TROI<br>
    Thought you were on ... thought you were on<br>
    Chandra Five. Chandra Five.</p>
  <p> They laugh -- this is a familiar routine to them both.<br>
    Data now has come to stand behind Tam, unnoticed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir --</p>
  <p> Tam whirls on Data as if a rocket just went off behind<br>
    him. NO ONE has EVER approached Tam Elbrun without his<br>
    awareness. Until now.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Who -- what are you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    My name is Data.</p>
  <p> Tam locks gazes with Troi, READING the answers he wants<br>
    from HER MIND. Then he looks back at Data, fascinated<br>
    as a child with a new toy.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Incredible, an android. I can't<br>
    read you at all. It's like you're<br>
    not there.</p>
  <p> Data frowns, puzzled. Tam notices the cassette in the<br>
    android's hand.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Oh. You better hurry up to the<br>
    bridge with that. Captain wants<br>
    you to run the orders, scan the<br>
    technical schematics, and be ready<br>
    to brief him in ten minutes.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Right?</p>
  <p> Picard activates his communicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meet Mister Data on the bridge.<br>
    He has our orders and new heading.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to Data. Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And assemble the bridge staff for<br>
    a mission briefing in -- fifteen<br>
    minutes. Picard out.<br>
    (to Tam)<br>
    Mister Elbrun. Would you --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (flatly)<br>
    Like to see my quarters. No.<br>
    I'd rather get this briefing over<br>
    with. Then be left alone until<br>
    I'm needed.</p>
  <p> Tam EXITS. Troi looks apologetically at Picard, who is<br>
    severe. They exit together after Tam.</p>
  <p>18 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND U.S.S HOOD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Hood veers away to starboard, leaving the<br>
    Enterprise. The Enterprise turns.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT - RIKER AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> are walking to turbolift.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've heard something about<br>
    Ghorusda. Weren't about forty<br>
    people killed --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Forty-seven, including the captain<br>
    of the Adelphi -- and two friends<br>
    from my class at the Academy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sorry. What happened?</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi step into turbolift. The doors close.</p>
  <p>20 INT. TURBOLIFT - RIKER AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It was a first contact situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Ghorusdans values are so<br>
    complex, and so different, that<br>
    the Federation sent along a<br>
    specialist. To prevent<br>
    misunderstanding.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That was Tam Elbrun? And what<br>
    happened was his fault?</p>
  <p> Riker considers a moment, before answering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not directly. Board of inquiry<br>
    blamed Captain Darson's<br>
    carelessness about Ghorusdan<br>
    cultural taboos.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    But if Elbrun's so good, why<br>
    didn't he warn Darson? What was<br>
    he there for, if he couldn't sense<br>
    that much hostility?</p>
  <p>21 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is at Science One. Worf at Tactical.<br>
    Supernumeraries at all other stations. Data is loading<br>
    the data chip. Geordi and Riker stand at Data's<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, Geordi... do you ever<br>
    feel as if I am not &quot;there?&quot; That<br>
    is to say... not &quot;here.&quot;</p>
  <p> Reactions from others. Geordi clasps Data's shoulders<br>
    as if testing his solidness.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You seem to be all here.</p>
  <p> Data considers this, then turns his attention to the<br>
    screen where the information is appearing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our destination is the Beta<br>
    Stromgren system, following the<br>
    path of the Vega Nine probe.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's twenty-three parsecs beyond<br>
    our furthest manned explorations.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct, Commander.<br>
    Apparently the probe has<br>
    discovered...<br>
    (a beat, reacting to<br>
    something he sees on<br>
    the screen)<br>
    ...Astonishing.</p>
  <p>22 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Riker, Geordi, Troi, Data, Worf<br>
    and Tam Elbrun. Tam is seated next to Data. NOTE:<br>
    throughout this scene Tam should appear distracted by<br>
    pain, as from a bad headache.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>23 CLOSE ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> of a RED SUPERGIANT STAR. Flashing around it in close<br>
    orbit is a TINY, BRILLIANT WHITE light.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is the star Beta Stromgren...</p>
  <p>24 PULL BACK TO SHOW OUR PEOPLE AND TAM SEATED AROUND<br>
    TABLE</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Scientists have discovered that<br>
    it is in the final stages of an<br>
    alternating cycle of expansion<br>
    and collapse, which will soon<br>
    result in a supernova.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However, the long-range unmanned<br>
    probe which Starfleet sent to<br>
    observe the process has discovered<br>
    something much more --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Oh, Data -- don't waste time.</p>
  <p> Tam reaches past a startled Data and PUNCHES the<br>
    projector CONTROLS. The screen FREEZES its motion.<br>
    A FRAME APPEARS around the star's tiny companion, and<br>
    the framed area is MAGNIFIED to REPLACE the star image.</p>
  <p>25 CLOSE ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The new image is a SLENDER OBJECT which PULSES WITH<br>
    LIGHT, of organic appearance. At the aft end of the<br>
    object are two GLOWING ORANGE GRIDS -- clearly ENGINES.<br>
    The whole surface of the thing is NETWORKED by faintly<br>
    pulsing pale white ENERGY PATHS, suggesting something<br>
    between lightning charges and a human circulatory<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    They call it &quot;Tin Man&quot;. The Vega<br>
    Probe found it orbiting Stromgren.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>26 BACK TO SHOT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Looks like a ship of some kind.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Its energy source is unknown.<br>
    The people who've studied the<br>
    transmissions think it's a<br>
    starship. And they're sure it's<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (immediately fascinated)<br>
    Alive? How so?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A cybernetic organism -- like the<br>
    Borg?</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    No, no, NO! Here --</p>
  <p> Tam manipulates the projector controls again. Data<br>
    looks on, bemused, as the image on the screen is<br>
    replaced by rotating multi-plane artwork representing<br>
    interior diagrams and schematics of Tin Man.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Starfleet believes it's an<br>
    organic creature, born in space,<br>
    living its life in the wastes<br>
    between stars.</p>
  <p> Tam RISES, WINCING slightly, and PACES the room,<br>
    growing more excited as he speaks. Troi notices his<br>
    discomfort.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No one knows where it came from,<br>
    or why it's here now. And we're<br>
    going to meet it. We're going<br>
    to talk to it.<br>
    (softly, as if to<br>
    himself)<br>
    I'm going to talk to it.</p>
  <p> Riker regards Tam dubiously.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have attempts been made --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    To communicate with it by<br>
    subspace. Of course --<br>
    linguacode, universal translation,<br>
    all that. It won't work. Tin Man<br>
    is too different. Direct<br>
    mind-to-mind contact is our only<br>
    hope.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The opportunity for discovery is<br>
    extraordinary -- but I don't yet<br>
    understand Starfleet's urgency<br>
    --</p>
  <p> Tam turns to Troi, a little blankly -- the telepath<br>
    is lost in imagination.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Romulans --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Hell, I forgot -- the Romulans...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They claim the sector of space<br>
    in which Beta Stromgren is<br>
    located.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Romulans claim all that is<br>
    within their field of vision.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And they routinely monitor the<br>
    telemetry of our deep-space<br>
    probes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So it's quite certain they'll<br>
    be sending a ship of their own<br>
    to investigate this Tin Man.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    No... Actually, they're sending<br>
    two. Uh, Data --</p>
  <p> Riker reacts -- concerned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. Starbase one<br>
    twenty-three detected two<br>
    D'daridex class cruisers on an<br>
    intercept course.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The top speed of this class vessel<br>
    is known to be less than our own,<br>
    sir. We therefore have some<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So, it's a race?<br>
    (thoughtfully)<br>
    An alien intelligence -- a new<br>
    life-form -- representing a<br>
    technology far beyond that of<br>
    either the Romulans or ourselves.<br>
    The Romulans will take whatever<br>
    measures -- military or otherwise<br>
    -- are required to secure the<br>
    creature for study.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Study as in dissect, I'd bet.</p>

  <p>27 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, you're our resident honor<br>
    student in exobiology. I'm<br>
    assigning you to head up life<br>
    sciences on this mission.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Meeting adjourned, then.</p>
  <p> Everyone but Picard, Tam, Data and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    So, Data -- I guess you're the<br>
    brains of this outfit, huh?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Elbrun -- one reason I want<br>
    you to work closely with a member<br>
    of my staff is to avoid any<br>
    further... omissions. The<br>
    possibility of an encounter with<br>
    Romulans on this mission is hardly<br>
    trivial. Yet you --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    All right, all right... I should<br>
    have brought up the Romulans<br>
    earlier, but I was distracted.</p>
  <p> Riker looks annoyed. Tam reads his thoughts, and turns<br>
    to glare at him.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>

    And no, Billy boy, I wasn't<br>
    &quot;distracted&quot; on Ghorusda.<br>

  <p> Traveling at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43782.6.<br>
    Travelling at top warp, we are<br>
    still several days from rendezvous<br>
    with the mysterious entity which<br>
    Starfleet has christened Tin Man.</p>
  <p>30 INT. SICKBAY - BEVERLY'S OFFICE - WIDE SHOT</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi are present. BEVERLY is at her desk,<br>
    consulting the computer terminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My immediate concern is with Tam<br>
    Elbrun. Starfleet considers his<br>
    unique abilities crucial to our<br>
    mission. Yet he seems to me...<br>
    unstable.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, according to his medical<br>
    records and psych profile, he's<br>
    very high on the ESP scale. A<br>
    sort of prodigy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A prodigy? In what sense?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In most Betazoids their telepathic<br>
    gifts develop at adolescence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're not born reading minds?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. Except... for some reason<br>
    that no one understands,<br>
    occasionally a Betazoid child is<br>
    born different.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How &quot;different?&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Born with their telepathic<br>
    abilities &quot;switched on.&quot;<br>
    Most Betazoids born like that<br>
    never lead a normal life.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (understanding now)<br>
    The noise of other people's<br>
    thoughts and feelings must be...<br>
    overwhelming. Incomprehensible...<br>
    especially for a child.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And painful. Early diagnosis and<br>
    special training helped Tam adjust<br>
    -- but he has some problems.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    You mentioned a hospitalization<br>

  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    For stress. Repeatedly,<br>
    throughout his life.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I always wonder... what holds one<br>
    person together through that kind<br>
    of struggle, while another goes<br>
    under?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, well, he's evidently done<br>
    more than &quot;hold together&quot;. He's<br>
    the indispensable man -- the<br>
    Federation's finest specialist<br>
    in communication with unknown<br>
    life-forms.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It looks like the more unusual a<br>
    life form is, the better he likes<br>
    it. His personnel file shows that<br>
    he's gravitated toward assignments<br>
    that isolate him from other<br>
    humanoids.</p>
  <p>31 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data at Command, Worf at Security, Wesley Crusher at Conn.<br>
    Geordi is monitoring the bridge Engineering Aft<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Commander Data, I'm picking up<br>
    an unusual echo from my<br>
    navigational sensors.</p>
  <p> Worf looks up from his security board.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is something there, sir,<br>
    tracking us -- matching our speed<br>
    and heading. Something which<br>
    doesn't fully register on our<br>
    instruments.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>32 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> as he consults the back-up Conn panel on his command<br>
    chair.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since there is no known natural<br>
    phenomenon capable of travel at<br>
    warp velocities, there are but<br>
    two possibilities: either it is<br>
    a sensor malfunction, or it is<br>
    another ship, following us<br>
    covertly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is not a sensor malfunction.</p>
  <p>33 BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p> as Data RISES and WALKS toward the MAIN VIEWER,<br>
    concerned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A Romulan ship? With their<br>
    cloaking device, we shouldn't pick<br>
    them up at all.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Unless they're pulling so much<br>
    power for something else that they<br>
    can't fully cloak.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Like what?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Ask the Romulans... if it is the<br>
    Romulans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant, continue monitoring<br>
    the precise position of the echo<br>
    -- at any sudden change in its<br>
    behavior, initiate Yellow Alert.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p>34 INT. TAM ELBRUN'S GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL) - TAM</p>
  <p> is STANDING by the long WINDOW, face half-away from<br>
    the camera, watching the STARS STREAK BY at warp.<br>
    Lights in his cabin are low; he is lost in the depths<br>
    until:</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> He says this a moment BEFORE the DOOR CHIME SOUNDS and<br>
    Deanna Troi ENTERS. Tam does NOT look to see who it<br>
    is.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    How're things in the land of the<br>
    living?</p>
  <p> Now he turns to look at her, smiling.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought you might be lonely.<br>
    No one sees you, except Data.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Lonely? I can hear everything<br>
    that everyone on this ship thinks.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    No one besides you seems to be<br>
    missing my charming --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (interrupting, annoyed)<br>
    You want them to dislike you.<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Tam TURNS away.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Because I'm not a nice guy?<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Okay -- because they scare me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/6/90 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>35 ANGLE ON TAM</p>
  <p> as he crosses and SLUMPS wearily into a chair.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Too many minds, Deanna. I can't<br>
    shut them out -- never could<br>
    learn. All their loves, their<br>
    hates, their fears, their...<br>
    needs. It's like a tide that<br>
    never ebbs.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I could drown.</p>
  <p> Troi walks to Tam and places a sympathetic hand on his<br>
    shoulder --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I remember.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (smiling in<br>
    remembrance.)<br>
    You understood -- at least a<br>
    little -- how I felt.<br>
    (indicates the ship)<br>
    I see you finally found a place<br>
    to fit... people to care about...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you're still looking.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    (he stands and begins<br>
    to pace)<br>
    Then there's Ghorusda. I've got<br>
    enough doubts about my...<br>
    reliability... without having to<br>
    listen to Riker's, and Picard's<br>
    --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened there?</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    I thought everyone knew --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No. What happened to you?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Tin Man&quot; - REV. 2/2/90 - ACT TWO 24A.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Maybe... I got too involved with<br>
    the Ghorusdans, with their point<br>
    of view. It happens to me. I<br>
    wanted everyone to get along.<br>
    I could have warned Darson more<br>
    forcefully.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So after that, you ran away? The<br>
    last I heard, you were the only<br>
    Federation delegate assigned to<br>
    Chandra Five.</p>

  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Beautiful creatures, the<br>
    Chandrans. Their minds are<br>
    glacial. They have a lovely<br>
    three-day ritual for saying<br>
    &quot;hello.&quot; Peaceful, untroubled<br>
    people...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Unlike humanoids?</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Well, except for your friend Data.<br>
    I like him. He's... restful.</p>
  <p> Troi tries vainly to suppress a smile.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I believe your impression of Data<br>
    is probably unique.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Yeah? Well, having to get to know<br>
    someone, just once, has its appeal.<br>
    I mean, talking to them, instead<br>
    of getting it all at once up here<br>
    --<br>
    (Tam taps his forehead)<br>
    -- whether I want it or not.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But you accepted this mission.<br>
    You could have stayed on Chandra<br>
    Five. You willingly came aboard<br>
    a ship of over a thousand people<br>
    --</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    How could I not? Think of it,<br>
    Dee. This intelligence that swims<br>
    naked through space like a fish<br>
    in the sea. Totally alien,<br>
    mysterious -- not like us at all.<br>
    Ancient. And alone.<br>
    (quietly, as if to<br>
    himself)<br>
    So lonely, for so long.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    How can you know that? Tam?</p>

  <p> Tam LOOKS AWAY toward the cabin WINDOWS, where the<br>
    stars stream by. Troi's eyes widen as she senses the<br>
    TRUTH, from his silence and his mind.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're in contact with it. With<br>
    Tin Man. Aren't you?</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    No -- well... yes. A little.<br>
    Not quite on a conscious level.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But we're still light-years away.<br>
    That must be impossible -- even<br>
    for you.</p>

    It is indeed laid out as a vessel,<br>

  <p> Tam LEANS across the work station, to regard Data<br>
    intently.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Why? Must living beings have a<br>

    I do not believe I am qualified<br>
    to express an opinion.</p>
  <p> TAM<br>
    Ah, Data -- you're uniquely<br>

    you've known him for years. How<br>
    far can he be trusted?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, the issue isn't one of<br>
    trust in Tam's intentions, but<br>
    in his judgment. I would trust<br>
    him to do what he believes is<br>
    right --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, of course. But his<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Afraid of what?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sense that the alien is somehow<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I agree that Tam's<br>

  <p> Tam moves down the room to the pulsing walls, and<br>
    softly strokes it. The pulsing forms respond by<br>
    straining toward him.</p>

    not respond. A small frown from Data. Obviously the<br>
    ship has no interest in him.</p>

  <p> Data standing by the windows gazing out at the stars.<br>
    His expression is thoughtful. Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have had no further encounter<br>
    with the Romulans. As for the<br>
    whereabouts of Tin Man, and Tam<br>
    Elbrun -- we can only speculate.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You sent for me?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (turning to face her)<br>
    Tam's final request was for me<br>
    to explain his decision to the<br>
    crew. But I believe his hope was<br>
    that you would understand.</p>
  <p> Troi nods. A beat.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    What did happen, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I witnessed something remarkable.<br>
    (considers a moment)<br>
    Individually they were both so...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wounded? Incomplete?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. But no longer. Through<br>
    their joining they have been<br>
    healed. Grief was transmuted to<br>
    joy. Loneliness to belonging.</p>
  <p> Troi is hearing an echo of something new in Data's<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data, you do understand...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Counselor, when Tin Man<br>
    returned me to the Enterprise I<br>
    realized that this was where I<br>
    belong.</p>
  <p> A long look. Troi steps to his side, and lightly lays<br>
    a hand on his shoulder. They gaze out at the passing<br>
    stars.</p>
