  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. THE ENGLISH CAMP AT AGINCOURT - NIGHT<br>
    (HOLODECK)</p>
  <p> Two soldiers: JOHN BATES and MICHAEL WILLIAMS..</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    Brother John Bates, is not that<br>
    the morning which breaks yonder?</p>
  <p> BATES<br>
    I think it be. But we have no<br>
    great cause to desire the approach<br>
    of the day.</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    Who goes there?</p>
  <p> King Henry ENTERS... his back to us... so we cannot<br>
    see who is playing him...</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    A friend.</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    Under what captain serve you?</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    I pray you, what thinks he of<br>
    our estate?</p>
  <p> Reveal DATA...</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    Even as men wrecked upon a sand,<br>
    that look to be washed off the<br>
    next tide.</p>
  <p> BATES<br>
    He hath not told his thought to<br>
    the king?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Defector&quot; - REV. 10/20/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    No, nor it is not meet he should.<br>
    For though I speak it to you, I<br>
    think the king is but a man, as<br>
    I am. The violet smells to him<br>
    as it doth to me, in his<br>
    nakedness he appears but a man.<br>
    Therefore, his fears, out of<br>
    doubt, be of the same relish as<br>
    ours are. Yet, no man should<br>
    possess him with any appearance<br>
    of fear, lest he, by showing it,<br>
    should dishearten his army.</p>
  <p>2 ANGLE PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> observing... delighted...</p>
  <p> BATES<br>
    He may show what outward courage<br>
    he will, but I believe, as cold<br>
    a night as 'tis, he could wish<br>
    himself in Thames up to the neck.</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    Methinks I could not die anywhere<br>
    so contented as in the king's<br>
    company, his cause being just and<br>
    his quarrel honorable.</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    That's more than we know.</p>
  <p> BATES<br>
    Aye, or more than we should seek<br>
    after. If his cause be wrong,<br>
    our obedience to the king wipes<br>
    the crime of it out of us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Defector&quot; - REV. 10/20/89 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WILLIAMS<br>
    But if the cause be not good, the<br>
    king himself hath a heavy<br>
    reckoning to make when all those<br>
    legs and arms and heads chopped<br>
    off in a battle shall join<br>
    together at the latter day and<br>
    cry all &quot;We died at such a place&quot;<br>
    -- some swearing, some crying for<br>
    a surgeon, some upon their wives<br>
    left poor behind them. I am<br>
    afeared there are few die well<br>
    that die in a battle.</p>
  <p> DATA (KING HENRY)<br>
    The king is not bound to answer<br>
    the particular endings of his<br>
    soldiers, the father of his son,<br>
    nor the master of his servant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Delightful... you're getting<br>
    better and better, Data...</p>
  <p> Stepping out of character...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> The characters freeze.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you, sir. I plan to study<br>
    the performances of Olivier,<br>
    Branagh, Shapiro, Kullnark...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    Data, you are here to learn about<br>
    the human condition... and there's<br>
    no better way than embracing<br>
    Shakespeare... but you must<br>
    discover it through your own<br>
    performance, not by imitating...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Defector&quot; - REV. 10/19/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sensors are picking up an<br>
    unidentified craft in the Neutral<br>
    Zone... It's heading toward<br>
    Federation space...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On our way... Picard out. We'll<br>
    get to the next act later, Data...<br>
    computer, end program.</p>
  <p> The other characters DISAPPEAR and shortly thereafter,<br>
    the set disappears, too... Data begins to take off his<br>
    costume.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is interesting that a king<br>
    could pass as a commoner, but why<br>
    should he wish to? If he is<br>
    the leader... should he not be<br>
    leading... ?</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE</p>
  <p> The door slides open and they EXIT...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But listen to what Shakespeare<br>
    is telling you about the man,<br>
    Data... a king who has a true<br>
    feeling for his soldiers must<br>
    share their fears on the day of<br>
    battle.</p>
  <p>3A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Walking... perhaps a passerby reacts to Data's<br>
    costume...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, will I be able to schedule<br>
    a performance for the crew in<br>
    the near future?</p>

  <p> RIKER at an aft station. WORF at tactical.<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES at Ops and Conn. Picard ENTERS the<br>
    bridge. Monitors at the stations show a SCHEMATIC<br>
    DISPLAY of the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Outpost Sierra Six confirms our<br>
    readings, sir. They identify it<br>
    as a Romulan scout ship... bearing<br>
    two-seven-zero mark one-four.</p>

  <p>5 CLOSER ON ONE MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As Picard, Riker and Data huddle over it... The<br>
    Enterprise is clearly labeled and shown as a steady<br>
    dot, and a flashing point of light in the Zone shows<br>
    the Romulan vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A scout ship? Curious. What<br>
    would bring a scout ship into the<br>
    Neutral Zone?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shall we transmit a warning to<br>
    withdraw, sir... ?</p>

  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - ROMULAN SHIPS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Romulan scout ship is overmatched... the warship is<br>
    relentless and it FIRES TORPEDOES at the smaller craft.<br>
    One of the torpedoes finds its mark.</p>

  <p> SETAL, a Romulan male of about fifty (human) years of<br>
    age is sitting at the controls of his small ship.<br>
    There is evident damage in his bridge.</p>
  <p> SETAL<br>
    Please, you must help me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are moving to intercept...<br>
    maintain your course and power...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a muffled EXPLOSION and Setal's ship is<br>
    rocked violently. The transmission is abruptly cut off<br>
    and replaced with the starfield. The damaged scout<br>
    ship is clearly visible.</p>

  <p> On the viewscreen, the Romulan warship sits facing the<br>

  <p> The figure of Setal MATERIALIZES on the platform. He<br>
    wears a Romulan uniform with no insignia. His neck<br>
    is injured, but he appears otherwise unhurt. Setal<br>
    looks about for a second.</p>
  <p> SETAL<br>

    Captain's log, Stardate 43462.5.<br>
    We have beamed aboard an apparent<br>
    Romulan defector. He claims to<br>
    be a low ranking logistics officer<br>
    with extraordinary information<br>
    about a new secret offensive.</p>
  <p>21 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A guard stands behind Setal as he tells his story to<br>
    Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Geordi. The Romulan is<br>
    nearing the end of his account. He speaks with great<br>
    fervency. A man demanding to be heard. Picard listens<br>
    with a decidedly even expression.</p>
  <p> SETAL<br>
    The humiliating defeat at the<br>
    Battle of Cheron has not been<br>
    forgotten. The new leaders have<br>
    vowed to discard the treaty and<br>
    claim the Neutral Zone. Nelvana<br>
    Three is only the first step.</p>

    I'm sure you're tired from your<br>
    ordeal... and could use some<br>
    medical attention. Mister Worf,<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The empire knows we'd never allow<br>
    them to maintain a base within<br>
    the Neutral Zone.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, it would not be an<br>
    atypical Romulan ploy. In their<br>
    long history of war, the Romulans<br>
    have rarely attacked first... they<br>
    prefer to test their enemy's<br>
    resolve.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And how many times in their<br>
    history has there been a Romulan<br>
    defector?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (beat, checking his<br>

    Never, sir.</p>

    I think he's been planted to draw<br>
    us into the Neutral Zone... we'd<br>

  <p> Setal is surprised by Riker's use of the Romulan word.<br>
    He gives him a grudging smile of respect. Riker<br>
    doesn't return the smile, but is determined to avoid<br>
    a confrontation, looking at Setal --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, please see to the<br>

  <p> Worf takes a beat, glances at Riker who doesn't look<br>
    back and then EXITS.</p>
  <p> A beat and then Setal erupts in LAUGHTER.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You find something amusing?</p>
  <p> SETAL<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, I like him. Or,<br>
    to be more accurate, I understand<br>
    him. He's a warrior. Proud,<br>
    fearless, living only for combat.<br>
    (the smile fading)<br>
    Exactly the type who will get us<br>

  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    Captain, we have received an<br>
    official protest from the Romulan<br>
    Empire demanding the return of<br>
    your defector. We are obviously<br>
    refusing to comply. I join in<br>
    your skepticism, but if it is a<br>
    deception, the Romulans are<br>
    certainly going all out to make<br>
    a good show of it. The<br>
    Federation Council has convened<br>
    in emergency session.<br>
    (more personal)<br>
    There's no doubt in my mind this<br>
    will eventually fall on your<br>
    shoulders, Jean-Luc. You've got<br>
    him. You must decide if he's<br>
    telling the truth. For now, I<br>
    suggest you proceed along the<br>
    Neutral Zone border toward a<br>
    Federation position proximate to<br>

    Troi. An n.d. security guard (the same one we've seen<br>

  <p> A flashing light on his chair indicates the<br>
    conversation is being recorded. Riker has a PADD with<br>

  <p> Picard is drinking tea as he plays back another<br>

  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    The Monitor and the Hood are<br>
    headed in your direction though<br>
    they will arrive too late to be<br>
    of assistance. Warnings have gone<br>

    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You wanted to see me, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, prepare a class one probe.<br>
    Set sensors for maximum scan.<br>
    I want every meter of Nelvana<br>

    I will start my calibrations, sir.</p>
  <p> He turns to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One moment.</p>
  <p> Data stops, waits patiently to hear what Picard has<br>

    Sit down.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you require something else from<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Your clarity of thought,<br>
    your objectivity... as always...<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We're very possibly about to go<br>
    to war, Data. The repercussions<br>
    of what we do during the next<br>
    twenty-four hours may be felt<br>
    for years to come. I'd like you<br>
    to keep the official record of<br>
    these events, so we may give<br>
    history the benefit of a<br>
    dispassionate view.</p>

    How are the crew's spirits?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are concerned, Captain, of<br>
    course. But confident. Can you<br>
    not see that yourself?</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What do you think? Is he a<br>

    that get in the way of human<br>
    judgment... that confuse the hell<br>
    out of us... that make us second<br>

  <p> Picard is willing to acknowledge that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On what basis shall I decide,<br>
    Admiral? Your good word? Are<br>
    you willing to reveal ways to<br>
    overpower the Romulan B-type<br>
    warbirds we may encounter? Are<br>
    you prepared to help us detect<br>
    them through their cloaking<br>
    shields?</p>
  <p> A long beat. Jarok does not want to answer. Picard<br>
    uses it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You see my problem, Admiral. You<br>
    ask us for faith in circumstances<br>
    not only difficult to believe but<br>
    compounded by your own lies, and<br>
    your own reluctance to tell us<br>
    all you know...</p>
  <p> JAROK<br>
    I cannot betray my people...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have already betrayed your<br>
    people. You have made your<br>
    choices. You are a traitor, sir.<br>
    If the bitter taste of it<br>
    disagrees with you, I am truly<br>
    sorry. But I will not risk the<br>
    lives of my crew because you think<br>
    you can dance on the edge of the<br>
    Neutral Zone. You have crossed<br>
    over, Admiral. I suggest you make<br>
    yourself comfortable.</p>
  <p> Jarok swallows hard, he knows he cannot ride the fence<br>
    much longer. He jumps off it in an odd direction...</p>
  <p> JAROK<br>
    Do you have children, Captain<br>
    Picard? A family?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> JAROK<br>
    Then you have sacrificed too much<br>

    There's a moment in a man's life,<br>

    when he looks down at the first<br>

    knows that he must change the<br>
    world for her... for all children.<br>
    It is for her that I am here.<br>
    Not to betray the Romulan Empire,<br>
    but to save it.</p>
  <p> He grows silent, downcast, shakes his head.</p>
  <p> JAROK<br>
    For months, I tried to persuade<br>
    the high command that another war<br>
    would destroy the empire. They<br>
    grew tired of my arguments, and<br>
    finally censored me, sent me off<br>
    to command a distant sector. This<br>
    was my only recourse. I will<br>
    never see my child smile again,<br>
    Captain. She will grow up<br>
    believing her father was a<br>
    traitor. But she will grow up.<br>

    daughter.</p>

    Sir, he must have known it would<br>
    be impossible for us to deliver<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Picard gives it to him, nods. A last look as they take<br>
    him away.</p>

    Today, perhaps... but if there<br>
    are others as courageous as<br>
    Admiral Jarok... there is hope<br>
    for a day of peace when we can<br>
    take his letter home.</p>
  <p> As they EXIT...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
