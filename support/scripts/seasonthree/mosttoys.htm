  In order to neutralize a sudden<br>

  at the Federation colony on Beta<br>

  from the pilot seat.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
  Because pure hytritium is too<br>
  unstable for our transporters,<br>
  Lieutenant Commander Data has been<br>
  shuttling the material to the<br>
  Enterprise.</p>
<p align="center"> VARRIA, a female humanoid, supervises THREE TECHNICIANS<br>
  who are moving a shipping case. The care and precision<br>
  with which they handle the case underlines the danger<br>
  involved.</p>
<p align="center"> Data opens the cargo door of the shuttlepod. The<br>
  technicians proceed to load the case onto the pod --<br>

<p align="center"> FADE IN:</p>
<p align="center">11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Wesley; moments later.<br>
  The debris from the destroyed shuttle is still visible<br>

  Unknown, Commander.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (to Worf)<br>
  Hail the Jovis -- I want to speak<br>
  with Kivas Fajo.</p>
<p align="center"> Geordi and Worf work their consoles.</p>

  Sir, Mister Fajo is hailing us.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  On screen.</p>
<p align="center">12 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> as the image of KIVAS FAJO fills the screen. Fajo is a<br>
  male Zibalian with a commanding presence; a man of the<br>
  world -- or rather the galaxy -- with undeniable<br>
  personal charm and grace and yet someone not to be<br>
  trifled with.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Captain Picard -- what happened?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  It is unclear at this time; we're<br>
  running a full analysis.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  We detected no malfunctions before<br>
  the explosion. Everything seemed<br>
  to be proceeding as smoothly as<br>
  the other flights. Were you able<br>
  to save the pilot?</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE 
  6.</p>
<p align="center">12 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  No.</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo looks as if he lost his best friend.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  I'm sorry.</p>
<p align="center"> Picard nods his thanks but, having a mission, cannot<br>
  dwell on the moment.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Mister Fajo, I would like to<br>
  analyze your sensor readings of<br>
  the explosion.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Compared to the Enterprise's, our<br>
  sensors are rather primitive --<br>
  I doubt they contain any<br>
  information yours have overlooked.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Perhaps, but I want to leave no<br>
  avenue unexplored.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  I understand. We'll transmit the<br>
  information.</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo nods to someone off screen.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  Link established... Receiving.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Can we be of any further<br>
  assistance?</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (to Riker)<br>
  How much hytritium did we manage<br>
  to bring on board?</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  Eighty-one kilos.</p>
<p align="center"> GEORDI<br>
  That might be barely enough to<br>
  complete our mission, Captain...<br>
  but it's not leaving us any margin<br>
  for error.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE 
  7.</p>
<p align="center">12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> Picard considers this, then:</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  (to Fajo)<br>
  I realize we have acquired your<br>
  complete supply of hytritium.<br>
  Do you know where we could obtain<br>
  more?</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  That may be difficult. The only<br>
  source I know is in the Sigma<br>
  Erani System.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  (to Picard)<br>
  Three weeks away.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  And I can't guarantee they'll have<br>
  any -- for obvious reasons, no<br>
  one wants to keep it around. In<br>
  fact, even I may stop selling<br>
  it -- it's just too dangerous.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  I guess we're fortunate you had<br>
  any at all, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> WORF<br>
  (to Picard)<br>
  Transfer of information is<br>
  complete, Captain.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Mister Fajo, thank you for your<br>
  help.</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo nods as his image disappears, replaced by the<br>
  Jovis and starfield and wreckage of the shuttlecraft.</p>
<p align="center">13 NEW ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> as Picard considers his options.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Mister Crusher, lay in a course<br>
  for Beta Agni Two, warp six.</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Aye, sir.</p>

<p align="center">13 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  (to Picard)<br>
  The Grissom is currently near<br>
  the Sigma Erani system... I'll<br>
  have them stand by in case we need<br>
  more hytritium.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Very good, Number One.</p>
<p align="center"> WESLEY<br>
  Course laid in, sir.</p>
<p align="center"> A beat as Picard looks out to his lost comrade.</p>
<p align="center"> PICARD<br>
  Engage.</p>
<p align="center">14 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> As the Enterprise BLASTS into warp, we hold on the<br>
  Jovis.</p>
<p align="center">15 INT. FAJO'S DEN</p>
<p align="center"> Data is &quot;unconscious&quot; on the floor. With a jolt, 
  he<br>
  snaps back to functional status, sits up, runs a quick<br>
  re-calibration.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (ad lib)<br>
  Gibberish...<br>
  (self-adjusting)<br>
  ...Starfleet... gibberish...<br>
  Enterprise.</p>
<p align="center"> That accomplished, he attempts to contact the<br>
  Enterprise -- but his insignia's missing.</p>
<p align="center"> Data gets to his feet, examines his environment. He's<br>
  in a windowless room filled with rare and beautiful<br>
  objects: paintings, sculpture, books, alien artifacts<br>
  and devices, perhaps even an exotic animal in a cage.<br>
  In the middle of the room is a large sofa -- a<br>
  comfortable place to sit and appreciate these<br>
  treasures.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE 
  8A.</p>
<p align="center">16 ON DATA</p>
<p align="center"> as he studies the collection. Right in its center --<br>
  the focal point of the room -- is a piece of simple,<br>
  unobtrusive framework in the rough shape of a chair.<br>
  Functional rather than comfortable, it's what you'd set<br>
  up if you had a seated statue you wanted to display.<br>
  But there's no statue there.</p>
<p align="center"> Data turns at the SOUND of a door opening --</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/27/90 - ACT ONE 
  9.</p>
<p align="center">17 NEW ANGLE</p>
<p align="center"> as the massive, vault-like door opens and Fajo and<br>
  Varria ENTER. The door immediately shuts and locks<br>
  behind them. Varria stays in the b.g. as Fajo crosses<br>
  to Data, looks him over with great interest and<br>
  delight. (Note: Fajo and Varria are wearing a small<br>
  device on their belts... and they never get closer<br>
  to Data than one meter.)</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Wondrous. The detail... the<br>
  balance. A remarkable piece of<br>
  work.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Why have I been brought here?</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  (ignores the question)<br>
  The voice simulation is perfect.<br>
  Inflections, timing...</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo shakes his head in admiration, speaks &quot;to&quot; Data<br>
  for the first time:</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO (cont'd)<br>
  It took a lot of effort to get<br>
  you here... but I was sure it<br>
  would be worth it. I was right.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  (patiently tries again)<br>
  I have been delivered here against<br>
  my wishes. I would like to know<br>
  the reason.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Certainly. You're here for my<br>
  enjoyment and appreciation.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Am I to infer that you intend to<br>
  keep me captive?</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Captive? A most inappropriate<br>
  description, my good android.<br>
  May I call you Data?</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  It is my name.</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/25/90 - ACT ONE 
  10.</p>
<p align="center">17 CONTINUED:</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  I know.<br>
  (beat, confident)<br>
  Data, you will be catered to,<br>
  fawned over... you will be cared<br>
  for as never before... every wish<br>
  will be fulfilled...</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  I wish to leave.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Almost every wish.</p>
<p align="center"> Data's puzzled.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  This is unacceptable. I have no<br>
  desire to remain here... and even<br>
  if I did, my Starfleet duties<br>
  would not permit it.</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo grins at Varria, like an amused parent whose child<br>
  has said something precious.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Single-minded, isn't it?</p>
<p align="center"> VARRIA<br>
  (nods)<br>
  Very persistent...</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  But polite. A nice touch.<br>
  (to Data)<br>
  I decline to allow you to leave.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Then I am forced to attempt<br>
  escape.</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo indicates the door -- &quot;go ahead.&quot; Data crosses 
  to<br>
  the door, inspects it. It's solid. Data braces<br>
  himself against the frame, gives the door a shove.<br>
  It doesn't budge.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO<br>
  Ten androids like you might be<br>
  able to force it open.<br>
  (shrugs)<br>
  But there aren't any other<br>
  androids like you, are there?</p>
<p align="center"> STAR TREK: &quot;The Most Toys&quot; - REV. 2/26/90 - ACT ONE 
  11.</p>
<p align="center">17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
<p align="center"> Data keeps inspecting the door, looking for access.<br>
  There's no visible keypad or opening device.</p>
<p align="center"> FAJO (cont'd)<br>
  It's keyed to the touch... reads<br>
  galvanic skin response, DNA<br>
  patterns, and two or three other<br>
  things. Trust me... you can't<br>
  open it.</p>
<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Then you will have to open it for<br>
  me.</p>
<p align="center">18 ON FAJO (OPTICAL)</p>
<p align="center"> Fajo doesn't move a muscle as Data advances toward him.<br>
  The instant Data comes within two meters of Fajo, a<br>
  GLOWING AURA appears around Fajo's body... Data<br>
  stiffens, nearly loses control of his movements. It's<br>
  all Data can do to stagger back from Fajo.</p>
<p align="center"> Once Data's backed off, the AURA DISAPPEARS, and Data<br>
  slowly recovers. Fajo smiles at him.</p>
<p align="center"> Data starts to turn away -- then with all his android<br>
  speed makes a leap-and-grab for Fajo. No good -- the<br>
  AURA appears again, knocking Data backwards. As he<br>
  does, the AURA DISAPPEARS. It takes several beats<br>
