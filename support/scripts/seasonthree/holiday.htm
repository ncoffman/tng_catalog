    &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p>1 INT. RISIAN PLEASURE HAVEN - THE LOBBY</p>
  <p> Imagine a twenty-fourth century Hawaiian resort. The<br>
    indoor/outdoor open-sided lobby (one end leads off to<br>
    a sun drenched lanai) has a simple grace and beauty<br>
    that is immediately apparent.</p>
  <p> In the center of the lobby is a stone shrine. Residing<br>
    on the alter is a large rotund idol (also made of<br>
    stone) called a Horga'hn. Smaller, wooden Horga'hns<br>
    circle the main figure.</p>
  <p> As for the guests, they all appear rested and happy.<br>
    Clothing is loose, casual and extremely revealing.<br>
    Couples predominate, with the spectrum of sexual<br>
    preferences being evident.</p>
  <p>2 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two sleek and well dressed aliens (Vorgons -- one male,<br>
    BORATUS, the other female, AJUR) MATERIALIZE by one<br>
    of the entranceways.</p>
  <p> The Vorgons glance curiously around the lobby then make<br>
    their way over to a nearby wall grid.</p>
  <p> Ajur places her palm on an adjoining sensor panel which<br>
    glows at her touch.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Welcome to Risa. All that is ours<br>
    is yours.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    We are looking for the lodging<br>
    chamber of Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> A beat as the computer accesses the data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    A file scan reveals no record of<br>
    a Captain Picard currently<br>
    visiting Risa.</p>
  <p> The Vorgons exchange a look of concern.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    When is he expected to arrive?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Where is no arrival date on file<br>
    for any such individual.</p>
  <p> Ajur removes her hand from the panel. It goes dark.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Could we have been mistaken?</p>
  <p> And when Ajur speaks, it is without the slightest hint<br>
    of doubt.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    He will come.</p>
  <p> HOLD ON the Vorgons. They look confident and slightly<br>
    ominous.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Slowly circling a cloud shrouded planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First officer's log, Stardate<br>
    43745.2. We are in orbit of<br>
    Gemaris Five where, for the past<br>
    two weeks, Captain Picard has been<br>
    serving as mediator in a trade<br>
    dispute between the Gemarians and<br>
    their nearest neighbor, the<br>
    Dachlyds.</p>
  <p>4 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA at Ops, ENSIGN BENNETT at Conn, WORF at Tactical.<br>
    RIKER standing by Command.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He greets TROI who has just entered from the aft<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome back, Counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's good to be back. It's been<br>
    a grueling two weeks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I take it the captain was able<br>
    to negotiate an agreement mutually<br>
    beneficial to both parties.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He did. Though I don't know how<br>
    he managed it. Both the Gemarians<br>
    and the Dachlyds are incredibly<br>
    stubborn people.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The more difficult the task, the<br>
    sweeter the victory.</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors re-open and out steps PICARD.<br>
    Though he moves with his usual determination, there is<br>
    a slight edge of weariness to his gestures. He<br>
    definitely does not act like a man who has just won a<br>
    &quot;sweet&quot; victory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Break us out of orbit, Mister<br>
    Bennett. Set a course for<br>
    Starbase twelve.</p>
  <p> Picard approaches the Command area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Report, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything status quo, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well...</p>
  <p> He glances around the bridge. Then abruptly:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If anyone needs me, I'll be in<br>
    my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir...</p>
  <p> Picard turns back in the doorway.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Congratulations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> PIKER<br>
    About the trade agreement.</p>
  <p> A beat, then Picard gives a brief nod of<br>
    acknowledgement before disappearing into his office.</p>
  <p> A puzzled Riker stares after him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Counselor, is it my imagination<br>
    or is something bothering the<br>
    captain?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He has been under a great deal<br>
    of strain lately. While on<br>
    Gemaris he ate sparingly... and<br>
    slept even less.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there anything we can do?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have a solution in mind, but<br>
    I doubt he'll agree to it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And what would that be?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (simply)<br>
    Our captain needs a vacation.</p>
  <p> An amused Riker smiles sympathetically. Troi is<br>
    absolutely right. The captain will never agree to it.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard at his desk studying a stack of reports. He<br>
    leans forward to stretch out a stiff back.</p>
  <p> The DOOR CHIME SOUNDS. Picard is too distracted to<br>
    respond. The CHIME SOUNDS again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY ENTERS. A woman with a mission.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sir, it's come to my attention<br>
    one of the crew has been<br>
    neglecting his health again.</p>
  <p> A warning light goes off in Picard's head. He sits up<br>
    a little straighter in his chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How so?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He suffers from a classic case<br>
    of stress related ailments brought<br>
    about by overwork. Exhaustion,<br>
    irritability... muscle spasms.<br>
    Yet he insists on ignoring them.</p>
  <p> Picard, who was just about to rub his aching back,<br>
    halts in mid-gesture. He's now certain he's the object<br>
    of Beverly's report.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It doesn't sound all that serious.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And I plan to keep it that way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Recommended treatment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A week's shore leave.</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head, dismissing the notion entirely.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Impossible.</p>
  <p> But Beverly comes right back at him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... I could make it an<br>
    order.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you won't... Beverly you know<br>
    I loathe vacations.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You loathe going on vacation.<br>
    Once you're there you have a<br>
    marvelous time. You told me you<br>
    loved the four days you spent on<br>
    Zytchin Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I lied.<br>
    (an idea)<br>
    The Enterprise is scheduled to<br>
    spend a week undergoing a<br>
    maintenance overhaul at Starbase<br>
    twelve. While there, I promise<br>
    to make full use of all available<br>
    recreation activities.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Watching some technician fill<br>
    deuterium tanks is not my idea<br>
    of fun.</p>
  <p> It doesn't sound like much fun to Picard either.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose I could find a few hours<br>
    to spend on the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Forget about the Holodeck. There<br>
    must be someplace you'd like to<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Astrophysics Center on Icor<br>
    Nine is holding a symposium on rogue<br>
    star clusters. I had given serious<br>
    thought to attending.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Serious thought is the last thing<br>
    you need. Why not go some place<br>
    beautiful? Where you can relax<br>
    and be pampered. You deserve it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> But Picard isn't ready to commit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll give it serious thought.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (insistent)<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly... enough.</p>
  <p> Beverly sighs and backs off. Picard returns to his<br>
    reports, confident that he's dodged that particular<br>
    bullet.</p>
  <p>5A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship cruising at warp speed.</p>
  <p>5B INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are headed towards a turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So have you decided where you're<br>
    going yet?</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open. Picard and Riker ENTER.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Continuous.<br>
    PICARD<br>
    Yes Number One, I have.<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    The bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I meant for your shore leave.</p>
  <p> Picard glares at his first officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not you too.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Halt.</p>
  <p> The turbolift stops. A smiling Riker launches into<br>
    his sales pitch.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know this perfect little<br>
    vacation spot... In fact, its<br>
    co-ordinates lie within this<br>
    sector.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How convenient. Except I have<br>
    absolutely no intention of taking<br>
    a holiday. Do I make myself<br>
    clear?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very clear...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. I'm glad we've got that<br>
    straightened out.<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Resume.</p>
  <p> The turbolift continues on its way. Riker, realizing<br>
    he doesn't have much time left, presses on.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's called Risa. And believe<br>
    me Captain, it's paradise. Warm<br>
    tropical breezes... exotic food...<br>
    and nothing to do but sit back<br>
    and enjoy the quiet.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    And then there's --</p>
  <p> Picard anticipates Riker's next thought.</p>
  <p> PICARD &amp; RIKER<br>
    (together)<br>
    ... the women...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure you'd find their<br>
    sybaritic outlook on life very<br>
    appealing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure I would.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks he has the captain sold. The turbolift<br>
    doors open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm glad to hear you say so, sir.</p>
  <p>7<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    9</p>
  <p>9A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As Picard and Riker EXIT the aft turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Unfortunately, this vessel is<br>
    about to undergo extensive<br>
    repairs requiring my personal<br>
    supervision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But what about Risa?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some other time, Number One.</p>
  <p> Troi is on her way over to the turbolift. Perhaps a<br>
    brief conspiratorial look passes between her and Riker<br>
    before she speaks.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Will, I've just received some<br>
    delightful news.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> And we get the feeling that what follows is said more<br>
    for Picard's benefit than for Riker's.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's an excellent chance my<br>
    mother may be meeting us at<br>
    Starbase twelve.</p>
  <p> To Picard this sounds anything but &quot;delightful.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your mother?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, she's returning home from<br>
    a conference on Achrady Seven.<br>
    She's going to try to rearrange<br>
    her schedule so she can spend some<br>
    time visiting with us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's wonderful, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She mentioned how much she's<br>
    looking forward to seeing you<br>
    again, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did she?</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS the turbolift.</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors close. Picard is only too well<br>
    aware of how &quot;fond&quot; Lwaxana can be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, I'd like a word with<br>
    you. In private.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS the Ready Room. Riker follows.</p>
  <p>9B INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is something wrong, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me, Number One, is the entire<br>
    crew aware of this little scheme<br>
    to send me off on holiday?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>9B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (fighting back a smile)<br>
    I believe there are two ensigns<br>
    stationed on deck thirty-nine who<br>
    know nothing about it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose this means I can look<br>
    forward to a week of continual<br>
    harassment on the subject.</p>
  <p> Riker's look says he wouldn't be at all surprised. A<br>
    beat as Picard decides it's not really worth the fight.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I admit I have been feeling a bit<br>
    fatigued.</p>
  <p> Hold on Picard having made his decision.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE13-13A. 
  </p>
  <p>9BA EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> coming out of warp and approaching Risa.</p>
  <p>9C INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The ship is out of warp. Picard, dressed in casual<br>
    clothing, is packing up some books to take with him on<br>
    his trip. Riker and Troi are there to see him off.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll see to it that these bags are<br>
    beamed directly to your room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>9C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi leans over and unbuttons the top button of the<br>
    Captain's shirt. That feels better.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You look very handsome, Captain...<br>
    If you don't mind my saying so.</p>
  <p> Riker looks over at the stack of books lying atop a<br>
    travel bag.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're not really bringing all<br>
    these books with you?</p>

  <p>9C CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought I'd take along some<br>
    light reading... in case I got<br>
    bored.</p>
  <p> Riker checks out some of the titles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ulysses by James Joyce? Ethics,<br>
    Sophistry and the Alternate<br>
    Universe by Ving Kuda -- You call<br>
    this light reading?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To each his own, Number One.</p>
  <p> Picard closes up the bag. As he starts out of the<br>
    room:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did I ever mention how imaginative<br>
    Risian women are?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Too often, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker looks over at Troi. Could there have been a<br>
    slight trace of jealousy in the counselor's remark?</p>
  <p>9D INT. CORRIDOR LEADING TO TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi and Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I do have one request.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You want me to bring you back a<br>
    souvenir?</p>
  <p> How did he know?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's called a Horga'hn. You won't<br>
    have any trouble finding one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Consider it done.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT ONE 15A.</p>
  <p>9E NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> WORF and a security guard are waiting outside the<br>
    Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I would feel better if you<br>
    would allow me to assign a<br>
    security officer to accompany you.<br>
    We will be out of communication<br>
    range as soon as we leave orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think that will be<br>
    necessary, Lieutenant. Risa has<br>
    a reputation of being a most<br>
    peaceful planet.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 16.</p>

  <p> Picard realizes there's no use in putting it off any<br>
    longer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The ship is yours, Number One.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Enjoy your trip, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll try, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS the Transporter Room. As the doors<br>
    close, Riker turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's going to have a great time.</p>

  <p>11 INT. RISIAN PLEASURE HAVEN - THE LOBBY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard MATERIALIZES. A glance at the blissful faces of<br>
    the other guests only serves to convince him that it's<br>
    going to be a long week.</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A woman, VASH, mid-thirties, striking good looks, moves<br>
    away from the pond, where she has stood admiring the<br>
    shrine of the Horga'hn. She casts a backward glance<br>
    at the idols.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She and Picard are on a collision course, and sure<br>
    enough, they come together with a jolt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pardon me.</p>
  <p> Vash is about to answer back when something catches her<br>
    eye in the entranceway behind Picard. What happens<br>
    next is quite fast.</p>
  <p>13 VASH'S P.O.V.</p>
  <p> SOVAK, a Ferengi has just arrived at the Haven. His<br>
    eyes search the room.</p>
  <p>14 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Vash moves slightly to the side so that Picard's body<br>
    will block her from Sovak's sightline. Her eyes light<br>
    up as she suddenly &quot;recognizes&quot; Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    It's so good to see you again.</p>
  <p> Before Picard can react, she throws her arms around his<br>
    neck and gives him an enthusiastic kiss.</p>
  <p> Her eyes remain open and she sees that Sovak has<br>
    spotted her anyway. At first the Ferengi looks as if<br>
    he's going to approach her, but he thinks better of<br>
    it and with an ugly grin, moves away.</p>
  <p> A relieved Vash then gazes over at Picard whose eyes<br>
    have stayed open as well. For a beat, they stare at<br>
    one another, lips pressed together. Then Picard breaks<br>
    the embrace.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think you've mistaken me for<br>
    someone else.</p>
  <p> Vash studies Picard's face closely and then reacts.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You know, I believe you're right.</p>
  <p> She shrugs, and then flashes a very provocative smile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT ONE 18.</p>

  <p> VASH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Welcome to Risa.</p>
  <p> She strolls away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    A simple handshake would have<br>
    sufficed.</p>
  <p> He walks off. The CAMERA follows him only to stop when<br>
    he reaches:</p>
  <p>15 THE VORGONS</p>
  <p> who study him closely as he walks by. A meaningful<br>
    look passes between them, as we:</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 INT. LANAI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Another perfect day at the Pleasure Haven. The<br>
    temperature is the equivalent of a balmy eighty-three<br>
    degrees Fahrenheit; a warm breeze prevents the heat<br>
    from becoming oppressive, and the water (you'll have to<br>
    take my word for it because we never get to see the<br>
    ocean) is as clear and calm as a lake.</p>
  <p> The CAMERA OPENS on a happy couple, lying asleep on the<br>
    veranda. CAMERA PANS over to a second couple, kissing<br>
    passionately. CAMERA PANS again to REVEAL:</p>
  <p>17 PICARD</p>
  <p> Sitting in a lounge chair, trying to concentrate on the<br>
    thick tome he's reading. It's not as simple as it<br>
    would appear. First of all, it's not easy to relax<br>
    with a couple locked in the throes of lust only a few<br>
    feet away. For a private man like Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    such public behavior is distasteful at best. Then<br>
    another couple comes running up from the unseen beach.<br>
    The water from their still dripping bodies sprays over<br>
    him. Annoyed, he carefully wipes dry his book.</p>
  <p>18 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As he settles back down, a hoverball glides over to<br>
    him and stops dead in the air only inches from his<br>
    face. Picard tries to ignore it but the sphere emits<br>
    an aggravating low level HUM. He casually tries to<br>
    swat it away but it avoids his hand and darts away.<br>
    Picard reopens his book... just as the hoverball makes<br>
    an abrupt reappearance above his head. As he looks<br>
    up:</p>
  <p> JOVAL (V.O.)<br>
    Return.</p>
  <p> The hoverball zips away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> to include Joval, a delicate beauty wearing an eye<br>
    catching bathing outfit. She grabs hold of the<br>
    hoverball.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    My apologies. I fear I have yet<br>
    to master the art of hoverball.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So it would seem.</p>
  <p> Joval sits beside him.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    My name is Joval. I am employed<br>
    here. Is there anything you<br>
    require to make your stay a more<br>
    pleasant one?</p>
  <p> A small smile from Picard. He shakes his head as if<br>
    he's heard it all before.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    You find me amusing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. It's just that you're the<br>
    fifth woman to ask me that this<br>
    morning... All I require is to<br>
    sit here in the sun and read my<br>
    book. Alone.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    And afterward?</p>
  <p> The question catches Picard by surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I really haven't thought that far<br>
    ahead.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    Then may I suggest a swim to be<br>
    followed by a massage?</p>
  <p> This is all said very matter of fact, without any hint<br>
    of salaciousness and no trace of servitude.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Some other time perhaps.</p>
  <p> Picard was hoping this would end matters right there,<br>
    but Joval only looks perplexed.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    I don't understand. You say you<br>
    wish to be alone yet you carry<br>
    the Horga'hn.</p>
  <p> She holds up a small wooden copy of the idol which is<br>
    on a table next to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I just purchased that.<br>
    (suddenly suspicious)<br>
    Why? Are you implying it holds<br>
    some special meaning?</p>
  <p> Joval looks at him like he has got to be kidding.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    The Horga'hn is the Risian<br>
    symbol of sexuality. To own<br>
    one is to call forth it powers.<br>
    To display it is to announce you<br>
    are seeking Jamaharohn.</p>
  <p> Picard glares at the Horga'hn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly but<br>
    emphatically)<br>
    Riker!</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    Do you seek Jamaharohn?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't even know what it means.<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Nor do I want to. The Horga'hn<br>
    is for a friend.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    I see. Someone close to you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    Someone you love.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wouldn't go that far.</p>
  <p> Joval stands.</p>
  <p> JOVAL<br>
    Your attitude is most puzzling.<br>
    I will leave you now to your book.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's all I ask.</p>
  <p> And with a final look of disapproval, Joval leaves.</p>
  <p> As for Picard, the conversation has done nothing to<br>
    improve his mood. Once again, he opens the book, tries<br>
    to make himself comfortable.</p>
  <p> After a beat, an ominous shadow falls over him. He<br>
    looks up to see:</p>
  <p>20 PICARD'S P.O.V.</p>
  <p> A dark figure who stands backlit before him.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    You're blocking the sun.</p>
  <p> The figure leans forward into the CAMERA and now we<br>
    realize it's Sovak, the Ferengi, looking rather absurd<br>
    in a Risian resort outfit.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    I know you're working with her.<br>
    I warn you, it's a mistake.</p>
  <p>21 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard looks around, convinced that Sovak must be<br>
    speaking to someone else. But no one's there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you addressing me?</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Don't bother to deny it. I've<br>
    seen the two of you together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know what the devil you're<br>
    talking about. But whatever it<br>
    is, I assure you it's no concern<br>
    of mine.</p>
  <p> Picard goes back to his book, trying his best to ignore<br>
    the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Tell her I want the disc returned<br>
    to me immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps I haven't made myself<br>
    clear. You have the wrong man.</p>
  <p>22 ANGLE ON VASH</p>
  <p> who is seated in a lounge chair at the edge of the<br>
    lobby. A male companion is giving her a backrub as she<br>
    watches Picard and Sovak.</p>
  <p>23 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    I am rapidly losing patience with<br>
    you. I demand you talk business.</p>
  <p> Picard has had about enough of this guy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll find Ferengi demands carry<br>
    little weight with me.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Obviously you've never dealt with<br>
    my people before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On the contrary, I have. All too<br>
    often.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Then you know the Ferengi are not<br>
    to be trifled with.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or trusted.</p>
  <p> Sovak looks threateningly over him.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    You dare to insult me!</p>
  <p> Picard rises to his feet. The Ferengi stands his<br>
    ground.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I advise you to listen closely<br>
    for I will not say this again.<br>
    I came to Risa for a holiday,<br>
    nothing more. I have no knowledge<br>
    of this woman you refer to, nor<br>
    have I laid eyes on any disc.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    You expect me to believe such<br>
    feeble lies?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with an edge)<br>
    I don't particularly care what<br>
    you believe.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard stares down Sovak. Finally the<br>
    Ferengi backs away.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    This is not over yet, human. The<br>
    disc is mine... And so is the<br>
    woman. Remember that.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi EXITS into the lobby.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a deep breath, allowing the tension to<br>
    drain out of him. He sits back down and once again<br>
    opens the book.</p>
  <p> VASH (V.O.)<br>
    Hello!</p>
  <p> Picard slams the book shut.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He turns, sees Vash standing by the doorway of the<br>
    lanai. Her outfit leaves little to the imagination.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh, it's you.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's not much of a greeting.</p>
  <p> Undeterred, she sits down beside him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Look, I don't mean to appear rude,<br>
    but I am not seeking Jamaharohn.</p>
  <p> At first Vash appears perplexed, but then she smiles<br>
    and nods philosophically.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    All right. But you really should<br>
    try it some time.</p>
  <p> And it's clear that Vash knows of what she speaks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I &quot;try it&quot;, it will be at a<br>
    time of my own choosing.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's fine with me. It's not<br>
    as though I was offering to help<br>
    you find it.</p>
  <p> And now it's Picard who's a bit taken back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assumed by the way you welcomed<br>
    me the other day...</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't recall saying I was<br>
    embarrassed.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Do public displays of affection<br>
    normally make you uncomfortable?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's just say I prefer to be<br>
    acquainted with the women I kiss.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's understandable. The name's<br>
    Vash.</p>
  <p> She holds out her hand. And for a brief moment before<br>
    Picard takes it, they stare at each other in an<br>
    undeniable beat of sexual tension.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    So tell me about yourself,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (scowling)<br>
    Is that really necessary?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Would you rather I guess? I can<br>
    be very persistent.</p>
  <p> Picard sees she means it. If only to get it over<br>
    with...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm captain of a Federation<br>
    starship.</p>
  <p> Vash is impressed.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Well then that explains it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explains what?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I noticed you arguing with that<br>
    Ferengi. For a moment there it<br>
    looked like it was going to come<br>
    to blows.</p>
  <p> And suddenly it all clicks into place for Picard.</p>

  <p>23 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Vash tries to keep it light but there's a hint of worry<br>
    in her voice.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I hope your disagreement wasn't<br>
    over me.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For the answer to that I suggest<br>
    you ask him.</p>
  <p> He reaches down and picks up his book and Riker's<br>
    Horga'hn.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Where are you going?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To find some privacy.</p>
  <p> He walks off towards the lobby. Vash gets up to<br>
    follow.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Wait a second.</p>
  <p>24 INT. LOBBY</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash ENTER from the lanai.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    What did he tell you? I'm sure<br>
    there wasn't a bit of truth to<br>
    any of it.</p>

    blocks their path.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    And you said you didn't know her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't. And I don't want to.</p>

  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    Return the disc to me and all will<br>
    be forgiven.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    The disc doesn't belong to you,<br>
    Sovak. It never did.</p>
  <p> Picard has no intention of staying around to hear them<br>
    argue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would seem you two have a lot<br>
    to discuss. If you'll excuse<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> He starts to go, but Vash stops him.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm sorry, Jean-Luc. Perhaps one<br>
    day I can explain this all to you.</p>
  <p>26 INSERT</p>
  <p> As she slips an optical disc into his coat pocket.</p>
  <p>27 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you can.</p>
  <p> And with that, he leaves. Vash watches him go. Sovak<br>
    appears at her shoulder.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    I have a proposal I believe you'll<br>
    find most interesting.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Save your breath.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    I am willing to pay you your<br>
    weight in gold in exchange for<br>
    the disc. Is that not a generous<br>
    offer?</p>

  <p>30 INT. PICARD'S ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and the Vorgons as before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's assume for the moment I<br>
    believe you. That you are indeed<br>
    from the future. What is it that<br>
    you want from me?</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    Have you heard of the Tox Uthat?</p>
  <p> The question surprises Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of the legend. It tells<br>
    of a visitor from the future who<br>
    left behind a mysterious device<br>
    known as the Tox Uthat.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    Essentially that story is correct.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then the Uthat actually exists.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    It was invented by a scientist<br>
    named Kal Dano in the mid-twenty-seventh<br>
    century. The Uthat is a<br>
    quantum phase inhibitor... capable<br>
    of halting all nuclear reaction<br>
    within a star.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But why bring such a powerful<br>
    weapon into the past?</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Criminals attempted to steal the<br>
    device from Dano. He was<br>
    determined to keep it out of their<br>
    hands, so he fled back to the<br>
    twenty-second century... where<br>
    he hid it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Ajur and I were the security team<br>
    assigned to protect the Uthat.<br>
    Having failed in our duty, we<br>
    followed Dano into the past,<br>
    hoping to return him and the<br>
    weapon safely to our own time.</p>
  <p> One look at the aliens tells Picard all he needs to<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I gather you were unsuccessful.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    Though we searched for many years,<br>
    we were unable to find any trace<br>
    of it.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Returning home in defeat we began<br>
    to search through the historical<br>
    records for some clue to the<br>
    Uthat's fate.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    For years we looked through the<br>
    archives of the many cultures that<br>
    reside in this part of the galaxy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the search led you to me?</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    We came upon a brief account<br>
    stating you had discovered an<br>
    object of unknown origin while<br>
    vacationing on Risa. From its<br>
    description -- a crystal cube that<br>
    fits in the palm of the hand -- we<br>
    surmised it could very well be<br>
    the Uthat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry to disappoint you, but<br>
    I haven't found a thing -- including<br>
    peace, which is the only thing<br>
    I'm looking for.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    You will find such a device,<br>
    Captain -- to us it's already part<br>
    of history.</p>
  <p> It's a difficult argument for Picard to refute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if I do find it, what then?</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    You will give it to us immediately<br>
    so that we may return with it.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Can we expect your cooperation,<br>
    Picard?</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates before replying. There is no way to<br>
    verify the Vorgon's story -- and his instincts are<br>
    whispering caution. His answer is subtly ambiguous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Uthat belongs to your time<br>
    -- not mine.</p>
  <p> Upon hearing Picard's answer, the aliens seem to relax<br>
    for the first time.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    It would appear that history is<br>
    correct in its assessment of you,<br>
    Captain. You are a very wise man.</p>
  <p> And with that, the Vorgons touch their transporter<br>
    belts and DEMATERIALIZE (VORGON TRANSPORTER EFFECT).</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to their abrupt departure, not sure<br>
    whether Ajur's last remark was a compliment or a subtly<br>
    veiled threat. He takes off his jacket and as he does,<br>
    Vash's optical disc drops to the floor. He picks it up<br>
    and examines it closely.</p>
  <p>31 INT. VASH'S ROOM (A REDRESS OF PICARD'S)</p>
  <p> Vash is busy gathering up her belongings which have<br>
    been tossed helter-skelter around the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT THREE 32A.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    May I come in?</p>
  <p> She turns quickly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/24/90 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>32 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard is standing in the doorway.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Excuse the mess.</p>
  <p> She returns to her work.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Sovak has taken to searching my<br>
    room periodically.</p>
  <p> Picard holds up the disc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this what he's looking for?</p>
  <p> An apologetic Vash reacts to the sight of the disc.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm sorry I had to hide it like<br>
    that, but I was afraid he'd start<br>
    searching me next.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This disc must contain some very<br>
    valuable information.</p>
  <p> Vash reaches out her hand, waits for Picard to give it<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I doubt it's anything you'd be<br>
    interested in.</p>
  <p> But Picard holds on to the disc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That depends.</p>
  <p> And now Vash isn't as calm as she was a moment before.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    On what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On whether or not this has<br>
    anything to do with the Tox Uthat.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (a flash of anger)<br>
    Did Sovak tell you that?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's just say I've heard...<br>
    rumors that the Uthat is located<br>
    somewhere on Risa.</p>
  <p> Vash tries to gauge just how much Picard knows. But<br>
    he's a hard man to read.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Look, the last thing I need is<br>
    a partner.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it's true.</p>
  <p> Vash sees that Picard is not about to let go of this.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I don't suppose you ever heard<br>
    of Professor Samuel Estragon?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As a matter of fact, I have. He<br>
    spent half his life searching for<br>
    the Uthat.<br>
    (off her reaction)<br>
    Archaeology is a hobby of mine.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I served as his personal<br>
    assistant for the past five years.<br>
    Shortly before he died, he<br>
    uncovered new data pinpointing<br>
    its location. That disc contains<br>
    his research notes and maps.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So you're continuing his work?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With a Ferengi as an associate.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Sovak and I are definitely not<br>
    working together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the two of you are well<br>
    acquainted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 34A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    At times he aided the professor<br>
    in his explorations. Especially<br>
    in situations that weren't quite<br>
    ethical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And now with typical Ferengi<br>
    logic, he's convinced that the<br>
    Uthat belongs to him.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    All he cares about is selling it<br>
    to the highest bidder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I take it you have a more noble<br>
    purpose in mind.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I told the professor I'd present<br>
    it to the Daystrom Institute.<br>
    (with a hint of anxiety)<br>
    But first I have to find it.<br>
    And that won't be easy with Sovak<br>
    watching me every minute.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> And to Picard it's as if fate itself has brought him to<br>
    this moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I'll go in your place.</p>
  <p> Vash reacts. Not so fast buddy.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    And what about me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll remain here. It's safer.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    This isn't a starship, Jean-Luc.<br>
    And I don't follow orders.</p>
  <p> A beat as they stare at each other.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You'd never find it without me.<br>
    The professor's notes are in code.</p>
  <p> She smiles triumphantly. Picard grudgingly accepts<br>
    the inevitable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> In spite of himself, Picard is beginning to admire this<br>
    brash woman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    From the moment we met I knew you<br>
    were going to be trouble.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You look like a man who could<br>
    handle trouble.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How far is it to our destination?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    According to the professor's notes,<br>
    a series of subterranrean caves lie<br>
    twenty-nine kilometers due east.<br>
    That's where we'll find the Uthat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll meet you in the lobby in<br>
    fifteen minutes. Be punctual.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I advise you to change clothing.</p>
  <p> He heads for the door.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> He turns.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    ... We're going to make a wonderful<br>
    team.</p>
  <p> Picard isn't quite so confident. He EXITS.</p>
  <p>33 INT. LOBBY</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash move quickly through the lobby. Vash<br>
    is carrying a back pack.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>34 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Sovak appears at their side.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    I expected such treachery. Did<br>
    you think you could sneak away<br>
    from me so easily?</p>
  <p>35 INSERT</p>
  <p> A small phaser is pressed against Picard's back.</p>
  <p>36 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> As Picard and Vash react.</p>
  <p>37 INT. LOBBY - THE LANAI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash ENTER, followed by Sovak. As they turn<br>
    to face him:</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    The disc -- where is it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Didn't anyone tell you weapons<br>
    aren't allowed on Risa?</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    You're making a grave mistake<br>
    putting your trust in this woman.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    It would be a worse mistake to<br>
    trust you.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Silence!<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Do you know how she acquired the<br>
    disc in the first place?</p>
  <p> Vash starts toward the Ferengi.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (a warning)<br>
    Sovak!</p>
  <p> He points the phaser in her direction, effectively<br>
    stopping her in her tracks. Sovak smiles. He's<br>
    enjoying this.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I paid her to steal it. But<br>
    instead she betrayed me, and<br>
    used my money to make her way<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's not the way it happened.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (relishing it)<br>
    She's a greedy and unscrupulous<br>
    woman.<br>
    (drooling over Vash)<br>
    A perfect mate for a Ferengi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are becoming quite an<br>
    annoyance, Sovak.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    As are you, human. Perhaps I<br>
    should kill you and then take the<br>
    disc.</p>
  <p> Vash moves forward, holding out the back pack.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    No wait... you can have it.</p>
  <p> A greedy Sovak, anticipating victory, reaches for the<br>
    bag. Vash tosses it to him. A surprised Sovak catches<br>
    it. Picard uses the opportunity to grab for the phaser.<br>
    The Ferengi FIRES it, the beam passing between Picard<br>
    and Vash. A solid punch from the captain and Sovak<br>
    crumples to the ground.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the phaser and tosses it in the bushes. He<br>
    picks up the back pack.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You see, I told you we'd make a<br>
    good team.</p>
  <p> Picard still isn't totally convinced. He leads her<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have a long trip ahead of us.</p>
  <p> They EXIT the lanai.</p>
  <p> Hold a beat, and then the Vorgons MATERIALIZE (VORGON<br>
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT).</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    So it finally begins.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Picard must not be allowed to<br>
    destroy the Uthat.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    He will surrender it to us...<br>
    or die.</p>
  <p> And on two very grim and determined Vorgons, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>38 INT. CAVERN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A dark, primeval place. Shafts of moonlight emanating<br>
    from natural fissures in the ceiling provide the only<br>
    illumination.</p>
  <p> Picard is finishing up some dinner as he stands gazing<br>
    off into the shadows. Behind him is a small, grassy<br>
    chamber. He turns and ENTERS -- revealing a weary Vash<br>
    resting on the ground. She holds a tricorder-like<br>
    device (the disc is inside) as she checks the<br>
    professor's maps.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you calculated how much<br>
    further we have to go?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Another eleven kilometers.</p>
  <p> Picard is well aware they both could use a rest.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll remain here for the night.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I was hoping you'd say that.</p>
  <p> She flops onto her back, arms outstretched. Picard<br>
    sits with his back to the cave wall.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We made better time than I<br>
    expected.</p>
  <p> Vash leans up on her elbows.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'll take that as a compliment.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As it was intended.</p>
  <p> Vash sits up -- moves closer to Picard. She hesitates<br>
    -- looking for the right words... Totally serious for<br>
    a change.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/25/90 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc... I'm afraid I haven't<br>
    been totally honest with you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Forgive me if I don't act<br>
    surprised.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Sovak did pay me to hand over the<br>
    disc.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you did steal it.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    It wasn't stealing. The professor<br>
    was dead... Someone had to<br>
    continue his work. I had already<br>
    devoted five years of my life to<br>
    tracking down the Uthat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you took Sovak's money.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    It was the only way I could afford<br>
    to get to Risa. As for Sovak,<br>
    he got exactly what he deserved.</p>
  <p> Picard gives a wry grin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, any woman who can beat a<br>
    Ferengi at his own game, bears<br>
    watching.</p>
  <p> Vash is delighted to return Picard's smile.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'll take that as another<br>
    compliment. I am flattered.</p>
  <p> A silent moment passes between them. Then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gruffly)<br>
    We should get some sleep.</p>
  <p> Vash turns and rummages through the pack. She pulls<br>
    out a blanket (perhaps some kind of sleeping bag.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You know Jean-Luc, it's lucky for<br>
    you we met.</p>
  <p> Picard flashes Vash a dubious look as he helps her<br>
    spread out the blanket.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    If it wasn't for me, you'd still<br>
    be back there sitting in the<br>
    sun... relaxing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That happens to be why I came to<br>
    Risa.</p>
  <p> They both slip under the blanket. Settle in.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm sure you hated every minute<br>
    of it. That kind of vacation isn't<br>
    for a man like you. You need<br>
    excitement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excitement? Sleeping in a damp<br>
    cave... chasing after something<br>
    we'll probably never find?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (confident)<br>
    You are enjoying yourself, aren't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> A beat and then Picard allows himself a small grin.<br>
    There's no use denying it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suppose I am.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (victory)<br>
    I just wanted to hear you say it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Now go to sleep.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard closes his eyes. Vash looks over at<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'll never forget that look on<br>
    your face when you thought I was<br>
    offering you Jamaharon.</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That was a simple<br>
    misunderstanding.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You did seem a little disappointed<br>
    when I turned you down.</p>
  <p> Picard rises up on an elbow, leans towards Vash.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You can be the most irritating<br>
    woman sometimes.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    You're kind of prickly yourself.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Don't you see, we're a lot alike.<br>
    That's probably why we get along<br>
    so well.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You call this getting along?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    All right. We don't get along.</p>
  <p> She moves up into a reclining position alongside<br>
    Picard... and now their faces are only inches apart.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (softly)<br>
    But you do admit we're attracted<br>
    to one another.</p>
  <p> A long beat of sexual tension and Picard's response<br>
    is more an admission than a denial.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do I?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    If you want to pretend otherwise,<br>
    that's fine with me, but...</p>
  <p> But before she can continue, Picard moves forward that<br>
    last inch and kisses her.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You still think I'm trouble?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure of it.</p>
  <p> They kiss again... and it grows more passionate. She<br>
    lowers him down over her.</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
  <p>39 OMITTED</p>
  <p>39A INT. CAVERNS</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash hiking along. Picard wears the back<br>
    pack.</p>
  <p>40 INT. CAVERNS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A vaulted cul-de-sac.</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash ENTER. Look around. Vash can barely<br>
    contain her excitement as she consults her tricorder.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    This is it. We've reached the<br>
    end of our journey.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have an exact location?</p>

  <p> VASH<br>
    (reading off the disc)<br>
    Six meters in from the large<br>
    outcropping.</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash find the outcropping. Picard paces off<br>
    the distance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That should put it right about<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Vash scans the spot with her tricorder. A frown slips<br>
    across her face. She scans the rest of the chamber,<br>
    her frown deepening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I can't get a reading. There must<br>
    be Starithium ore in these rocks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That leaves us but one<br>
    alternative.</p>
  <p> He reaches into the pack and pulls out a collapsible<br>
    shovel -- hands it to Vash. Then takes out another for<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Shall we?</p>
  <p> Vash nods. Picard buries the shovel into the ground.</p>
  <p> At the moment of impact, the Vorgons MATERIALIZE into<br>
    the chamber. (VORGON MATERIALIZATION EFFECT.)</p>
  <p> Vash reacts to the intrusion -- what new enemy is this?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (wielding her shovel;<br>
    help)<br>
    Picard!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (seeing it's the<br>
    Vorgons)<br>
    A bit early, aren't you?</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    We are here to witness a great<br>
    moment, Picard.</p>
  <p> Vash looks over at Picard, demanding an explanation.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Who the hell are they?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're security officers from<br>
    the twenty-seventh century.<br>
    They're here to take back the<br>
    Uthat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Vash is torn between amazement and anger.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You knew about this and didn't<br>
    tell me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My apologies Vash... But if I<br>
    had told you, would you have<br>
    brought me here?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Probably not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My point exactly.</p>
  <p> SOVAK (O.S.)<br>
    So the betrayer is herself<br>
    betrayed.</p>
  <p>41 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Sovak ENTERS the vault carrying a phaser rifle at the<br>
    ready. He reacts to the Vorgons.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    You've put together quite a little<br>
    team.</p>
  <p> Ajur advances towards Sovak.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    You must not interrupt Captain<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> Sovak points the rifle at the Vorgon.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Quiet. Move back with the<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> Ajur and Boratus comply and move closer to Picard and<br>
    Vash.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (coldly to Sovak)<br>
    How did you get here?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    I found the disc in her room.</p>
  <p> Picard looks over at Vash. Can this be true?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's impossible. I made a copy<br>
    as a precaution. But I burned<br>
    it before we left.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Only the outer casing was<br>
    incinerated. Now, I had no<br>
    intention of interrupting you.<br>
    Please...<br>
    (harshly)<br>
    Continue digging.</p>
  <p> A beat. Neither Picard or Vash move. Sovak FIRES<br>
    the phaser rifle into the air. A defiant Vash drives<br>
    her shovel into the dirt. Picard looks over at the<br>
    Vorgons. No help there. For the time being, there's<br>
    only one thing to do.</p>
  <p> And as Picard begins to dig, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>42 INT. CAVERN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard climbs out of a hole that has grown waist deep<br>
    and five feet wide. Vash continues to shovel away --<br>
    under the watchful eyes of the Vorgons and an<br>
    increasingly anxious Sovak.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    No one told you to stop digging,<br>
    human.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see no reason to continue.</p>
  <p> Now Vash has stopped digging as well. Sovak fires a<br>
    shot from the phaser rifle.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    You will do as I say. Now pick<br>
    up that shovel!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Look around Sovak, by now it must<br>
    be obvious even to you... the<br>
    Uthat is not here.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Is this some pathetic attempt at<br>
    trickery? Of course it's here.<br>
    We simply haven't found it yet.</p>
  <p> Vash approaches Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Are you saying the professor's<br>
    findings were wrong?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would appear so.</p>
  <p> Picard's words seem to be making a strong impact on<br>
    Vash. It's as if she's struggling to accept the truth.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (bewildered)<br>
    But how could that be? His<br>
    evidence was overwhelming.</p>
  <p> Sovak's rage and panic is building.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Enough with this foolishness.<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    Can't you see he's trying to<br>
    deceive us?<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Return to work this instant!</p>
  <p>43 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Vash gives Sovak a sympathetic look.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I'm afraid he's right, Sovak.<br>
    According to the disc we should<br>
    have reached it hours ago.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (panic rising)<br>
    Lies! Treachery! This cannot<br>
    be happening. Not another<br>
    failure. Not after having come<br>
    so close.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    It is most puzzling.</p>
  <p> And with that, the Vorgons beam out. (VORGON<br>
    TRANSPORTER EFFECT.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firmly)<br>
    It's over, Sovak.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    No, I will not be cheated out of<br>
    my prize.<br>
    (to Vash)<br>
    Tell him. Tell him the<br>
    professor's research is<br>
    irrefutable.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (her doubt's growing)<br>
    I... I don't know anymore...</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    Then step aside...</p>
  <p> He grabs the shovel from Vash.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He throws away the phaser rifle and lowers himself into<br>
    the hole. He begins digging frantically.</p>
  <p> SOVAK<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Uthat is here... somewhere...<br>
    Just waiting to be found... It<br>
    can't hide from me forever.</p>
  <p> He continues digging.</p>
  <p>44 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash watch this sorry spectacle for a beat<br>
    and then turn to leave.</p>
  <p>45 INT. LOBBY - EVENING</p>
  <p> It is nearly deserted.</p>
  <p>45A INT. VASH'S ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Vash ENTER. Vash looks like a tired and<br>
    defeated woman.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Five years of my life... wasted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There are other treasures to be<br>
    found, Vash.</p>
  <p> Vash nods. She is trying to put up a brave front, but<br>
    she is clearly devastated.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Not like the Uthat.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I hope you won't mind... but I<br>
    need to be alone for awhile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I quite understand.</p>
  <p> Vash manages a smile. She kisses Picard on the cheek<br>
    and he EXITS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>46 INT. PICARD'S ROOM - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Picard, back in the clothes he wore when he first came<br>
    to the Haven, is packing his travel bags. (NOTE: He<br>
    is now wearing his communicator.)</p>
  <p> RIKER (COM VOICE)<br>
    Enterprise to Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard keys his insignia.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> INTERCUT TO:</p>
  <p>47 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker at Command. Data and Worf at their usual<br>
    stations. Supernumerary (Bennett) at Conn.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope we're not interrupting<br>
    anything important, Captain. I<br>
    just wanted to inform you that<br>
    we have achieved orbit around Risa<br>
    and are ready to beam you up at<br>
    your convenience.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will be returning shortly,<br>
    Commander. In the interim, stand<br>
    ready to initiate Transporter Code<br>
    Fourteen at my signal.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts -- perhaps he misunderstood Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Code Fourteen?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You heard me, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/26/90 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>48 INT. LOBBY - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Deserted, except for Vash who is dressed as in the<br>
    teaser. She carries the back pack as she hurries<br>
    toward the Horga'hn Shrine.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Leaving so soon?</p>
  <p> A startled Vash whirls around to see:</p>
  <p>49 VASH'S P.O.V.</p>
  <p> On Picard who has been waiting in a secluded area for<br>
    just this moment.</p>
  <p>50 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> As Picard approaches, Vash manages to recover her<br>
    poise.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Jean-Luc -- I was just about to<br>
    come say good-bye.</p>
  <p> Picard plays it nonchalant, but he is carefully<br>
    scrutinizing her reactions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well then, I've saved you the<br>
    bother.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I want to put all this behind me<br>
    as soon as possible. You<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. However, there is one<br>
    last thing you can do for me.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Anything.</p>
  <p> Picard leans forward in a confidential manner.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Captain's Holiday&quot; - REV. 1/29/90 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Show me where you've hidden the<br>
    Tox Uthat.</p>
  <p> Vash stares back at him with a look of outraged<br>
    innocence.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    That's not funny, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> But Picard isn't interested in denials.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You never intended to burn that<br>
    second disc. If you had, you<br>
    wouldn't have been so careless<br>
    as to allow Sovak to salvage any<br>
    of it. You wanted him to follow<br>
    us so he could see for himself<br>
    that the Uthat wasn't at the cave<br>
    site. It was the only way to<br>
    convince him your quest had been<br>
    futile.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    But how could I have known the<br>
    Uthat wasn't there?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because you had gone there once<br>
    before. Probably the moment you<br>
    arrived on the planet. That's<br>
    when you found it.</p>
  <p> A long beat before Vash finally answers.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (a reluctant smile)<br>
    You're a man of many talents,<br>
    Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> She reaches over to the shrine and picks up one of the<br>
    smaller Horga'hns.</p>
  <p> She hands the figure over to Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Open it.</p>
  <p> Picard finds a hinge in the belly of the idol. He<br>
    lifts up the top half.</p>

  <p>52 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    (admiring it)<br>
    A piece of the future.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A very dangerous piece. Were you<br>
    really going to give it to the<br>
    Daystom Institute?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Well, maybe not give it.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    Five years is a huge investment,<br>
    Jean-Luc. I deserve to make a<br>
    reasonable profit.</p>
  <p>53 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> AJUR<br>
    Congratulations Picard. We knew<br>
    you would not fail us.</p>
  <p> Vash grabs hold of Picard's arm.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    You're not going to just hand<br>
    it over are you?<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You didn't trust me... what makes<br>
    you think you can trust them?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assume the Vorgons have proof<br>
    to back up their claims.</p>
  <p> Picard's words are clearly intended as much for the<br>
    Vorgons as for Vash.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    Our being here is proof enough.</p>
  <p> And as Vash makes the connection --</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Wait a second, Vorgons?<br>

  <p> VASH (Cont'd)<br>
    According to the professor's<br>
    notes, it was two Vorgons... a<br>
    male and a female... who tried<br>
    to steal the Uthat in the first<br>
    place. For all we know it could<br>
    be them.</p>

  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard confronts the Vorgons. His earlier suspicions<br>
    now seemingly confirmed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're going to have to prove<br>
    you are who you say you are.</p>
  <p> Both Vorgons make no move to comply.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    As you yourself said, the Uthat<br>
    belongs to the future.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But not necessarily to you.</p>
  <p> Boratus points a weapon at Picard.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    You will return what is ours,<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> Vash moves towards Boratus. The beam from the weapon<br>
    hits her in the chest, pushing her backwards.</p>
  <p> Picard moves quickly -- placing the Uthat on the floor<br>
    as he keys his communicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise... Code Fourteen...<br>
    Lock on present coordinates...<br>
    three second delay... Mark!</p>
  <p> Picard moves away from the Uthat as Ajur runs towards<br>

    turns his attention to the Vorgons.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Go. Return to your own time.<br>
    There's nothing for you here.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Somehow I doubt you'd find life<br>
    aboard a starship suitable to your<br>
    taste.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    Probably not. I could never<br>
    tolerate all that discipline.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are your plans?</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I thought I'd explore the ruins<br>
    on Sarthong Five. No telling what<br>
    I might find there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the Sarthongians deal harshly<br>

  <p> Picard closes up his bags. And she's right. He is<br>
    somewhat concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You will try and stay out of<br>
    trouble.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I always try.</p>
  <p> But they both know she's not going to try very hard.</p>
  <p> And now there's nothing left to do but say good-bye.<br>
    And it seems only natural for Picard to take her in<br>
    his arms for a farewell kiss. Afterward --</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    I wish we had more time together.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Perhaps we do.<br>
    (off her questioning<br>

    The Vorgons are time travelers.<br>
    Now that they know where and when<br>
    the Uthat can be found, they may<br>
    very well come back and try for<br>
    it again.</p>
  <p> VASH<br>
    So we may be doing this all over<br>
    again.</p>

  <p> VASH<br>
    Good-bye Jean-Luc.</p>

    Everything is exactly like it was in the first shot<br>
    of the Teaser.</p>
  <p>59 NEW ANGLE (RE-DO OF SCENE 2) (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before, the Vorgons MATERIALIZE by one of the<br>
    entranceways.</p>
  <p> The Vorgons glance curiously around the lobby then make<br>
    their way over to a nearby wall grid.</p>
  <p> Ajur places her palm on an adjoining sensor panel which<br>
    glows at her touch.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    Welcome to Risa. All that is ours<br>
    is yours.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    We are looking for the lodging<br>
    chamber of Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER (V.O.)<br>
    A file scan reveals no record of<br>
    a Captain Picard currently<br>
    visiting Risa.</p>
  <p> Boratus turns to Ajur.</p>
  <p> BORATUS<br>
    We're early.</p>
  <p> AJUR<br>
    Again.</p>
  <p> And their look implies that this time they are<br>
    determined to be successful.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
