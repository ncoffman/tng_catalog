  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Cruising at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43125.2.<br>
    We are en route to Mintaka Three,<br>
    where a three-man Federation<br>
    anthropological field team has<br>
    been studying the inhabitants.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD is flanked by RIKER and TROI. WORF and DATA<br>
    are at their stations; SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Our mission is to resupply the<br>
    outpost and repair their<br>
    malfunctioning reactor.</p>
  <p> TURBOLIFT DOORS OPEN and GEORDI ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've finished replicating the<br>
    parts they need.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    What I don't understand is why<br>
    a three-man station needs a<br>
    reactor that can produce<br>
    four-point-two gigawatts.</p>
  <p> Riker knows, but wants to see if Geordi can figure it<br>
    out for himself:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's enough to power a small<br>
    phaser bank, a subspace relay<br>
    station, or...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (putting it together)<br>
    ... a hologram generator. Right<br>
    -- a &quot;duck blind.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The anthropologists are studying<br>
    an extended family of Mintakans<br>
    at close range... from a<br>
    camouflaged observation post.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    According to Doctor Barron's<br>
    preliminary reports, the Mintakans<br>
    are proto-Vulcan humanoids at the<br>
    Bronze Age level. Quite peaceful<br>
    and highly rational.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Not surprising, considering how<br>
    closely their evolution has<br>
    paralleled Vulcan.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, incoming transmission<br>
    from Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> On the MAIN VIEWER appears the fuzzy image of BARRON,<br>
    intermittently broken up by LINES AND SWIRLS of STATIC<br>
    INTERFERENCE. Barron is a middle-aged human; he's in<br>
    a small cave-like room -- the &quot;DUCK BLIND&quot; -- which<br>
    is both scientific laboratory and living quarters for<br>
    the three members of the field team. One wall contains<br>
    ports looking out onto the planet.</p>
  <p> Behind Barron, two more scientists -- PALMER (a young<br>
    human male) and WARREN (an older human female) --<br>
    work on the malfunctioning reactor. Barron's mood<br>
    is calm, unhurried -- the situation is not desperate.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Barron to Enterprise. Our<br>
    temporary repairs have failed.<br>
    The reactor is now inoperative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/9/89 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have battery backup?</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Three hours' worth at best.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, if we increase to warp<br>
    seven we can be there in twenty-three<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.<br>
    (to Barron)<br>
    We're on our way --</p>
  <p> On the Main Viewer, an EXPLOSION rocks the outpost.<br>
    Haywire ELECTRICAL BOLTS cascade everywhere. A console<br>
    a few feet from the reactor SHORTS OUT. STATIC and<br>
    INTERFERENCE obscure the image.</p>
  <p> Barron and Warren are STRUCK by the BOLTS and knocked<br>
    unconscious. Palmer, also ZAPPED, covers his eyes,<br>
    temporarily blinded, and gropes randomly.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A hillside with sheer rock walls and outcroppings.<br>
    About three meters up a nearly sheer rockface is a<br>
    narrow path. A large section of the rockface above the<br>
    path SHIMMERS and FADES AWAY -- revealing the exterior<br>
    ported wall of the &quot;duck blind&quot; (the interior of which<br>
    is built inside the rockface). BLUE SPARKS dance<br>
    about the metal structure of the duck blind.</p>
  <p>3A INT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Palmer stumbles to a port, falls through it to the<br>
    outside --</p>
  <p>3B EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Palmer has fallen clear of the duck blind. Dazed and<br>
    disoriented, he makes his way down the path and EXITS<br>
    the area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard watches the Main Viewer helplessly as the image<br>
    from Mintaka -- with Barron lying on the floor --<br>
    BREAKS UP completely and DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We've lost contact, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Increase to warp nine.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> streaking to the rescue.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p>7 INT. DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, Geordi, BEVERLY, and A MEDIC MATERIALIZE<br>
    inside the duck blind. SPARKS and CORONA EFFECTS are<br>
    coursing through all metal parts of the structure.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi start working on the damaged reactor<br>
    while Data begins repairs on the shorted-out console.<br>
    Beverly and the medic tend to the injured Barron and<br>
    Warren.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - PATH - DAY</p>
  <p> Two Mintakans -- middle-aged LIKO and his teenaged<br>
    daughter OJI -- are walking. Mintakans look very<br>
    similar to Vulcans -- they have the same pointed ears<br>
    and arched eyebrows. Note: Though Mintakans are a<br>
    cool-headed, rational people, they are not as stoic and<br>
    emotionless as Vulcans.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Why did we have to come so early?</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    When the sun reaches its zenith,<br>
    I have to be ready to take the<br>
    measurements.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (amused)<br>
    You'll be ready. You've read<br>
    the sundial hundreds of times.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Yes, father -- but never as the<br>
    appointed recordkeeper.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You're taking your duties quite<br>
    seriously. Your mother would have<br>
    been proud of you.</p>
  <p>8A EXT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> Liko and Oji ENTER the area, which is presently<br>
    unoccupied. Outside the &quot;assembly hall&quot; is a large<br>
    bronze sundial/astrolabe. Oji steps up to the<br>
    astrolabe, takes a preliminary sighting. In doing so,<br>
    she notices something o.s.:</p>
  <p>9 REVERSE ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On a distant hillside, the exterior of the duck blind<br>
    is visible. Oji points it out to Liko:</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    What is that?</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I don't know...</p>
  <p> Curious, they quickly head off toward the hillside.</p>
  <p>10 INT. DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The medic works on Warren as Beverly tends to Barron,<br>
    who is semi-conscious.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    (delirious)<br>
    Keep work... Palmer... Warren...</p>
  <p> Beverly applies a hypo.</p>
  <p>10A ON RIKER AND GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still working on the reactor; Data is finishing up on<br>
    the console nearby.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/16/89 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>10A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The hologram generator is now<br>
    functional.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Or would be, if we had power...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost there...</p>
  <p>10AA EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Liko and Oji ENTER the area around the duck blind and<br>
    stop in amazement. Liko gestures for Oji to stay<br>
    hidden as he cautiously approaches the path leading to<br>
    the duck blind.</p>
  <p>10B WIDER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The medic working on Warren nods to Beverly -- ready.<br>
    Beverly taps her communicator:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Enterprise -- beam Martinez and<br>
    his patient directly to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Warren and the medic attending her DEMATERIALIZE. Data<br>
    looks up:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor --</p>
  <p> Beverly also looks up --</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE ON THE PORT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Peeking in one of the ports is Liko -- stunned at the<br>
    sight of these strangers magically disappearing.<br>
    Curious, Liko pokes his head further into the port, and<br>
    places a hand on the metal frame.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A furious ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE ZAPS Liko; dazed and<br>
    disoriented, he stumbles back.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Liko has fallen away from the duck blind. He slips<br>
    off the narrow path, falls three meters, and lands hard<br>
    on a section of jagged rock, severely gashing his head.<br>
    He GROANS.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON OJI</p>
  <p> Oji is at the bottom of the path. She's about to come<br>
    to her father's aid, but holds back as she sees:</p>
  <p>14 ON BEVERLY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly has already emerged from the duck blind and is<br>
    heading down the path to Liko's side.</p>
  <p>15 ANGLE ON LIKO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in intense pain. Beverly approaches, administers a<br>
    hypo. A moment later, Liko is out cold. Beverly<br>
    examines him, then touches her communicator:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Crusher to Enterprise. Medical<br>
    emergency. Two to beam directly<br>
    to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Liko DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>15A ANGLE ON OJI</p>
  <p> emerging from her hiding place and moving toward the<br>
    spot where her father disappeared.</p>
  <p>16 INT. DUCK BLIND - DAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi at the reactor. Geordi finishes up:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That should do it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi makes an adjustment. The reactor HUMS to life.</p>
  <p>17 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the camouflage unit kicks in, the duck blind<br>
    DISAPPEARS; the rockface is now, to all appearances,<br>
    solid rock.</p>
  <p>18 ANGLE ON OJI</p>
  <p> gazing bewildered at the wall of rock. She's<br>
    overwhelmed by the inexplicable wonders she has<br>
    witnessed.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>19 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Busy. MEDICAL PERSONNEL are performing surgery on Liko<br>
    and applying various forms of burn and anti-radiation<br>
    treatment to Warren and Barron.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves from one station to another, giving<br>
    orders. She crosses to Liko's biobed. The medic<br>
    is finishing up with Liko.</p>
  <p>20 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard ENTERS, crosses to Liko's biobed, and reacts<br>
    to the sight of a Mintakan aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    Picard glowers at Beverly, but before he can speak:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Before you start quoting the Prime<br>
    Directive -- he'd already seen<br>
    us; the damage was done. It was<br>
    bring him aboard or let him die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why didn't you let him die?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Because we were responsible for<br>
    his injuries!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know if I concur with<br>
    that reasoning, Doctor. But now<br>
    that he's here, you must remove<br>
    all memory of his encounter with<br>
    the away team.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    By erasing short-term recall?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's been accomplished before.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, I'm familiar with Doctor<br>
    Pulaski's technique.<br>
    (studies Liko)<br>
    Though I can't guarantee it will<br>
    be effective on Mintakan brain<br>
    chemistry --</p>
  <p> Beverly is interrupted by a COMMOTION O.S. --</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE ON BARRON</p>
  <p> Barron has regained consciousness, but he's half-delirious<br>
    and agitated. He struggles wildly with a<br>
    medic who's trying to restrain him:</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    No! We must evacuate --</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, and other medics run to Barron's<br>
    biobed and hold him back. Beverly zaps Barron with<br>
    a hypospray; Barron's struggles weaken.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (forceful)<br>
    Doctor Barron! You're on the<br>
    Enterprise. You're safe now.</p>
  <p> Barron gazes at her; reason slowly returns.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>22 ANGLE ON LIKO</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Liko's face -- after a beat, Liko's eyes open.</p>
  <p> BARRON (O.S.)<br>
    The others?</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Doctor Warren is here. We're<br>
    doing all we can.</p>
  <p> Liko, not daring to move a muscle, looks to the source<br>
    of the voices:</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE - WHAT LIKO SEES</p>
  <p> Medical personnel, Beverly, and Picard are gathered<br>
    around Barron's biobed. Picard is the only one in a<br>
    red uniform; he stands out dramatically.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    And Palmer? Where is Palmer?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Still on Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Picard -- you have to find him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    He may be hurt --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Rest assured -- we will not leave<br>
    until we locate Palmer.</p>
  <p> Picard's strength and conviction mollify Barron.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Thank you, Picard.</p>
  <p> Beverly helps Barron lie back and relax. Picard moves<br>
    away from the biobed, taps his communicator:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to bridge. Report.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Scans of the planet detect no<br>
    humans, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Take us into a close<br>
    orbit.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sir, a close orbit will<br>
    increase sensor efficiency by<br>
    only four percent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want that four percent,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard turns, finds himself looking at Liko -- who's<br>
    looking right back at him. Picard's speechless. After<br>
    a beat:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (tentative)<br>
    Picard?</p>
  <p> Liko's voice catches everyone's attention. Beverly<br>
    moves instantly to Liko's side, knocks Liko out with a<br>
    hypospray.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Damn --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, your next task is clear.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods as she looks at her troublesome patient:</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p>26 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY</p>
  <p> Oji is atop a bluff, finishing her reconnaissance. No<br>
    luck. She returns to the duck blind rockface, touches<br>
    it once more. Nothing happens. The hologram<br>
    generator's doing its job; the rockface looks and feels<br>
    authentic.</p>
  <p>27 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In a location not visible from the duck blind area, the<br>
    sleeping body of Liko MATERIALIZES. Slowly, Liko<br>
    awakens.</p>
  <p>28 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY</p>

  <p> Startled, Oji turns, looks about, tries to place which<br>

  <p> OJI<br>
    Father?</p>
  <p>29 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY</p>
  <p> as Liko sits up, examines himself.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Here...</p>
  <p> After a beat, Oji ENTERS, rushes to her father's side<br>
    -- and is amazed to see that her father's wounds have<br>
    disappeared.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    I thought I'd never see you again.<br>
    When you and the woman vanished,<br>
    I was sure you were dead.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I think I was... but I was brought<br>
    back to life. I awoke in an<br>
    incredible place -- and my wounds<br>
    were gone. I had been healed.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    How is that possible?</p>
  <p> Liko ponders this gravely.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Long ago, our people believed in<br>
    beings with great powers. These<br>
    beings made the rains come, told<br>
    the sun when to rise, and caused<br>
    all life to be born, to grow,<br>
    to die.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    But those are just tales -- old<br>
    superstitions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Perhaps the beliefs of our<br>
    ancestors are true. Nothing else<br>
    can explain what's happened.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Everything's changed now, Oji.<br>
    We must tell the others...</p>
  <p> On Liko's resolute expression, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>30 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Data, and Beverly. Beverly is<br>
    in mid-report.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    ... Barron is stable, but Warren<br>
    is still critical.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Palmer is missing, and scans of<br>
    the planet pick up Mintakan life<br>
    forms only -- no humans.<br>
    However...</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The area around the duck blind<br>
    exhibits Karst topography --<br>
    sinkholes, underground rivers,<br>
    and caverns. And the rock strata<br>
    contain a high concentration of<br>
    thallium compounds, which may be<br>
    obstructing our sensor beams.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So if Palmer, in his delirium,<br>
    fled into a cave, we might be<br>
    unable to detect his life signs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, if he is still alive,<br>
    he probably needs medical<br>
    attention. We must send an away<br>
    team to locate him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But our presence mustn't interfere<br>
    with the cultural development of<br>
    the Mintakans.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Further contamination<br>
    must be prevented.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/9/89 - ACT TWO 16.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir, I have a suggestion.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>31 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Orbiting Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First officer's log, Stardate<br>
    43125.3. Counselor Troi and I<br>
    are beaming down to Mintaka Three<br>
    to locate Doctor Palmer and<br>
    determine the extent of the<br>
    cultural contamination.</p>
  <p>32 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - SECLUDED AREA - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The same spot where Liko was beamed down. Riker and<br>
    Troi MATERIALIZE, along with two bundles of woven<br>
    cloth.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi have been made up as Mintakans,<br>
    complete with angled eyebrows and pointed ears.<br>
    They're wearing typical Mintakan garb: austere,<br>
    mannerly outfits of woven cloth.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Doctor Crusher has temporarily<br>
    altered our features and skin<br>
    color. She's also implanted<br>
    subcutaneous communicators so that<br>
    any transmissions we receive will<br>
    be inaudible to the Mintakans.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi look around. No one's in sight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise -- do you<br>
    read?</p>
  <p> Riker hears Data's com voice via direct bone<br>
    conduction, so it sounds unusually thin and faint:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    (filtered)<br>
    Perfectly, Commander. I will be<br>
    monitoring you continuously.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi pick up their bundles of woven cloth.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mintakan emotions are quite<br>
    interesting. Like the Vulcans,<br>
    they have highly ordered minds...<br>
    A very sensible people.</p>
  <p> They start to walk. Riker automatically takes the<br>
    lead. Troi stops him, moves in front of him. MOVE<br>
    with them as they walk.</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    (enjoying this)<br>
    For example, Mintakan women<br>
    precede their mates. It's a<br>
    signal to other women.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;This man's taken; get your own?&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not precisely... More like, &quot;if<br>
    you want his services, I'm the<br>
    one to negotiate with.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What kinds of &quot;services?&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    All kinds.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Ah. They are a sensible race.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi come around a rock formation and find<br>
    themselves on a path leading to the assembly hall area.</p>
  <p>32A EXT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> A few MINTAKANS are entering the area. Riker and Troi<br>
    ENTER and follow the Mintakans toward the assembly<br>
    hall.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/9/89 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>33 INT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> Assorted MINTAKANS are gathered around Liko and Oji.<br>
    This is the &quot;town hall&quot; where Mintakans meet daily --<br>
    both to barter and to talk, philosophize, exchange<br>
    information, and debate ideas.</p>
  <p> Among the listeners is NURIA, an attractive, middle-aged<br>
    Mintakan woman who's the leader of this community;<br>
    the Mintakans respect her calm, clear-headed<br>
    intelligence and give extra weight to her opinions.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Next to Liko and Oji is FENTO, an elderly Mintakan man<br>
    who's the community's &quot;storyteller&quot; -- its oral<br>
    historian.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I understand your skepticism.<br>
    Had it not happened to me, I would<br>
    find it difficult to accept as<br>
    well.</p>
  <p>34 ANGLE ON RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> as they enter the assembly hall.</p>
  <p> OJI (O.S.)<br>

    told you.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi stay on the outskirts of the group.</p>
  <p>35 WIDER</p>
  <p> as Liko turns to a skeptical Fento.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Fento -- you know the legends<br>
    better than anyone. Don't they<br>
    speak of beings like the ones I've<br>
    seen --</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    -- who could vanish like smoke?</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    There are the stories of the<br>
    Overseer... who could appear and<br>
    disappear at will...</p>
  <p> To Liko, this is confirmation. Fento's tone, however,<br>
    indicates that though he's aware of the legend, he<br>
    doesn't believe it.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    And couldn't this Overseer heal<br>
    the dead?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/14/89 - ACT TWO 18A.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    (nods)<br>
    He had supreme power -- or so our<br>
    ancestors believed.</p>
  <p> Liko nods. That's more confirmation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/18/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I believe I've seen the<br>
    Overseer...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    Uh-oh...</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    He is called the Picard.</p>
  <p> MURMURS from the Mintakans. This is heady stuff.<br>
    Riker and Troi exchange an &quot;oh, hell... &quot; glance and<br>
    speak in low tones:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    His memory is intact.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The procedure didn't work.</p>
  <p>36 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Nuria steps forward.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Liko -- all this talk of a<br>
    supernatural being... No one's<br>
    believed that for countless<br>
    generations. Just as we no longer<br>
    believe the stars control our<br>
    fates, or that the spirits of the<br>
    dead haunt the living.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I'm not saying all the old beliefs<br>
    are true. But I did see the<br>
    Picard, and I was restored to<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> More MURMURS from the Mintakans.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    We are visitors; we've come to<br>
    trade our cloth. May we speak?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Please do -- we welcome outsiders.<br>
    I am Nuria.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I am Troi; this is Riker.<br>
    (to Liko)<br>
    You've had a very interesting<br>
    dream.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (scoffs)<br>
    Dream? It was real!</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    My father and I both witnessed<br>
    these beings.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If you are father and daughter,<br>
    you may have shared the same<br>
    dream.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    That is not reasonable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is it any less reasonable than<br>
    being magically propelled to a<br>
    strange place by &quot;the Picard?&quot;</p>
  <p> The Mintakans exchange looks. Riker makes a good<br>
    point. Then:</p>

    elaborately-designed crossbows) come into view at the<br>
    entrance to the assembly hall -- carrying a bedraggled<br>
    and unconscious Palmer.</p>
  <p> Surprised reactions from the Mintakans. Liko and Oji<br>
    are triumphant.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    It has to be -- Palmer -- the one<br>
    the Picard wished to find.</p>
  <p> The Mintakans rush as one to gather around Palmer, peer<br>
    at him, touch his skin and clothing. They're not<br>
    aggressive -- merely curious about the stranger.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    (examining Picard)<br>
    Remarkable. You were speaking<br>
    the truth.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    The Picard will be pleased.</p>

  <p> BARRON<br>
    Picard -- you must beam Palmer<br>
    aboard immediately. Without<br>
    medical attention --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not that simple. He's<br>
    surrounded by Mintakans. If he<br>
    dematerializes before their<br>
    eyes...</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    ... it will slightly increase the<br>
    cultural contamination which<br>
    already exists. A small price<br>
    for saving Palmer's life.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks it over, addresses the com panel:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One -- is there any chance<br>
    of your freeing Palmer and<br>
    transporting up unseen?</p>
  <p>49 INTERCUTS - SICKBAY AND MINTAKA THREE</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi, still out of earshot of the Mintakans,<br>

  <p> BARRON<br>
    Picard, I must protest. You're<br>
    endangering Palmer with this<br>
    delay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of that. But each of<br>
    us -- including Doctor Palmer --<br>
    took an oath to uphold the Prime<br>
    Directive... if necessary, with<br>
    our lives.</p>
  <p>51 INT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY</p>
  <p> Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, Fento, and the other Mintakans<br>
    are still gazing at the unconscious Palmer. Riker<br>
    stands nearby; Troi is not present. Hali explains:</p>
  <p> HALI<br>
    We followed a hornbuck into a<br>
    cave. The stranger was there --<br>
    asleep.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    This Palmer is one of the<br>
    Overseer's servants?</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Yes -- the Picard has many<br>
    servants.<br>
    (to Fento)<br>
    Isn't that true?</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    (still skeptical)<br>
    According to the legends. But<br>
    if Palmer is a servant of the<br>
    Overseer, what was he doing in<br>
    the cave?</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Perhaps he ran away.</p>
  <p> HALI<br>
    Or he failed the Picard somehow<br>
    and was hiding from him.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    We should bind him in case he<br>
    wakes and tries to escape.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/21/89 - ACT THREE 27A.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's senseless to hold this<br>
    stranger captive. This Overseer<br>
    talk is nothing more than an old<br>
    superstition.</p>
  <p> Fento nods agreement.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    I disagree. All the evidence<br>
    suggests the Overseer does exist.</p>

  <p> LIKO<br>
    And I heard the Picard say he<br>
    wanted to find Palmer.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Then by keeping Palmer safe, we<br>
    will please the Picard.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    And he'll grant us favors in return.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Favors?</p>
  <p> Nuria raises an eyebrow, looks to Fento for<br>
    elaboration. Fento shrugs:</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    The Overseer was said to be<br>
    all-powerful. He could provide<br>
    gentle winters, plentiful hunting,<br>
    fertile crops... anything.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (quiet intensity)<br>
    He could even bring back those<br>
    who have died.</p>
  <p> Oji looks at Liko as Liko's meaning dawns. Is it<br>
    possible... ? Liko smiles warmly back at Oji: yes, it<br>
    is. The Mintakans look to Nuria, who reaches a<br>
    decision:</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    We will keep Palmer for the<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> A BUZZ of approval from the Mintakans -- good decision.</p>

    The Mintakans wish to please the<br>

    what he wants. They need a sign.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you suggesting...</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    (nods)<br>
    You must go down to Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Masquerading as a god?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Out of the question. The Prime<br>
    Directive --</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Has already been violated. The<br>
    damage is done; all we can do now<br>
    is minimize it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By sanctioning their false<br>
    beliefs?</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    By giving them guidelines...<br>
    letting them know what the<br>
    Overseer expects of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I cannot -- I will not impose a<br>
    set of commandments on these<br>
    people. To do so violates the<br>
    essence of the Prime Directive.</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    Like it or not, we've rekindled<br>
    the Mintakans' belief in the<br>
    Overseer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nuria -- your people live in huts.<br>
    Was it always so?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    No. We have found remnants of<br>

    must have lived there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do you now live in huts?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Huts are better. Caves are dark<br>
    and wet --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If huts are better, why did your<br>
    people ever live in caves?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    The most reasonable explanation<br>
    is that at one time we didn't know<br>
    how to make huts.</p>

  <p> Nuria mulls it over. Makes sense. She nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>

    I do not fear you any longer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. My people once lived in<br>

    huts... and, later, to build ships<br>

    Please -- if there is anything<br>
    I can do to change your mind...</p>
  <p>86 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> A sobering realization.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (almost to himself)<br>
    I've failed to get through to you,<br>
    haven't I? Despite all my<br>
    efforts...</p>
  <p> Nuria looks at Picard, her expression pleading for him<br>
    to do her people this simple favor. And all Picard can<br>
    do is look helplessly back at her...</p>
  <p>87 INT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Oji and Fento ENTER, rush up to a desperate Liko as<br>
    LIGHTNING CRACKLES outside.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Nuria can't be found. No one<br>
    knows where she's gone.</p>
  <p> Hali and the Mintakan hunter ENTER, out of breath.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Hali! Any sign of Palmer or<br>
    Riker?</p>
  <p> HALI<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    They've escaped us. We searched<br>
    everywhere.</p>
  <p> The LOUDEST THUNDER CRASH; this time, directly<br>
    overhead.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    What do we do now?</p>
  <p> After a moment of indecision:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    As the Picard wishes. Punish<br>
    those responsible.</p>
  <p> Liko holds out his hand to Hali -- &quot;give me your<br>
    crossbow.&quot; The Mintakans are astonished.</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    Nuria would not allow --</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Nuria isn't here -- and we can't<br>
    wait.</p>
  <p> More ear-splitting THUNDER. Hali looks from Liko to<br>
    the others, reluctantly makes up his mind, hands his<br>
    crossbow to Liko. Liko marches off toward the captive<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p>88 CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> watching impassively as Liko strides purposefully<br>
    toward her, crossbow in hand...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>89<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    90</p>
  <p>91 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Warren has started to spasm. A medic is at Warren's<br>
    side. Barron looks on helplessly. Beverly ENTERS,<br>
    tapping her communicator as she crosses --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Crusher to Picard. I think<br>
    we're going to lose Warren.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> Warren's spasms worsen. Beverly looks at the<br>
    monitor. Not good. The medic has a hypo ready;<br>
    Beverly glances at it, shakes her head.</p>
  <p> A massive convulsion shakes Warren's body. The vital<br>
    signs are dropping. Beverly and the medic can do<br>
    little more than wipe the sweat from Warren's brow and<br>
    keep Warren restrained. It's any doctor's nightmare<br>
    -- being forced to watch from the sidelines as the<br>
    patient fights the final battle.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. Nuria is right behind him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/21/89 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>92 ON WARREN</p>
  <p> Another spasm. Her eyes open. She tries to speak,<br>
    but hasn't the strength. Beverly motions for Barron<br>
    to stand near so Warren can see him. Warren can barely<br>
    focus -- but she recognizes Barron, tries to take his<br>
    hand. Barron clasps her tiny, frail hand and holds<br>
    on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/10/89 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARRON<br>
    I'm here, Mary.</p>
  <p> Beverly watches the vital signs. Almost nil.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Medic)<br>
    Prepare two cc's of norep.</p>
  <p> The medic readies a hypo. Warren is hit with a<br>
    seizure; her eyes close as a wave of pain racks her<br>
    body. Again she tries to speak -- nothing. With a<br>
    last effort of will, she forces her eyes open, looks up<br>
    at Barron --</p>
  <p> -- and then, mercifully, it's over; Warren goes limp;<br>
    her vital signs drop to zero. Beverly takes the hypo,<br>
    injects Warren's carotid artery, but it's futile and<br>
    she knows it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (cont'd)<br>
    (to Barron)<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Barron sits down, bows his head in grief.</p>
  <p>93 ON PICARD AND NURIA</p>
  <p> Picard lowers his head, grieves over their loss.<br>
    Nuria, profoundly moved, looks from Picard to Barron to<br>
    Beverly -- their remorse is palpable.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    Picard?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't respond.</p>
  <p> NURIA (cont'd)<br>
    You could not save her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    You do have limits. You are not<br>
    masters of life and death.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/21/89 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>93 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, we are not.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We can cure many diseases and<br>
    repair many injuries. We can<br>
    extend life... but despite all<br>
    our knowledge -- all our advances<br>
    -- we are just as mortal as you<br>
    are... just as powerless to<br>
    prevent the inevitable.</p>
  <p> Nuria gazes at Picard as if seeing him for the first<br>
    time -- empathizing with his remorse, his helplessness,<br>
    his humanity.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    You are a remarkable people. But<br>
    you are not superior beings.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    My people must be made to<br>
    understand that.</p>
  <p> Picard nods agreement.</p>
  <p>94 INT. MINTAKA THREE - ASSEMBLY HALL - NIGHT</p>
  <p> As before. The THUNDER continues. Liko steps up to<br>
    the captive Troi, followed by Oji, Fento, and Hali.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Liko -- you don't want to kill<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    I have no choice. I must do as<br>
    the Picard wishes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are you sure you know what he<br>
    wants?</p>
  <p> Liko is torn. No, he's not sure.</p>
  <p> TROI (cont'd)<br>
    (after a beat; to the<br>
    others)<br>
    That's one problem with believing<br>
    in a supernatural being... trying<br>
    to determine what he wants.</p>
  <p> A PEAL of THUNDER.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/21/89 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>94 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    We must do something.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    But what if we do the wrong thing?</p>
  <p>95 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Liko, agonized, picks up the crossbow and moves toward<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/10/89 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>95 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As the Mintakans part, clearing the way, Liko makes an<br>
    invocation:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Picard. We need your guidance.<br>
    Is it your wish that this woman<br>
    should die?<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Answer us! Speak!</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Liko!</p>
  <p> Everyone turns to see --</p>
  <p>96 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> ENTERING, accompanied by Nuria. Note: This is no grand<br>
    entrance of a god. Quite the opposite -- they simply<br>
    walk in the entrance.</p>
  <p>97 WIDER</p>
  <p> Liko sighs with relief.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    The Picard! The Overseer has<br>
    come!</p>
  <p> Picard steps up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Liko -- I am not the Overseer.<br>
    I am a man... a traveller from<br>
    a faraway land. Nothing more.</p>
  <p> Strange talk from a god. Liko's confused.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    But you restored my life! I am<br>
    your servant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are no one's servant. I<br>
    deserve neither your obedience<br>
    nor your worship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>97 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Why are you trying to deceive me?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Picard speaks the truth. I've<br>
    visited his people... I've seen<br>
    how they live... how they die.<br>
    When death takes their loved ones,<br>
    they are as helpless as we are.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Then how was I brought back to<br>
    life?</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    You were not dead. Picard's<br>
    people have knowledge we lack --<br>
    they can heal wounds that we<br>
    cannot.</p>
  <p> Liko whirls upon Picard.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    You can bring people back from<br>
    the dead. Show them, Picard.<br>
    You can bring my wife back to me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Why? Why won't you do this for<br>
    me? Have I failed you somehow?<br>
    Are you angry with me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am not angry.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Then I beg you -- bring her back<br>
    to life!</p>
  <p> Picard answers with silence.</p>
  <p> LIKO (cont'd)<br>
    I will give you my life in<br>
    exchange! Please -- take back<br>
    what you've given me -- and give<br>
    it to her! Let her live!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/10/89 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>97 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is beyond my power.</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    Nothing is beyond your power!<br>
    You are the Overseer -- I'll<br>
    prove it!</p>
  <p> Liko raises the crossbow, aims it at Picard. Nuria,<br>
    shocked, starts toward Liko --</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Liko!</p>
  <p>98 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he blocks Nuria with his arm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Liko. If I am<br>
    all-powerful, you can't hurt me.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    If, however, I am telling the<br>
    truth and I am mortal... you will<br>
    kill me.</p>
  <p> Picard lets that sink in.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    But if the only proof you will<br>
    believe is my life -- then shoot.</p>
  <p> Liko doesn't respond, keeps the crossbow aimed at<br>
    Picard's heart.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Don't do it, Liko!</p>
  <p> Picard remains unflinching.</p>
  <p>99 CLOSE ON LIKO</p>
  <p> A jumble of emotions -- anger, frustration, fear, and<br>
    doubt swirl in Liko's mind.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Father -- no!</p>
  <p> Oji grabs Liko's arm to stop him. The crossbow fires.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/16/89 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>100 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as the bolt strikes him in the shoulder -- hurling him<br>
    to the ground.</p>
  <p>101 WIDER</p>
  <p> as Nuria rushes to Picard's side. Picard writhes in<br>
    pain. Nuria touches his wound and holds up her bloody<br>
    hand for all to see.</p>
  <p> Liko drops his crossbow and steps up to Picard. Liko's<br>
    shock gives way to grief as he stares at the wounded<br>
    man lying in agony.</p>
  <p>102 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The Mintakans approach Picard with curiosity. The fear<br>
    and reverence are gone.</p>
  <p>102A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Orbiting Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    Before we dismantle the<br>
    observation post and depart, I<br>
    must make one last visit to<br>
    Mintaka Three.</p>
  <p>103 EXT. MINTAKA THREE - DUCK BLIND - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, wearing a sling on his arm, stands before the<br>
    rockface. (His wounded shoulder has been healed in<br>
    Sickbay.)</p>
  <p> Above and behind Picard is the (camouflaged) rockface.<br>
    Gathered are Nuria, Liko, Oji, Hali, Fento, and several<br>
    other Mintakans. One of the children hands Picard<br>
    some woven cloth. Picard nods his appreciation, then<br>
    taps his communicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> The rockface camouflage DISAPPEARS, REVEALING the duck<br>
    blind. The natives are surprised -- but not<br>
    overwhelmed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/10/89 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A place where we could watch your<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To study you. To understand your<br>
    ways.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    Why should a people so advanced<br>
    want to learn about us?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because we were once as you are.<br>
    To study you is to understand<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> FENTO<br>
    But why did you have to hide from<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> LIKO<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    Because their presence would<br>
    affect us... as it affected me.</p>
  <p> Picard is pleased that Liko has made this leap.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is our highest law that we<br>
    shall not interfere with other<br>
    cultures.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Then revealing yourselves was an<br>
    accident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. And now we must leave.</p>
  <p> OJI<br>
    Why? There's so much you could<br>
    teach us...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Who Watches... &quot; REV. 8/11/89 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    But that would also be<br>
    interfering. You must progress<br>
    on your own.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    As we will. You've shown us<br>
    that nothing is beyond our reach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not even the stars.</p>
  <p> NURIA<br>
    I wish you good journeys, Picard.<br>
    Remember my people.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Always.</p>
