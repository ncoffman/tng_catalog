    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise is entering a star system at impulse<br>
    speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43042.3.<br>
    We are cautiously entering the<br>
    Delta Rana star system three<br>
    days after receiving a distress<br>
    call from the Federation colony<br>
    on its ninth planet.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WORF, DATA and WESLEY are at their stations. PICARD<br>
    and RIKER have their eyes on the Main Viewer. BEVERLY<br>
    and TROI are present as advisors. The entire ship is<br>
    on alert, ready for anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    The garbled transmission reported<br>
    the colony under attack from an<br>
    unidentified spacecraft. Our<br>
    mission is one of rescue and --<br>
    if necessary -- confrontation with<br>
    a hostile force.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up, maximum strength.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields up.<br>
    (studying)<br>
    Sensors do not indicate the<br>
    presence of any armed space<br>
    vehicles operating in the Rana<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They could be cloaked or otherwise<br>
    shielded.<br>

  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Mister Crusher, bring us in well<br>
    clear of the planet's three moons.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, I am not receiving<br>
    Rana Four's call sign.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Open a frequency to Colony<br>
    Operations.</p>
  <p> Data does as told. The results are negative.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no response. Rana Four<br>
    is emissions quiet.</p>
  <p> Troi is also having trouble with her specialty.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, there are eleven thousand<br>
    inhabitants in the colony. At<br>
    this range I should be feeling<br>
    something.... I'm not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, put the planet<br>
    on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The planet of Rana IV slowly grows into being on the<br>
    Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> The screen magnifies. It is immediately obvious that<br>
    the planet has sustained catastrophic damage. The<br>
    crew of the Enterprise is mortified.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    My God...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Helm, put us in a high equatorial<br>
    orbit. Scan for survivors.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/4/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Survivors? Down there?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors are scanning ninety<br>
    degrees of longitude as we orbit.<br>
    I am detecting no artificial<br>
    structures, no vegetation, no<br>
    bodies of water...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Lifeform readings are negative.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Could the colonists have escaped?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is unlikely. Rana Four<br>
    possessed no interstellar<br>
    spacecraft.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who could cause devastation on<br>
    such a scale?</p>
  <p> Suddenly Wesley is calling out in great excitement --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hold it -- hold it! I'm getting<br>
    something at thirty-seven degrees<br>
    north, sixty-two degrees east --<br>
    a structure!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hopeful)<br>
    Life?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two lifeforms. Possibly human.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put the area on the Main Viewer<br>
    and magnify.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/2/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE - MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer shows an incredible sight: an extreme<br>
    aerial SHOT of a six square acre plot of unscathed<br>
    land; an incongruous patch of green surrounded by a sea<br>
    of devastation. The crew of the Enterprise is stunned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The structure is located at the<br>
    center of the vegetation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (disbelieving)<br>
    An entire planet obliterated...<br>
    except for a few acres of trees<br>
    and grass... and one building?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's some kind of illusion...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative. It is as you see it.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a beat to think about this. But he can't<br>
    explain it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, I think you had better<br>
    see who's home...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND RANA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise orbits Rana IV.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard with Troi and Beverly walk toward the<br>
    Transporter Room. He is consulting with them on the<br>
    two occupants of the structure on Rana IV.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If they're the only survivors<br>
    of a global holocaust, they can't<br>
    be in very good shape.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor... ?</p>
  <p> They pause at the entrance to the Transporter Room.<br>
    Troi is vague and uncomfortable with her reading.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What I sense of them is human...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And something else... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    It's difficult to explain... I<br>
    feel these two people are<br>
    somehow... different.<br>
    (apologetic)<br>
    I'm sorry. I cannot be any<br>
    clearer than that.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS the Transporter Room and joins them. Says<br>
    to Picard, indicating the room --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're ready.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/4/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data, Worf and GEORDI are in position on the pad.<br>
    Riker and Beverly join them. Picard and Troi observe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good luck, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Energize...</p>
  <p> The away team DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 EXT. RANA IV - ESTABLISHING SHOT - HOUSE - DAY<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The house, a typical twenty-fourth century colonial structure,<br>
    stands alone on its plot of trees and grass surrounded<br>
    on all sides by scorched earth. There is no sign of<br>
    life, inside or out.</p>
  <p>9 ANGLE ON FRONT OF HOUSE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the away team MATERIALIZES in the protection of a<br>
    grove of trees near the house's front door. Riker<br>
    wants an instant survey.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What can you tell me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The house is a typical settlement<br>
    structure with adaptations. Its<br>
    thermal properties all seem to<br>
    conform to known materials.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If there are indicators as to why<br>
    this particular area has remained<br>
    intact, I cannot detect them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, the interior of the house.</p>
  <p> Worf is already scanning it with his tricorder. (NOTE:<br>
    The interior of the house is dark.)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - 7/31/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    One individual is located at the<br>
    south end of the house, the other<br>
    toward the north. There is a<br>
    weapon -- a low-yield phaser,<br>
    nonfunctional -- in proximity to<br>
    the front-room individual.</p>
  <p> Riker considers all of this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess a frontal assault is<br>
    unwarranted. Stay here. I'm<br>
    going to try an old-fashioned<br>
    knock on the door.</p>
  <p>10 NEW ANGLE - RIKER</p>
  <p> Riker leaves the cover of the trees and moves toward<br>
    the house. Suddenly Geordi sees something --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander, there's a --</p>
  <p> Too late. Riker steps into a concealed snare that<br>
    hauls him up into a tree by one foot. The others leave<br>
    cover to help him. The noise and confusion is<br>
    considerable.</p>
  <p>11 ANGLE - FRONT DOOR OF HOUSE</p>
  <p> An elderly man, KEVIN UXBRIDGE, comes cautiously out<br>
    of the house, holding the phaser.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Who's there? Who are you people?</p>
  <p> The away team stops in its effort to get Riker down<br>
    and faces the threat. Riker, still hanging, has the<br>
    presence to respond.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander William Riker, USS<br>
    Enterprise, and crewmembers. May<br>
    I get down and approach you, sir?</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi go back to helping Riker.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    You leave him right where he is.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - 7/31/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander, shall I incapacitate<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.<br>
    (to Kevin)<br>
    We're a rescue party. We picked<br>
    up your colony's distress call<br>
    and came as fast as we could.</p>
  <p> Just then an elderly woman, RISHON UXBRIDGE, appears<br>
    at the front door. While Kevin is a naturally<br>
    suspicious person, she is naturally trustful. She is<br>
    thrilled to see the rescuers. She gently scolds Kevin.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Kevin, what are you doing? Can't<br>
    you see they're here to help us?<br>
    Can't you see they're human?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (to Rishon)<br>
    Stay in the house, Rishon. It<br>
    could be some kind of trick.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE - AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> As Rishon ignores Kevin and approaches the away team.<br>
    There are tears of joy in her eyes. Riker slips down<br>
    out of the tree.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    We'd just about given up hope.<br>
    We thought maybe the whole<br>
    Federation had been attacked.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Do you know of any other<br>
    survivors?</p>
  <p> Rishon looks at her with desperate eyes.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    It's been days since we've seen<br>
    or heard anybody else...<br>
    (off Beverly's look)<br>
    Please, no -- don't tell me we're<br>
    the only ones...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Kevin tries to comfort Rishon. He says to Riker in a<br>
    shaky tone of voice --</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    They came in a spaceship so big<br>
    you could see it up in orbit.<br>
    They took our world apart piece<br>
    by piece.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    We don't know. We never saw<br>
    their faces.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't know where they came<br>
    from -- where they are now?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I guess they've gone away.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes out her medical tricorder and scans the<br>
    couple. They react. Beverly is apologetic.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sorry. I'm only performing<br>
    a physical. Could I have your<br>
    names please -- for the record.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    I'm Rishon Uxbridge... and this<br>
    is my husband Kevin.</p>
  <p> Data joins them with --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Botanists. Originally from the<br>
    aquatic city New Martim Vaz in<br>
    the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.<br>
    Residents of the Rana Four<br>
    colony for five years.<br>
    (to Rishon; a smile)<br>
    You, ma'am, are eighty-two years<br>
    of age and a composer of<br>
    Tao-classical music.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    (to Kevin)<br>
    You, sir, are eighty-five years<br>
    of age and a specialist in<br>
    symbiotic plantlife. You have<br>
    been married fifty-three years.</p>
  <p> The couple stare at Data in amazement. So does the<br>
    rest of the away team. He explains --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I memorized the colony register<br>
    on the way to Rana in the event<br>
    such information was needed.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE - RIKER</p>
  <p> Riker moves away from the others to study the house<br>
    up close. Kevin leaves Rishon to follow him.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your house -- with your permission<br>
    I'd like to look inside.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Why? What could interest you<br>
    in there?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Uxbridge, as far as we've<br>
    been able to determine, you and<br>
    your wife -- and this house --<br>
    are all that survived the attack.<br>
    It was either a bizarre<br>
    coincidence or by design. I<br>
    don't favor the coincidence<br>
    theory.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Are you saying we were left alive<br>
    intentionally?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hesitant)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    I don't understand. You don't<br>
    think Rishon and I did something<br>
    to merit our survival, do you?<br>
    I mean, betrayed the others... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not accusing you of anything,<br>
    Mister Uxbridge. The attacking<br>
    force spared you for some reason.<br>
    We're only trying to find out why.<br>
    (indicates house)<br>
    May I look inside... ?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (numb; bewildered)<br>
    I said you could.</p>
  <p>14 INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM</p>
  <p> As Riker ENTERS. The interior is as normal as a twenty-<br>
    fourth century colonial interior can be. There are elements<br>
    of Rishon, elements of Kevin. Nothing to indicate that<br>
    they are bad people. The rest of the away team follows<br>
    Riker in. They spread out.</p>
  <p>15 ANGLE - RISHON AND KEVIN</p>
  <p> Rishon and Kevin ENTER the house. Rishon is determined<br>
    to make her rescuers welcome. She heads for the<br>
    kitchen with --</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    I'll make a cup of tea for<br>
    everyone. We have wonderful tea<br>
    on Rana. It grows wild nearly<br>
    everywhere...</p>
  <p> She suddenly realizes Rana IV and its tea are gone<br>
    forever; she can't finish. She hurries away to the<br>
    kitchen. Kevin watches her go. Worf approaches him<br>
    and makes an honest attempt to cheer him up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, may I say that your attempt<br>
    to hold our away team at bay with<br>
    a nonfunctioning weapon was an<br>
    act of unmitigated gall.</p>
  <p> Kevin looks at the phaser that he's still holding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/10/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Didn't fool you, huh?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (rare smile)<br>
    I admire gall.</p>
  <p> Geordi joins them. He too is interested in Kevin.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Excuse me. Out front -- that<br>
    was about the best job of<br>
    concealing a snare that I've ever<br>
    seen. Could you tell me what it<br>
    was for?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Got a local critter that's<br>
    developed a taste for what's in<br>
    the garden.<br>
    (sad realization)<br>
    Guess I should've dismantled it.<br>
    Guess I don't have to worry about<br>
    him anymore.</p>
  <p> He happens to look across the room and see --</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE - DATA</p>
  <p> Data has wandered to a small table where an ornate<br>
    MUSIC BOX sits. He studies the music box. Just then<br>
    Rishon emerges from the kitchen and moves toward a<br>
    cupboard where her tea service is stored. She sees<br>
    Data looking at the music box.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Go ahead. Pick it up. It's a<br>
    music box. It's been in my<br>
    family for generations.</p>
  <p>17 TIGHT ON MUSIC BOX</p>
  <p> Data carefully lifts the box. (NOTE: any convenient<br>
    waltz music will do for the music.) A few bars and we:</p>
  <p> SMASH CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>18 INT. ENTERPRISE - TROI'S QUARTERS - CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> Troi is going about her normal daily routine inside<br>
    her quarters. Suddenly she comes alert as if hearing<br>
    something. We realize she is hearing the music from<br>
    the music box in her head (although she doesn't know<br>
    this)! And it stays, playing over and over...</p>
  <p>19 BACK TO LIVING ROOM - RIKER AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly are consulting with each other near<br>
    the front door. Riker is at a lost to explain the<br>
    riddle of the house and Kevin and Rishon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've been in every room. There's<br>
    nothing unusual about this house<br>
    except that it's here. What about<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They're in reasonably good health.<br>
    Both show signs of mental stress.<br>
    Understandable considering what<br>
    they've been through.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (mystified)<br>
    But somehow they're different.</p>
  <p> Riker looks o.s. in the direction of Rishon (with<br>
    Data).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's get back to the ship. We'll<br>
    take them with us.</p>
  <p>20 ANGLE - RISHON AND DATA</p>
  <p> As the music in the music box runs down. Data smiles.<br>
    Just then, Riker interrupts them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Excuse, Mrs. Uxbridge. We have<br>
    to return to the ship now.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Commander, I haven't finished<br>
    fixing your tea --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry, but we're finished<br>
    here. We can give you and Kevin<br>
    time to pack. You can bring as<br>
    much as you want.</p>
  <p> Rishon gives him a look of astonishment. Kevin appears<br>
    at her side and give Riker the same look.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    What do you mean pack?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    You're not thinking of taking us<br>
    with you, are you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Surely you don't want to remain<br>
    here. How will you take care of<br>
    yourselves?</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    (to Kevin; frightened)<br>
    Kevin, I can't leave my home!<br>
    Don't let them do this to us.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    No one's going to make us leave.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'll be protected on the ship.<br>
    You could still be in danger on<br>
    Rana.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    Commander, we appreciate your<br>
    concern but we're not going<br>
    anywhere. We'll manage. We<br>
    always have.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a beat. These two people are beyond<br>
    his understanding. And he's concerned about them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right. I can't make you come<br>
    with us. Are you familiar with<br>
    one of these... ?</p>
  <p> Riker hands Rishon his communicator. She nods.</p>

    We'll remain in this system for<br>
    the next several days at least.<br>
    If you should reconsider, please<br>
    contact us.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    We'll be fine, Commander. We have<br>
    each other...</p>

  <p>22 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - FAVORING PICARD</p>
  <p> Picard is in the middle of debriefing Riker, Beverly,<br>
    Geordi and Data. Troi is there as a consultant -- but<br>
    she seems distant, lost in thought, troubled (because<br>
    the song is still playing in her mind). All are seated<br>
    at the table except Picard who paces with controlled<br>
    energy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are they collaborators? Did they<br>
    in fact provide their colony's<br>
    assailants with something that<br>
    abetted the total destruction of<br>
    Rana Four in order to protect<br>
    their own lives?</p>
  <p> Beverly is skeptical.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What could two botanists in their<br>
    eighties possess that could<br>
    possibly aid whoever attacked this<br>
    planet?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have no idea what the enemy<br>
    needed, Doctor. Love, fear, hope<br>
    -- a cup of tea. It is a strange<br>
    universe we live in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe they're being held hostage<br>
    in some fashion.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Nothing in the tricorder readings<br>
    indicated emotional stress.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> Picard gives her a quizzical look. Suddenly from Geordi<br>
    --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Specimens...<br>
    (off their looks)<br>
    Maybe they've been preserved as<br>
    specimens... pets... trophies...<br>
    exhibits in a zoo...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    No. The assailants would have<br>
    picked someone younger for that,<br>
    someone who would have given them<br>
    a proper show for their money.</p>

  <p> Picard looks at Riker --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Number One, you say the couple<br>
    is incapable of sustaining<br>
    themselves?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's a fusion reactor in the<br>
    house, probably good for another<br>
    five years of power. But their<br>
    watertable is tainted and they<br>
    have no way of feeding themselves<br>
    other than a small garden.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They won't come to the ship?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They were adamant.</p>
  <p> Picard considers all that he's heard for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll do all that we can to help<br>
    them... but in the meantime I want<br>
    them kept under surveillance.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Troi, looking pale and drawn, stands up to<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Counselor, is something wrong?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sorry... I don't feel well.<br>
    I would like to go to my<br>
    quarters...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By all means.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is there anything I can do?</p>
  <p> Troi shakes her head and leaves the room without<br>
    another word. Picard watches her go, concerned. The<br>
    others too.</p>

  <p>23 INT. CORRIDOR - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Picard walks alone, moving toward a turbolift. He is<br>
    intercepted by Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, a search of the Ranian<br>
    system has determined that the<br>
    hostile force that attacked this<br>
    planet is no longer present.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I remember a Starfleet admiral<br>
    saying the same thing about some<br>
    renegade Andorians in the<br>
    Triangulum system once. The truth<br>
    was they'd dismantled their ship<br>
    and hidden it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (chest out)<br>
    Those Andorians did not have to<br>
    contend with someone of my<br>
    thoroughness. I will stake my<br>
    reputation.</p>
  <p> Picard believes him. The turbolift arrives and Picard<br>
    steps in.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>24 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS - TROI</p>
  <p> Troi is on her bed, fully clothed, trying to sleep.<br>
    She looks strained, tired. From her actions we know<br>
    the song is still playing in her head. She tosses and<br>
    turns. Sleep is impossible. She sits on the bed and<br>
    rubs her face. She stands and paces. She puts her<br>
    hands over her ears as if the song could be stopped<br>
    that way. Nothing works. She talks to herself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't listen... think of something<br>
    else...</p>
  <p> Nothing works. She sits in a chair and pulls at her<br>
    hair. She stands again.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Stop... please stop!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>

  <p> Suddenly there is a soft knock (chimes?) at her door.<br>
    She jumps at the sound. Collects herself --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Yes --</p>
  <p>25 INCLUDE PICARD</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS the room. He sees Troi's condition and<br>
    knows something must be wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was concerned. I came to see<br>
    if I could be of any help.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm fine. There's nothing wrong.<br>
    I'm tired, that's all.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't believe her. He goes up to her for a<br>
    closer look. She shies away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't have your gift for reading<br>
    emotions, Counselor, but I can<br>
    tell when someone is in pain and<br>
    hiding it.</p>
  <p> Troi starts to lie to him again, then decides to tell<br>
    the truth.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's silly... I... I hear music.<br>
    Music that won't stop. In my<br>
    mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinks he understands)<br>
    Perhaps it's a symptom of<br>
    fatigue. We've all been inflicted<br>
    one time or another with the song<br>
    that wouldn't quit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... it's deeper than that. The<br>
    song never stops for an instant.<br>
    It plays in perfect clarity from<br>
    beginning to end over and over<br>
    again.<br>

    I can't explain. They're elusive.<br>
    They're... I'm sorry...</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't want to push her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get some rest. Take the necessary<br>
    sleep inducements if you have to.</p>
  <p> Troi gives him a weak nod. She'll try... but she isn't<br>

    It's assuming an attack posture.<br>
    Don't be surprised if --</p>
  <p> Riker doesn't have the chance to finish &quot;if it fires on<br>
    us&quot; because that's exactly what the warship does,<br>
    unleashing a wave of matter/anti-matter that strikes<br>
    the outer shields and shakes the Enterprise -- but<br>
    without causing any damage.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The vessel is firing jacketed<br>
    streams of positrons and<br>
    antiprotons, equivalent firepower<br>

    It's getting louder! So loud...<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> Troi settles down enough to allow the assistants to put<br>
    her down on the bed. Beverly takes out her medical<br>
    hypo and attempts to administer a sedative. Troi<br>
    shakes her head at the sight of the hypo.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This will relax you.</p>
  <p> Beverly injects her. Troi never relaxes for a second.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I hear it! It's still there!<br>
    It's so loud --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to assistants)<br>
    Move her to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts with fright at this idea.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No! I want to stay in my<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can get you to sleep there.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't want to sleep! The music<br>

  <p>42 INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf are having tea with the Uxbridges.<br>
    Kevin is silent, moody, wishing they were gone. Rishon<br>
    is radiant, full of energy and love of life. Worf<br>
    looks uncomfortable, out of place.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - 7/31/89 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is relaxed, taking it all in. Rishon is in the<br>
    middle of a story.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Kevin and I first saw each other<br>
    on a ship at sea. He was a<br>
    starving student in a threadbare<br>
    suit and mismatched shoes. I was<br>
    traveling with my parents who<br>
    didn't like the way he was hanging<br>
    around. I asked him to marry me<br>
    two hours after we met and he knew<br>
    I was serious. I don't think he's<br>
    ever recovered from that day.</p>
  <p> Rishon and Kevin exchange an intimate smile. Rishon<br>
    looks at Worf who is cautiously sampling his tea.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Mister Worf, what do you think?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (trying hard)<br>
    Good tea. Nice house.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Rishon)<br>
    Why did you leave Earth and move<br>
    to a brand new world when you did?</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    You mean at our age? We thought<br>
    it would make us fall in love all<br>
    over again.<br>
    (looks at Kevin)<br>
    It worked.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a sip of tea. It's time to get at the<br>
    heart of the matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It must've been terrible... when<br>
    the colony was fighting for its<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> Kevin looks away. Rishon is in complete agreement with<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/3/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Yes, it was. Fire lit the sky...<br>
    the ground never stopped<br>
    shaking... there was thunder,<br>
    unbelievable thunder...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you survived...</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    We don't know why we did and the<br>
    others didn't. I've tried to put<br>
    some purpose to it, but I can't.</p>
  <p> Kevin decides it's time to push Picard a little.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    I was wondering, Captain, when<br>
    you and your ship would be<br>
    leaving...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't have an answer for that.<br>
    A few hours ago we had an<br>
    encounter with a warship...<br>
    Possibly the one which attacked<br>
    you. We forced it to leave the<br>
    system but were unable to affect<br>
    it otherwise. It could return.</p>
  <p> Rishon reacts with fear. She turns to Kevin --</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Kevin -- you said it'd gone away.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    I guess I was wrong. Don't worry.<br>
    It didn't hurt us before, it won't<br>
    hurt us now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (fully alert)<br>
    Do you know that for a fact,<br>
    Kevin?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    No. But I don't enjoy seeing my<br>
    wife frightened. As we've told<br>
    you time and time again, Captain,<br>
    we don't know why we were spared.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Survivors&quot; - REV. 8/2/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But there had to have been a<br>
    reason. In some way you and<br>
    Rishon were &quot;different&quot; from the<br>
    other colonists. Your<br>
    geographical location, your<br>
    philosophical beliefs, the color<br>
    of your eyes -- somehow you stood<br>
    apart from them.</p>
  <p> Now it's Rishon's turn to look away. Kevin, with some<br>
    difficulty, tries to explain.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    There was a difference... I am<br>
    a man of special conscience.<br>
    While the others were doing what<br>
    they could, I chose not to fight.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. He may not agree with Kevin's views but<br>
    he accepts them as they are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is your protected right.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    But I assure you the attacking<br>
    ship had no way of realizing this.<br>
    I expected to die like all the<br>
    others.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to Kevin's unconscious choice of words.<br>
    Kevin, uncomfortable with what he has just said, stands<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's no reason for you and your<br>
    ship to remain, Captain. We can<br>
    manage without you.</p>
  <p> Kevin leaves the room. Rishon is distraught.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Kevin grieved for the others but<br>
    he did nothing. He's a very<br>
    gentle man. Please understand<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> From Picard's expression he doesn't understand.</p>

  <p>42 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about you, Rishon? Did you<br>
    feel the same way?</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    (difficult)<br>
    I wanted to fight... but I stayed<br>
    with my husband. Thank you again<br>
    for the replicator, Captain. I<br>
    had better clean up now...</p>
  <p> Picard gets the message. He and Worf stand to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Before we go I ask you one more<br>
    time to come to the ship. For<br>
    your own safety.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    I'm frightened, Captain. But I<br>
    can't leave Rana. Even if it<br>
    means my life.</p>

    treatment.) Troi is on her bed, sleeping; but it is<br>
    not a peaceful sleep. From the way her lips move and<br>
    from her tortured expression we know the song is still<br>
    playing in her mind.</p>
  <p> Beverly is watching, deeply distressed and mystified.<br>
    She says to one of her medical assistants --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't understand it. I've<br>
    inhibited almost all the activity<br>
    of the neocortex and she<br>
    continues to behave as if she's<br>
    hearing the music...<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We're going to have to shield<br>
    her from all outside stimuli by<br>
    inducing coma...</p>
  <p> The assistant goes through the procedure. Beverly<br>
    watches Troi as she slips into coma. There is still<br>
    a slight indication of continuing anguish on Troi's<br>
    face. Beverly is at a loss as to what to do next.</p>

    spaceship?</p>
  <p> Rishon avoids Picard's look... supports her husband.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    (a mumble)<br>
    I think you'd better go,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come to the Enterprise, Rishon.<br>
    Let me take you where you'll be<br>
    safe.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    No. I can't leave Kevin...</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    And I'm staying. She's safe here<br>
    with me in this house.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (at Kevin)<br>
    Then explain to me why you're<br>
    safe, Kevin. Why is this house<br>
    a sanctuary from a destructive<br>
    force that otherwise has no<br>
    conscience? Does it have to do<br>
    with you -- with your refusal to<br>
    fight?</p>

    from the others. Picard speaks to the back of his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Tell me this, Kevin. If Rishon<br>
    were in danger, would you kill<br>
    to save her life?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (vehement)<br>
    No! Not for her, not for anyone!<br>
    I will not kill!</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    (angry at Picard)<br>
    Stop hurting him! Leave our<br>
    house!</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers them both. Rishon is<br>
    comforting Kevin, protecting him. Picard repeats his<br>
    reason for coming --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is my sworn duty to protect<br>
    you. The Enterprise will remain<br>
    in orbit around Rana Four as<br>
    long as the two of you are alive.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    The pleasure is mine, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've been observing the planet<br>
    very carefully for three hours.<br>
    We've seen nothing. I have the<br>
    feeling you're waiting for<br>
    something to happen.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. He realizes it's time to tell Riker all<br>

    Worf, do you see survivors?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I detect two life-forms inside the<br>
    house. It appears Kevin and<br>
    Rishon were not destroyed. But<br>
    how... ?</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Riker. Riker's look of acknowledgement<br>
    indicates that Picard has told him all he suspects.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Helm, bring us into transporter<br>

    Picard addresses them with strained politeness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My apologies if I interrupted a<br>
    waltz...</p>
  <p> Kevin hangs back timidly. It is Rishon who is the<br>

  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Why have you brought us here<br>
    against our will?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To end the suffering of one of<br>
    my crewmembers.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    I don't understand --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Kevin does. He's the cause.</p>
  <p> Kevin avoids Rishon's look, says nothing, implying some<br>
    sort of guilt. Picard centers on Kevin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At first I couldn't figure out<br>
    why your house had survived the<br>
    holocaust while all the others<br>
    hadn't. And then it occurred<br>
    to me that it had been destroyed.<br>
    The dwelling where you served me<br>
    tea and danced your waltzes was<br>
    a reproduction, something real<br>
    to the touch but capable of being<br>
    created and destroyed and<br>
    recreated at whim.</p>
  <p> Rishon sees that Kevin is crumbling. Her desire to<br>
    protect him is strong. She doesn't believe anything<br>
    Picard has said and lashes back at him verbally --</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    Now you're joking with us,<br>
    Captain. Can't you see it's<br>
    hurting my husband?</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    (suddenly;<br>
    fatalistically)<br>
    Rishon... hear what he has to say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    More than anything, you wanted<br>
    the Enterprise away from Rana.<br>
    Why?<br>

  <p>71 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    Because the house, the plot of<br>
    land, your very own existence,<br>
    were riddles you were helpless<br>
    to explain. The warship --<br>
    another recreation -- twice tried<br>
    to chase us away but failed.<br>
    When I came to the house a second<br>
    time I provided you with the only<br>
    condition that would make the<br>
    Enterprise leave -- your deaths<br>
    -- and you did your best to<br>
    satisfy me.</p>
  <p> Rishon looks at Kevin, quizzically. He avoids her;<br>
    looks deeply at Picard.</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    I am deeply sorry about the<br>
    woman. I will help her. But<br>
    I must know what you intend to<br>
    do with me afterwards...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take you to the nearest starbase<br>
    where you will be held accountable<br>
    for the attack on this ship...<br>
    and perhaps the deaths of eleven<br>
    thousand people.</p>
  <p> RISHON<br>
    No! He hasn't killed anyone!</p>
  <p> KEVIN<br>
    The destruction of the planet<br>
    happened just as I told you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you haven't told us the whole<br>
    story, Kevin -- how it ended...<br>
    the part about Rishon.</p>
  <p> Kevin reacts as if in pain. Rishon's concern for him<br>
    is outweighed by her sudden need for answers.</p>
  <p> RISON<br>
    What is he saying... ?</p>
  <p> Kevin can't answer her. He turns away. Picard goes to<br>
    Rishon. Touches her.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can touch you, Rishon. Hear<br>
    your voice. Smell your perfume.<br>
    In every respect you are a real<br>
    person with your own mind and your<br>
    own beliefs... but you do not<br>
    exist. You died with the others,<br>
    defending the colony. He has<br>
    recreated you just as he has<br>
    recreated the house.</p>
  <p> There is a look of disbelief on Rishon's face... even<br>
    as she vanishes from sight. The bridge crew is<br>
    stunned. Kevin just stands there, expressionless,<br>
    frozen in time. Picard turns to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're the only living thing that<br>

    Kevin. And though you look<br>
    human, you're not.</p>
  <p>72 ANGLE - LIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Suddenly the bridge is filled with a brilliant, burning<br>
    LIGHT coming from no particular source. The light<br>
    grows to such intensity that all those present must<br>
    turn away and cover their eyes. There is confusion,<br>
    shouting. And then the light is gone as suddenly as it<br>
    came... and so is Kevin.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's in the turbolift!</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- he is dangerous!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So dangerous, Lieutenant, he could<br>
    have destroyed us at any instant<br>

    You had the power to stop them<br>

    I tried to fool you, but it only<br>
    made them angrier and more cruel.</p>

    No. You don't understand the<br>

    are sympathetic... and appalled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are not qualified to be your<br>
    judges. We have no law to fit<br>
    your crime. You're free to return<br>
    to the planet... and to make<br>
    Rishon live again.</p>
  <p>76A ANGLE - LIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Kevin and Picard exchange a long look. Kevin nods<br>
    to Picard. The room suddenly fills with the blinding<br>
    LIGHT (similar to what happened on the bridge). When<br>
    it is gone, so is Kevin.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>77 OMITTED</p>
  <p>78 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Our bridge regulars are present including Geordi, Troi<br>
    (looking well) and Beverly. They all want a last look<br>
    at the planet. Its scarred and ruined face is on the<br>
    Main Viewer.</p>

  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Helm... break orbit. Full<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p> Rana IV immediately begins to shrink as the<br>
    Enterprise pulls away. Picard can't take his eyes off<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43043.5.<br>
    We are departing the Rana<br>
    system for Starbase<br>
    one three three. We leave behind<br>
    a being of extraordinary power...<br>
    and conscience. I am not certain<br>
    if he should be praised or<br>
    condemned. Only that he should<br>
    be left alone...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
