    &quot;Deja Q&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship orbits Bre'el, a small, verdant planet orbited<br>
    by a single moon, irregularly shaped.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43539.1.<br>
    We have moved into orbit around<br>
    Bre'el Four to investigate a<br>
    potentially catastrophic threat<br>
    to the population from a<br>
    descending asteroidal moon...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI and RIKER in the<br>
    Command Chairs. DATA and WORF at their stations.<br>
    SUPERNUMERARY at Conn. On the Main Viewer is DOCTOR<br>
    GARIN, a middle-aged man. He is obviously very<br>
    troubled. Another SCIENTIST is at his side. In the<br>
    b.g. various TECHNICIANS check monitors. It has the<br>
    look of controlled chaos that fills a hurricane center<br>
    during a big storm.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The satellite's trajectory<br>
    continues to deteriorate,<br>
    Captain... This orbit will bring<br>
    it to within five hundred<br>
    kilometers of the planet's<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> GARIN<br>
    We're predicting the atmospheric<br>
    drag will bring it down on the<br>
    next orbit.</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    Have you been able to find any<br>
    explanation for this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, Doctor... it is a most unusual<br>
    phenomenon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Won't the moon disintegrate prior<br>
    to impact?</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    No, it has a ferrous crystaline<br>
    structure and will be able to<br>
    withstand tidal forces, Captain...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Couldn't we just blow it into<br>
    harmless chunks?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The total mass of the moon would<br>
    remain the same, Commander. And<br>
    the impact of thousands of<br>
    fragments would spread destruction<br>
    over an even wider area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/16/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long before impact...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Twenty-nine hours... projected<br>
    somewhere on the western<br>
    continent. It would destroy an<br>
    area eight hundred kilometers in<br>
    radius.</p>
  <p> SCIENTIST<br>
    That damage would be<br>
    insignificant, Captain, compared<br>
    to the seismic repercussions...<br>
    massive landquakes, and<br>
    tsunami...</p>
  <p> GARIN<br>
    The force would raise a cloud of<br>
    dust around the planet, leading<br>
    to a significant temperature<br>
    reduction. We could be looking<br>
    at our own ice age.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (keying insignia)<br>
    Commander La Forge, is there any<br>
    way the Enterprise might be able<br>
    to coax this satellite back where<br>
    it belongs... ?</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI's at a console. SUPERNUMERARIES at various<br>
    positions. The matter/anti-matter blender bubbling with<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd need to apply a delta-vee<br>
    of at least four kilometers per<br>
    second. Even with warp power to<br>
    the tractor beam, it would mean<br>
    exceeding recommended impulse<br>
    engine output by at least<br>
    forty-seven percent. It'd be like<br>
    an ant pushing a tricycle... a<br>
    slim chance at best...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Given a choice between slim and<br>
    none, I'll take slim any day...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, signal all ships<br>
    in this sector to rendezvous and<br>
    join us in relief efforts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Main Viewer)<br>
    We'll keep you informed of our<br>
    progress. Picard out.</p>
  <p>4<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    8</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The tractor beam flares out of the ship and grabs onto<br>
    the small moon. The warp engines flare brighter as we<br>
    apply power. The ship is trying to &quot;plow&quot; the moon<br>
    into a higher orbit.</p>
  <p>10 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. Picard and Riker looking at the viewer.<br>
    The tractor beam holds the small moon. The moon does<br>
    not move.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up and walks closer to the viewer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can you give us any more,<br>
    Geordi... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Not without burning out the<br>
    tractor beam emitter... the<br>
    circuits are already beyond their<br>
    thermal limit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/17/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Delta-vee is ninety-two meters per<br>
    second. The mass is too great.<br>
    We are having an effect but it<br>
    is negligible.</p>
  <p> In the background, a strange noise... it begins low...<br>
    more like a million voices than a million machines...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is that...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unable to identify source...</p>
  <p> It gets louder...</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Impulse engines passing saftey<br>
    limits. We're seconds from<br>
    automatic shutdown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reduce engines... tractor beam<br>
    off...</p>
  <p> The sound continues to grow... and seems to surround<br>
    the ship... they react... almost deafening now...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, what the hell do the sensors<br>
    show... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The sound is not registering,<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> The sound swirling inside and all around... ends with<br>
    a slight POP. Q APPEARS, naked, suspended above<br>
    everyone, as though held by an invisible puppet.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Red Alert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q.</p>
  <p> And Q promptly crashes to the floor. On reactions...</p>

    FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE</p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>17 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As it orbits Bre'el, maintaining its distance to the<br>
    moon, Klyo.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    are no closer to finding a<br>
    solution to the deteriorating<br>
    orbit of the Bre'el Four moon...<br>
    but with the arrival of Q, we now<br>
    have a good idea of the cause.</p>
  <p>18 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Starting with Q putting on his jump suit...</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    We couldn't drive the tractor<br>
    emitters hard enough, Captain...</p>
  <p> Panning to find Picard is getting a debriefing on the<br>
    failed moon attempt from Geordi...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The beam was flexing, and it was<br>
    impossible to transfer enough<br>
    kinetic energy to the moon...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our options?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We did everything by the book and<br>
    a little extra... we need more<br>
    time or more power and we're short<br>
    on both. I'll take a look and see<br>
    if there are any rules I haven't<br>
    broken.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep me advised.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS. Picard turns toward Q with loathing<br>
    in his eyes...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We know you're behind this, Q...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (re: the jumpsuit)<br>
    It's not at all my best color...<br>
    Behind what... what are you<br>
    blathering about, Riker...</p>
  <p> Picard moves to confront him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of twisted pleasure does<br>
    it give you to bring terror into<br>
    their lives... ?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    What? Whose lives?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The millions of people down there<br>
    who are watching as their moon<br>
    falls out of the sky...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I haven't the vaguest idea what<br>
    you're talking about... and I have<br>
    a much more serious problem...<br>
    I am no longer a member of the<br>
    continuum. My superiors have<br>
    decided to punish me.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns... refusing to participate with this<br>
    game of Q's...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And punish us as well, it seems...</p>
  <p> He ignores Q, moves away...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    They said I've spread too much<br>
    chaos through the universe and<br>
    they have stripped me of all my<br>
    powers.</p>
  <p> They look at him with disbelieving eyes. Off their<br>
    reaction --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You do not believe me... ? Would<br>
    I humiliate myself like this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If it served your purposes, yes.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It is the truth. I stand before<br>
    you, defrocked. I'm condemned<br>
    to be a member of this lowest of<br>
    species. A normal, imperfect,<br>
    lumpen human being.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Turning you into a human was part<br>
    of their punishment... ?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    No, it was my request. I could<br>
    have chosen to exist as a<br>
    Markoffian fire lizard or a<br>
    Belzoidian flea, anything I<br>
    wished... so long as it was<br>
    mortal, but I only had a fraction<br>
    of a second to mull and I chose...<br>
    &quot;this&quot;... and asked them to bring<br>
    me here...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Deja Q&quot; - REV. 11/20/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (moving to Picard)<br>
    Because in all the universe you<br>
    are the closest thing I have to<br>
    a friend, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Q smiles to Picard... Picard's look says it all. Data<br>
    aims a tricorder at Q.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is reading as fully human.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (looks around the<br>
    bridge)<br>
    Is there an echo in here?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm even sensing an emotional<br>
    presence in him. I would<br>
    normally describe it as being<br>
    terrified.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    How rude.</p>
  <p> Enough of this... Picard rises, moves back into the<br>
    fray.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q, what is it you want...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Your compassion...<br>
    (a beat, off Picard's<br>
    look)<br>
    All right... Sanctuary on your<br>
    ship... dreary as that may sound<br>
    to both of us...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Return the moon to its orbit.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I have no powers. Q the ordinary.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Q, the liar. Q, the misanthrope.</p>

  <p> Q<br>
    Very clever, Worf. Eat any good<br>
    books lately?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. You wish to be treated as<br>
    a human?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, throw him in the<br>
    brig.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Delighted, Captain.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Jean-Luc... you can't do this...</p>
  <p> Worf moves to him...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will walk or I will carry you.</p>
  <p> Q<br>

  <p> Q (Cont'd)<br>
    To think of the future in this<br>
    shell... forced to cover myself<br>
    with fabric because of outdated<br>
    human morality, to say nothing<br>
    of being too hot or too cold,<br>
    growing feeble as the years pass,<br>
    losing my hair, catching a<br>
    disease, being ticklish, sneezing,<br>
    having an itch, a pimple, bad<br>
    breath, having to bathe...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Too bad.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CORRIDOR (FORMERLY SCENE 20)</p>
  <p> Q and Worf exit the turbolift and walk down the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    &quot;Klingon&quot;... I should have said<br>
    &quot;Klingon&quot;. In my heart, I am a<br>
    Klingon, Worf... So you understand<br>
    I could never survive in<br>
    confinement...<br>
    The universe has been my back<br>
    yard... this is cruel and unusual<br>
    punishment. As a fellow Klingon,<br>
    if you would speak to the captain<br>
    on my behalf, I would be eternally<br>
    grateful... which doesn't mean<br>
    as much as it used to, I admit.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Be quiet or disappear back where<br>
    you came from.</p>
  <p> Worf ushers him in.</p>

  <p> Q (Cont'd)<br>
    If I ask a very simple question,<br>
    do you think you can grasp it<br>
    without troubling your intellect<br>
    too much... ready? If I still<br>
    had powers, would I permit you<br>
    to lock me away?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You have fooled us too often, Q.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Perspicacity incarnate. Please<br>

    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    have sustained light damage from<br>
    an attack by an alien species<br>
    known as the Calamarain. They<br>
    apparently have a grievance with<br>
    Q... no doubt one of many<br>
    lifeforms that do.</p>
  <p>32 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Troi are on the bridge.<br>
    Q paces nervously. His rhetoric remains, but there<br>
    is an underlying fear that we've never seen from him.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The Calamarain are not very<br>
    hospitable creatures. They exist<br>
    as swirls of ionized gas.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What did you do to them to<br>
    motivate such a vengeance?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Nothing bizarre. Nothing<br>
    grotesque.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You tormented them --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    A subjective term, Riker. One<br>
    creature's torment, is another<br>
    creature's delight. They simply<br>
    have no sense of humor... a<br>
    character flaw with which you can<br>
    personally identify.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I say we turn him over to them.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. You knew this would<br>
    happen, didn't you?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I assure you one cannot anticipate<br>
    the Calamarain, Picard... they're<br>
    intelligent, yes... but<br>
    undependable... very flighty...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you have so many enemies, Q,<br>
    of various shapes and sizes...<br>
    certainly you must have been<br>
    concerned that once you became<br>
    mortal... some of them might try<br>
    to look you up...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It occurred to me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With all your chatter about<br>
    &quot;friendship&quot;, the real reason<br>
    you're here is for protection,<br>
    isn't it?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You're so bright, Jean-Luc. Yes,<br>
    of course, you're correct. I know<br>
    human beings. You are all sopping<br>
    over with compassion and<br>
    forgiveness. The human race can't<br>
    wait to absolve almost any<br>
    offense. It's an inherent<br>
    weakness in the breed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What you call weakness, some of<br>
    us would call strength.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Call it what you want, Picard.<br>
    I know you'll protect me even<br>
    though I've tortured you now and<br>
    again...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fighting off every species you've<br>
    insulted would be a full time<br>
    mission. And it's not the one<br>
    I signed up for.</p>

  <p> Q ENTERS... they take a beat to look at each other...<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    You're right, of course. I am<br>
    extraordinarily selfish. It's<br>
    served me so well in the past...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It will not serve you here.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Don't be so hard on me, Jean-Luc.<br>
    You've been mortal all your life.<br>
    You know all about dying. I've<br>
    never given it a second thought.<br>
    Or a first thought for that<br>
    matter.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I could have been killed. If<br>
    not for Data... that one, brief<br>

    been gone. No more me. And<br>
    nobody would have missed me, would<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> Picard looks across at Q for a long, long beat... no<br>
    compassion from our captain here...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And yet Data may have sacrificed<br>
    himself for me. Why? Why would<br>
    he risk his own life for mine?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is his special nature. He<br>
    has learned the lessons of<br>
    humanity well...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I ask myself if I would have done<br>
    the same for him. And I am forced<br>
    to realize the answer is no. And<br>

    to my crew. And to this very<br>
    moment, I am not entirely<br>
    convinced that this is still not<br>
    your latest attempt at a bad joke.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It is a bad joke. On me. I am<br>
    the joke of the universe. The<br>
    king who would be man.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    As I learn more and more about<br>

    foolish... I would never curse<br>
    you by making you human... Let's<br>
    just call it a going away present.</p>
  <p> Data reacts and Q grins at him and suddenly Q<br>
    disappears and Data bursts into a belly laugh...<br>
    reactions...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh, Data... Data? Why are you<br>
    laughing?</p>
  <p> Data collects himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know. But it was a<br>
    wonderful... feeling.</p>

    Mister Data, your analysis...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The moon's altitude is fifty-five<br>
    thousand kilometers, projected<br>
    orbit is nearly circular. There<br>
    is no further danger to the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a look. Picard<br>
    acknowledges, relieved...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Ensign, set a course for<br>
    Station Nigala-Four.<br>

  <p> Q (V.O.)<br>
