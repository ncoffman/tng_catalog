    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is in standard orbit over an old and scarred<br>
    planet. The world is predominantly gray with overtones<br>
    of flecked green and brown and conveys an impression of<br>
    an old battlefield coming back to life.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD and RIKER are standing near an access station<br>
    observing the play of information across one of the<br>
    monitors. WESLEY is at the Conn, DATA is at Ops and<br>
    TROI is in the command area, while SEVERAL N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS are at duty stations or passing through the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Away Team reporting in, Commander.<br>
    Lieutenant Worf standing by.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is Riker, report Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    The archeologists have identified<br>
    the markings in these caverns.<br>
    This planet was apparently once<br>
    home to a race known as the<br>
    Koinonians.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do we know about them, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Koinonians were an intelligent<br>
    culture which became embroiled<br>
    in a war that lasted several<br>
    generations. Our best evidence<br>
    indicates they destroyed<br>
    themselves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/23/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have completed our survey of<br>
    the third tunnel and will proceed<br>
    into the ceremonial chamber.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Affirmative. Enterprise out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Destroyed themselves, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to historical records.<br>
    This will be the first<br>
    opportunity for a Federation<br>
    team...</p>
  <p> At this point, Troi's eyes suddenly go wide.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain! Beam them up quickly!<br>
    They---</p>
  <p> Before she can complete her warning, the voice of Worf<br>
    breaks in over the COM channel.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Emergency beam-up! Enterprise,<br>
    emergency! Injuries. Away---</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room!</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    I've got them, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beam them straight to Sickbay.<br>
    Doctor Crusher, incoming wounded.</p>
  <p> There is a tense pause while they wait for word. Troi<br>
    senses what has happened and shakes her head sadly when<br>
    Riker looks at her.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2A INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> DOCTOR CRUSHER and a MEDICAL ENSIGN move to the Away<br>
    Team as four people MATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/23/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF is crouched in a defensive position over the prone<br>
    and motionless form of LIEUTENANT MARLA ASTER, a woman<br>
    in her early thirties. Worf's phaser is out and at<br>
    the ready while his uniform is singed and slightly<br>
    torn, blood flows from a small wound in his shoulder.<br>
    Behind him are TWO N.D. CREWMEMBERS, who are<br>
    archeological officers. Beverly and Medical<br>
    Supernumeraries move into action...</p>

  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> While Troi is already sure of the result, the rest of<br>
    the Bridge crew waits for word from Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Away Team is aboard, Captain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    One dead on arrival.</p>
  <p> Picard and the Bridge crew react.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 43506.5<br>
    The Enterprise remains in standard<br>
    orbit while we investigate the<br>
    tragedy which has struck the Away<br>
    Team.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard is standing in the doorway. Beverly stands over<br>
    the bed holding Marla Aster's body. Worf stands<br>
    nearby. His uniform bears the evidence of the recent<br>
    violent encounter, blood still seeps from his wound.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant Marla Aster, ship's<br>
    archaeologist has been killed in<br>
    what should have been a routine<br>
    mission. Whatever the<br>
    explanation, it will not bring<br>
    back a valued and trusted officer.</p>
  <p> A MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARY moves the bed Aster's body is<br>
    resting on into an isolated area of Sickbay. Another<br>
    member of the Away Team is being examined by Beverly<br>
    in the background, as Worf makes his report to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 9/1/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We had completed our investigation<br>
    of the third tunnel. Our scans<br>
    had indicated no weapons or traps<br>
    of any kind. Lieutenant Aster<br>
    was three meters behind me. An<br>
    explosive device went off. There<br>
    was no warning. Lieutenant Aster<br>
    bore the full brunt of the<br>
    detonation.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I was in command. I bear full<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant. I have the utmost<br>
    faith that you acted properly and<br>
    in the best traditions of<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves over to Worf.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's take a look at that<br>
    shoulder...</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS the Sickbay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 9/1/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Lieutenant Aster is survived by<br>
    a son, Jeremy. Twelve years old.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What about his father?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is also deceased, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    His only living relatives are an<br>
    aunt and uncle residing on Earth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is the boy now?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In class. I've alerted the<br>
    teacher to expect us.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges. He glances at Beverly, who is<br>
    still troubled by the loss of a patient, but can<br>
    identify with the Captain's unpleasant task. Picard<br>
    and Troi then turn and prepare to leave the Sickbay.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Worf swings off the biobed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I must accompany you. I commanded<br>
    the Away Team.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate the offer but this<br>
    is my responsibility.</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges, unhappily...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Go to your quarters. Rest.<br>
    You're relieved of duty for<br>
    twenty-four hours.</p>
  <p> Worf opens his mouth.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's an order.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS. Picard keys his insignia on their way out.</p>
  <p>6A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Assign Commander La Forge to lead<br>
    another Away Team to the digsite.<br>
    I want to know why this<br>
    happened...</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker at Command. Wesley at Conn, Data at Ops,<br>
    Supernumerary at tactical.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> And pull back to include Wes in the foreground.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    I will be with Counselor Troi and<br>
    young Jeremy Aster.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with sympathy)<br>
    I understand. Riker out.</p>
  <p> Wes exchanges a glance with Riker. A sad memory --</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He had to do the same thing for<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker nods, he knows.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you know Jeremy well?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    But I know what it'll be like for<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's part of life in Starfleet,<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    They're very careful to prepare<br>
    us for... anything. Still...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How can you ever get used to<br>
    it... to telling them... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (softly)<br>
    You hope you never do.</p>
  <p> Data has been listening with interest to this exchange.</p>

  <p>8<br>

    9</p>
  <p>10 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The room is very dark. Worf is dressed in an elaborate<br>
    Klingon robe and sash. A strange, twisted, massive<br>
    candle burns on the desk before him.</p>
  <p> He studies the candle with painful eyes for several<br>
    beats and then hangs his head with shame. He reaches<br>
    out very deliberately, and snuffs the candle with the<br>
    flat side of a knife blade. Darkness.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10A INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Troi and Picard. She senses his frustration.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sense the weight of this duty<br>
    on you, Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard begins to deny it, but then, frustrated --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I really wonder...</p>
  <p> He's almost letting his feelings show, which is not<br>
    at all comfortable for him. He stops the Turbolift<br>
    in mid-trip...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Halt.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift stops...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've always believed that carrying<br>
    children on a starship... it's a<br>
    questionable policy.</p>
  <p> She listens, gives him room...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Serving on a starship means<br>
    accepting certain risks and<br>
    dangers. But did Jeremy Aster<br>
    make that choice?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Death and loss are an integral<br>
    part of life everywhere. Leaving<br>
    the boy on Earth would not have<br>
    protected him from that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, but Earth is not likely to<br>
    be ordered to the Neutral Zone<br>
    to repel a Romulan attack...<br>
    (beat, softer)<br>
    It was my command which sent his<br>
    mother to her death. She<br>
    understood her mission and my<br>
    duty. Will he?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In time. With help.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ensign Crusher does.</p>
  <p> A beat. He glances at her and perhaps we sense that<br>
    Picard wonders if Wesley really ever has come to an<br>
    understanding since they have both avoided the subject.<br>
    In response to that feeling, re-emphasizing --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Yes, he does. And so will Jeremy.</p>
  <p> And she is doing her job for the Captain now...<br>
    easing, but not closing, a lingering issue for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Resume.</p>
  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>12 INT. CLASSROOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi ENTER. The classroom is warm, inviting<br>
    and is crammed with plants, computers, antique books,<br>
    and myriad games from across the Federation. TWO<br>
    TEACHERS are working with SEVERAL STUDENTS in two study<br>
    groups.</p>
  <p> In one group, the age of the students run from roughly<br>
    8 to 13, and they are discussing a particular problem<br>
    on a computer display screen around which they are all<br>
    clustered. In the B.G., is the other study group<br>
    studying other instruction devices. As Picard and Troi<br>
    enter, the students look up in surprise and several<br>
    point at the seldom-seen Captain of their ship.<br>
    Conversation dies to a whisper. The nearest teacher<br>
    hates like hell what his student is about to endure,<br>
    but he stands and crosses to JEREMY ASTER.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    Jeremy, the Captain needs to talk<br>
    with you.</p>
  <p> The boy's eyes go wide at this summons from the<br>
    Captain. He is about twelve years old and has a quiet,<br>
    sensitive look about him, with tousled black hair and<br>
    deep-set eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The other children look at him with reactions ranging<br>
    from jealousy to fear. He walks forward with his<br>
    teacher's arm around his shoulders.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    I'm Jeremy, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/25/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at this innocent young face... the<br>
    eyes of a twelve year old.</p>
  <p> TEACHER<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    My office is over there,<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges. The teacher indicates the way.<br>
    Troi puts her arm around the boy and the trio walks<br>
    out of the room.</p>
  <p>13 OMITTED</p>
  <p>13A INT. TEACHER'S OFFICE (FROM SCENE 13)</p>
  <p> Troi has her hands on Jeremy's shoulders to offer the<br>
    support of physical contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jeremy, it is my sad duty to tell<br>
    you that your mother has died.</p>
  <p> And whatever our expectations might have been, we can<br>
    throw them away. This is a 24th century child. He is<br>
    a good soldier, uniquely mature. Prepared by experts<br>
    to cope with the worst circumstances. There is no tear<br>
    shed.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    How, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An explosive device at the mission<br>
    site. She died instantly.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> Troi drops to one knee to be at his level...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know your mother loved you very<br>
    much, Jeremy.</p>
  <p> He nods. A silence.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Bonding&quot; - REV. 8/23/89 - ACT ONE 12 </p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've been told... you've also lost<br>
    your father.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    Yessir. Five years ago. From<br>
    a Rushton Infection. I'm alone<br>
    now, sir.</p>
  <p> And Picard may wonder just how 'mature' any of us could<br>
    be in this circumstance. But whatever is going on<br>
    inside, the boy does not reveal it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    No one is alone on the starship<br>
    Enterprise, Jeremy. No one.</p>
  <p> As the boy and Picard look in each other's eyes...</p>

  <p>16 INT. ASTER QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi and Jeremy. Troi is seated, watching Jeremy with<br>
    that cool serenity which is so much a part of her<br>
    nature. He doesn't quite know what to do with himself.<br>
    But throughout the scene there is a repressed anger<br>
    in the boy. (NOTE: This is a significant change...<br>
    Even though the dialogue may be similar, the attitude<br>
    behind must reflect unfocused anger that he is<br>
    unwilling to touch.)</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    I really ought to get back to<br>
    class... if I get behind...</p>
  <p> Bringing the focus back --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure your mom wanted you to<br>
    do well in school. Wasn't she<br>
    a teacher on Earth?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    She taught exo-archeology.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why did she sign on the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    She said she wanted to see the<br>
    galaxy with her own eyes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Was she happy doing that?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    (trace of bitterness.)<br>

    a chance this might happen<br>
    someday?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> He moves away from her, seems drawn to the computer<br>
    terminal on his desk. He is completely unaware he is<br>
    doing this, but Troi has spotted the motion.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It might help if we talked about<br>
    how you're feeling.</p>

  <p> JEREMY<br>
    You're a Betazoid. You know how<br>
    I feel.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (conversationally)<br>
    When my father died we were living<br>
    on Betazed. My mother and all<br>
    her people are telepathic. I kept<br>
    wanting to talk about my father,<br>
    and they kept pulling my thoughts<br>
    out of my head before I could say<br>
    the words. It made me very angry.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    (curious despite<br>
    himself)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I needed to say them out loud.<br>
    I was confused about why he went<br>
    away. Was it me -- something I<br>
    had done. I felt that if I could<br>
    just say the words he would<br>
    somehow know how much I loved him<br>
    and missed him.</p>
  <p> She looks at him.</p>

    She just had to do her job. I<br>

    Did she talk to you about her<br>
    mission before she left?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    She told me about the ruins.<br>

    She always made it like a story<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Did you cause the accident?</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    No. I just never had a chance<br>
    to tell her I fixed it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Jeremy, if your mother were here<br>
    right now, would she forgive you?</p>
  <p> Jeremy swallows hard. Still no tears. He nods his<br>
    head, yes, sighs a deep breath. Troi knows that's a<br>
    big step for now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (standing; continuing)<br>
    I want you to have some time<br>
    alone for a little while. I'll<br>
    come back when you're ready to<br>
    talk again.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    How will you know?</p>
  <p> Troi crosses to the boy, hugs him lightly, then still<br>
    holding him in the circle of her arms she smiles down<br>
    at him and says,</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This time I will use my Betazoid<br>

    I have been asked several times<br>

    And I heard you ask Wesley on the<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Human nature, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We feel a loss more intensely<br>
    when it's a friend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But should not the feelings be<br>
    just as deep regardless of who<br>
    has died?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks this over before answering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe they should, Data. Maybe<br>
    if we felt the loss of any life<br>

  <p> JEREMY<br>
    They said you were dead.</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>
    There was a mistake. It's okay.</p>
  <p> Jeremy is confused. He's yearning to accept this, but<br>
    still he holds back.</p>
  <p> JEREMY<br>
    But there was an explosion... you<br>
    were hurt.</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>
    Jeremy, I'm not hurt. I'm fine.<br>
    You mustn't think any more about<br>

  <p> She moves to him. He backs away from her.</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>
    The important thing is, I'll never<br>

    -- you fixed it without even<br>
    being asked.</p>
  <p> This woman is damned convincing. But Jeremy is still<br>
    reluctant to accept her. Marla extends her hand.</p>
  <p> Slowly, cautiously, Jeremy reaches out, touches Marla's<br>
    hand. It's warm and real. Jeremy's surprised. He<br>
    gazes at Marla -- he desperately wants this to be his<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>
    (warm smile)<br>
    I think somebody needs a hug.</p>
  <p> And that does it. Jeremy gives himself up to the<br>
    fantasy, buries himself in his mother's arms, and for<br>
    the first time since the accident, SOBS softly. Marla<br>
    comforts him, strokes his head. Everything's all right<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> After a long beat, Marla pulls back, takes Jeremy's<br>

    No.<br>

    We're going to live in a home just<br>

  <p> MARLA<br>
    The accident on the surface was<br>
    caused by a remnant of an old and<br>
    tragic era. Two species once<br>
    shared this world... one of<br>
    energy... and one of matter. The<br>
    physical beings you call the<br>
    Koinonians destroyed themselves<br>
    in unending, bitter wars. The<br>
    surviving lifeforms on this world<br>
    will not tolerate any further<br>
    suffering from that dishonorable<br>
    past. So they have made this<br>
    possible... they have made me<br>
    possible.</p>

  <p> MARLA<br>
    Your philosophy is curious,<br>

    sorrow? I can provide him an<br>
    existance where he will feel no<br>
    pain, no anguish...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is at the heart of our very<br>
    nature... to feel pain... and<br>
    joy... that is what makes us what<br>
    we are.</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>

    time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, it is quite an undertaking<br>
    you're proposing, isn't it?</p>
  <p> MARLA<br>
    It is our duty to make him happy<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    you wish to create?</p>
  <p> Off her look which is beginning to show doubt...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What will be his reason to live?</p>
  <p> And she cannot answer that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What you offer is a memory... to<br>
    cherish... but not to live in.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is part of our life cycle to<br>
    accept the death of those we love.<br>
    He must deal with grief, not cover<br>
    it or hide from it. We are<br>

    Your mother told me you were<br>
    finding it difficult to talk to<br>
    Jeremy. Why?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't know. I guess... I just<br>
    didn't want to think about it any<br>
    more, you know... all this has<br>
    reminded me so much of that day...</p>

    had been killed.</p>
  <p> Wesley acknowledges...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As I recall, you handled the news<br>
    very well.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    My parents taught me about the<br>
    dangers of starfleet missions.<br>
    I knew it could happen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (probing)<br>
    So you were prepared.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (a beat, introspective)<br>
    No, I don't think I was. Not<br>
    really. How could anyone be...<br>
    prepared to hear that his dad<br>

    I just tried to be what everybody<br>

    Mature.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying you didn't want<br>
    anybody to see how you really<br>
    felt, Wesley?</p>
  <p> And Wesley looks down as the memories sweep across<br>
    him... he looks down, nods. Softly --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So how did you really feel?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    Like somebody kicked me right in<br>

    to tell him for a long time...</p>
  <p> He looks up at Picard with a tear in his eye.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I was angry.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    At you.</p>
  <p> Of course, Picard knows this... but it's important for<br>
    them as well as Jeremy to get it all out now...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why, Wesley? Why were you angry<br>
    with me?</p>
  <p> Wesley backs away from the feelings... he's gone as far<br>
    as he's comfortable... he shrugs... but that's not<br>
    enough...</p>

    No.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why?</p>
  <p> Softly, painfully, outloud for the first time...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Because you led the mission. You<br>
    came back. My father didn't.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges... moves away as Troi moves in with<br>
    great compassion...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How long were you angry with<br>
    Captain Picard, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A long time.<br>

    But not any more. Not even a<br>
    little, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes close for a moment. He bows his head,<br>
    almost imperceptively. That wound is forever closed.<br>
    To Jeremy --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you Jeremy... must be very<br>
    angry with Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> And Worf is caught off guard as the attention turns to<br>
    him. Jeremy looks at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He was in charge of your mother's<br>
    mission. Just as Captain Picard<br>
    was in command when Wesley's father<br>
    was killed. Isn't that right,<br>
    Jeremy</p>
  <p> Jeremy looks at Worf.</p>

  <p> JEREMY<br>
    Why? Why weren't you the one who<br>
    died? Why did it have to be her?</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    The Marla Aster I knew and honored<br>
    is not in this room. Nor does<br>
    she await you on the planet. Now<br>
    she lives only here...<br>
    (touches his chest)<br>
    And here.</p>
  <p> Jeremy looks up to him through his tears. He cannot<br>
    speak.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Jeremy)<br>
    Join with me in the R'uustai, the<br>
    Bonding. You will become part<br>
    of my family now and for all time.<br>
    We will be brothers.</p>
  <p> Worf offers his hand. Jeremy never looks back again<br>
    at Marla... he stretches out a hand ??ndly to grasp<br>
    for Worf's hand. The Klingon is the ?? From a simple<br>
    handclasp he pulls the boy to him. Marla and Picard<br>
    regard each other for a long moment. She understands<br>
    she is no longer needed. She nods to Picard. She<br>
    lowers her head. She disappears. The room goes back<br>
    to normal -- the Aster quarters.</p>

  <p> Worf in full Klingon regalia. Jeremy is dressed in<br>
    a child's version of the Klingon robe. Jeremy and Worf<br>
    are framed by the window of the stateroom. The room is<br>
    dark. Five of the intricate candles are on various<br>
    tables in the B.G. One is lit.</p>
  <p> Worf removes his sash, and places it across Jeremy's<br>
    shoulders. He and Jeremy take a candle, and walk to<br>
    the lit candle. They light theirs. They go through<br>
    the room lighting the other candles.</p>
  <p> Worf finishes. Watches Jeremy. He stands looking out<br>
    at the stars.</p>
