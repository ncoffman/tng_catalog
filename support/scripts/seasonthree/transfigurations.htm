    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise in orbit around a small planetoid.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 43957.2.<br>
    We are presently charting an<br>
    unknown star system located in<br>
    the Zeta Gelis cluster. This<br>
    rather routine assignment has made<br>
    for a refreshingly quiet time<br>
    aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>2 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> GEORDI and WORF are at the bar. Geordi discreetly<br>
    indicates a young woman sitting with a friend (it is<br>
    CHRISTY, whom we last saw in &quot;Booby Trap&quot; telling<br>
    Geordi that she wasn't interested in him &quot;that way&quot;).</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's her.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't stare.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Because she'll see.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good. You must let her see the<br>
    fire in your eyes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But what would I say... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/28/90 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (acting the wise<br>
    Lothario)<br>
    Words come later, it is the scent<br>
    that first speaks of love.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/27/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks Worf, that really helps<br>
    me a lot.</p>
  <p> Geordi sees Christy get up with a couple empty glasses<br>
    and head toward the bar. He quickly turns toward Worf<br>
    and tries to blend into the woodwork, but she ends up<br>
    standing right behind him as she waits for her refills.<br>
    She recognizes him:</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    Hi, Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (turning around)<br>
    Hi, Christy.</p>
  <p> A long silence. Christy waits for Geordi to continue,<br>
    but Geordi doesn't know what to say. She knows he has<br>
    a crush on her and tries to draw him out.</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    So... how have you been?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Another long silence. Christy tries again.</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    How are things down in<br>
    Engineering?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Fine... uh really... fine.</p>
  <p> Another long silence. Christy finally gives up.</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    Well, see you around.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods and she EXITS. Worf turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have much to teach you about<br>
    women.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Mister La Forge, report to<br>
    Transporter Room three.</p>
  <p> As Geordi reacts...</p>

    3A</p>
  <p>3B INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> RIKER, BEVERLY, and DATA are moving rapidly down the<br>
    corridor towards the Transporter Room. A Turbolift<br>
    OPENS and Geordi ENTERS. He quickly falls in step with<br>
    the others.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's this all about, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Sensors have discovered a small<br>
    one-man ship crashed on the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We're picked up life-signs...<br>
    humanoid, very faint and fading.</p>
  <p> They EXIT into the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. THE PLANET'S SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Away Team MATERIALIZES in front of the shattered<br>
    hull of the wrecked escape pod.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (using tricorder)<br>
    Radiation levels within acceptable<br>
    limits.</p>
  <p> As they get closer, we see the injured humanoid. He is<br>
    unconscious, in a state of shock. Half his body is<br>
    trapped under a mass of bent steel; he has a nasty head<br>
    wound. His right arm is severed. Beverly moves<br>
    quickly to him and uses her medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can beam him out from under<br>
    there, get him up to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's not stable enough for<br>
    transport. There's damage to his<br>
    brain stem, his autonomic<br>
    functions are failing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/27/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His heart needs active neural<br>
    feedback, it can't regulate<br>
    itself. I need a volunteer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm here.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm going to hook your nervous<br>
    systems together through my<br>
    tricorder -- your brain will<br>
    regulate both systems. That<br>
    should stabilize him long enough<br>
    to get him up to the ship.</p>
  <p> The following takes a matter of seconds... she affixes<br>
    a neural pad to the base of each of her patient's<br>
    skulls. Thin fiber optic cables lead out from these<br>
    pads and connect to her tricorder. She flips a switch<br>
    and the tricorder starts beeping in synch with Geordi's<br>
    heartbeat.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Take deep, regular breaths. If<br>
    anything goes wrong I'll break<br>
    the connection.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods. She activates the device. Two heartbeats<br>
    can now be heard. Suddenly, a strange COLOR WASH moves<br>
    along the fiber from the humanoid to Geordi.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (ready to break<br>
    connection)<br>
    Geordi!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm fine... no problem.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Transporter Room, three to beam<br>
    directly to Sickbay.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. JOHN'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> Patient &quot;John Doe&quot; has just been placed in a special<br>
    emergency surgical bed. Electrodes are feverishly<br>
    being attached to his head and chest. Beverly, NURSE<br>
    TEMPLE, and SEVERAL MEDICAL CREWPERSONS are working on<br>
    John.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to a nurse)<br>
    Autonomic responses are still<br>
    low... begin cardiostimulation...<br>
    (to another nurse)<br>
    Sixty cc's of inoprovaline...<br>
    massive infection is setting in...<br>
    use the protodynoplaser to<br>
    stabilize his immune system.<br>
    (looking at monitor)<br>
    We need to design a virus that<br>
    can infiltrate his cell structure<br>
    and boost his ATP production.</p>
  <p> The team moves into action.</p>
  <p> TEMPLE<br>
    What about Commander La Forge...<br>
    he's waiting in the diagnostic<br>
    center.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I want you to give him a full<br>
    bioscan. See if there are any<br>
    residual effects from that energy<br>
    discharge during the neuro-link.</p>
  <p> Temple nods and EXITS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to another nurse)<br>
    Keep his arm in cryogenic stasis<br>
    until his vital signs are strong<br>
    enough to begin surgical<br>
    procedures.</p>
  <p> Beverly leans over her patient as if trying to gauge<br>
    his chances for survival... at the moment they don't<br>
    look good...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/28/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, Riker, Data, and Worf are on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    From the size and shape of the<br>
    wreckage, it appeared to be some<br>
    kind of escape pod. The control<br>
    system had been heavily damaged,<br>
    that's probably what caused the<br>
    crash.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thoughtfully)<br>
    An escape pod... then it couldn't<br>
    have travelled very far. Mister<br>
    Data, any signs of other ships<br>
    in this area?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (works console)<br>
    I am picking up a scattering of<br>
    debris in extended orbit around<br>
    the planet. It reads as refined<br>
    metals and other synthetic<br>
    compounds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The remains of a larger vessel.<br>
    He must have left in the pod<br>
    before the ship was destroyed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (works console)<br>
    Sensors show trace elements in<br>
    the debris that would indicate<br>
    phaser fire was recently<br>
    exchanged.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were you able to salvage anything<br>
    from the escape pod?</p>
  <p> Data holds up a small gel-filled capsule.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is all that is left of the<br>
    pod's computer system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you access it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 4/3/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It will take time. Downloading<br>
    it into our system will require<br>
    fabrication of a matrix translator<br>
    to emulate the alien's computer<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep me apprised of your progress.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Data moves to the aft science station.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit.</p>
  <p>8 INT. JOHN'S SICKBAY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two hours later. Doctor Crusher has successfully<br>
    reattached her patient's arm and high-tech bandages<br>
    now cover the wound. Beverly looks fatigued. Temple<br>
    is monitoring some equipment.</p>
  <p> TEMPLE<br>
    Limb re-fusion appears to have<br>
    been successful, Doctor.<br>
    Tissue oxygenation is within<br>
    norms.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's all we can do for now.<br>
    We won't be able to test<br>
    neuromuscular function for a few<br>
    days.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Can I go now, Doc?</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a padd and examines the results of<br>
    Geordi's examination.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No need to keep you here. Your<br>
    bioscan came out negative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/28/90 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I could have told you that. I<br>
    feel great.</p>
  <p> As Geordi turns to leave, Picard ENTERS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/28/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (indicating John)<br>
    How's your patient, Beverly?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I never thought he'd make it this<br>
    far. There was major trauma to<br>
    the head and chest cavity, massive<br>
    plasma loss, and severe damage<br>
    to most of his organs.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What are his chances?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I believe he'll live... but I'm<br>
    afraid I can't take the credit<br>
    for it. His body is showing<br>
    amazing recuperative powers. The<br>
    damaged tissue is repairing itself<br>
    at a phenomenal rate.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There's only one thing that<br>
    troubles me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Take a look at this.</p>
  <p> Beverly goes to a wall monitor and taps it. A graphic<br>
    display of cells undergoing rapid transformation comes<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cell regeneration?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... the thing is that it has<br>
    nothing to do with his injuries.<br>
    These are undamaged cells, but<br>
    they seem to be mutating.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any theory as to what's causing<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shaking head)<br>
    No. I've never seen anything like<br>
    it. It's possible this could be<br>
    part of his natural healing<br>
    process. I hope it is... because<br>
    there's nothing I can do to stop<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> On display as the cells rapidly mutate...</p>
  <p>9 OMITTED</p>
  <p>9A INT. TEN FORWARD (FORMERLY SCENES 17-20)</p>
  <p> Geordi, Worf, and Data are seated at one of the tables.<br>
    Geordi and Data are deep in conversation, while Worf<br>
    looks a little bored. Geordi is holding the storage<br>
    capsule.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm telling you Data, there's got<br>
    to be some way to decode the<br>
    information in this thing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I agree Geordi. But the data<br>
    matrix within the capsule does<br>
    not correspond to any standard<br>
    format. All we have been able<br>
    to determine is that the device<br>
    uses a chemically based system<br>
    for molecular energy encoding.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, and the computer still<br>
    can't analyze the specific<br>
    chemical elements involved. It's<br>
    got to be part of the data<br>
    processing system...<br>
    (a beat as he thinks)<br>
    What if it's a feedback loop<br>
    controller?</p>
  <p> Data is very interested in this new line of pursuit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The compact shape does suggest<br>
    a rapid chemical processing and<br>
    storage capacity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>9A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We found it close to the escape<br>
    pod instrumentation assemblage...<br>
    this capsule might process the<br>
    ship's dynamic motions and augment<br>
    the manual control inputs.<br>
    (getting a little<br>
    excited)<br>
    We could send it a few test<br>
    signals... make it think the<br>
    entire assemblage was awake and<br>
    operating.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    An intriguing experiment. The<br>
    capsule might provide us with<br>
    information without the need to<br>
    decode the storage medium itself.<br>
    Perhaps we could examine your<br>
    theory immediately.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with usual Klingon<br>
    intensity)<br>
    Less talk, more synthehol.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We came here to relax.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I am relaxed. In fact, I've never<br>
    felt better.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and waves over a WAITER for another round.<br>
    As he turns, he sees Christy at the bar talking with<br>
    a FEMALE CREWPERSON. She sees him and gives him a<br>
    friendly wave.</p>
  <p>9B ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> His attitude and demeanor are in marked contrast to<br>
    the first scene with Christy in the Teaser. A smile<br>
    breaks out on his face and he confidently gets up from<br>
    the table and starts to head for the bar.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But you know, Worf you do have<br>
    a point.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    I think the storage capsule can<br>
    wait awhile.</p>
  <p> They watch in surprise as he heads for the bar.</p>
  <p>9C NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> on Christy and Geordi. Christy has just said good-bye<br>
    to her friend and is on her way out when Geordi<br>
    smoothly intercepts her. She is a little surprised<br>
    by Geordi's change in attitude, but welcomes it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hi. Not leaving, are you?</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    Oh hi, Geordi... I was just on<br>
    my way down to the arboretum.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Care for some company?</p>
  <p> CHRISTY<br>
    (warm smile)<br>
    I'd love some. But I didn't think<br>
    you were interested... in that<br>
    kind of thing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (taking her arm)<br>
    There are a lot of things you<br>
    don't know about me.</p>
  <p> Geordi matches her smile with one of his own and they<br>
    EXIT arm in arm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/30/90 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>9D ON WORF AND DATA</p>
  <p> as they watch Geordi and Christy leave. Worf nods his<br>
    head in approval.</p>

  <p>10 INT. JOHN'S SICKBAY ROOM</p>
  <p> We see that the patient has been removed from the<br>
    emergency surgical bed and is now lying on an ordinary<br>
    sickbay bed.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (V.O.)<br>
    Medical Log, Stardate 43958.8.<br>
    I have removed patient &quot;John Doe&quot;<br>
    from the emergency bio-support<br>
    unit. In just thirty-six hours<br>
    most of his major organ systems<br>
    have regenerated themselves to<br>
    the point where they can now<br>
    function on their own.</p>
  <p> Beverly crosses over to John's side. She is leaning<br>
    against the bed and looking up at a diagnostic<br>
    monitor... she turns to move away from the bed when<br>
    suddenly... his arm stabs out and grasps her wrist.<br>
    Beverly is startled, and whirls around in fear.</p>
  <p>10A ANGLE ON JOHN</p>
  <p> as his eyes open. He looks around in momentary<br>
    bewilderment... then looks up at Beverly... he breaks<br>
    into a smile so rich and deep that her fear evaporates<br>
    and she finds herself smiling back.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (gratified)<br>
    I am... alive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You certainly are.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 43960.6.<br>
    Our mission to map the Zeta Gelis<br>
    star cluster is proceeding on<br>
    schedule. Meanwhile, Doctor<br>
    Crusher reports that the recovery<br>
    of the patient she has named John<br>
    Doe continues at a remarkable<br>
    pace.</p>
  <p>14 INT. JOHN'S SICKBAY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room has several devices designed for physical<br>
    rehabilitation scattered around it. The circular disc<br>
    that hangs over the operating table in Sickbay now<br>
    hangs here and dominates the room. There are a few<br>
    subtle changes in the disc to suggest small devices and<br>
    sensors. John is reclining in a chair beneath the<br>
    disc. Small BEAMS OF LIGHT lance down from the disc<br>
    and move along John's limbs. Beverly is standing at<br>
    a nearby console monitoring the therapy. John's<br>
    attitude is bright, positive. He is vibrant and full<br>
    of confidence as he goes through his rehabilitation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Are you experiencing any<br>
    discomfort?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    None. I can feel the life<br>
    returning to my body.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (impressed)<br>
    Your neurofibrowaves are<br>
    functioning almost normally again.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That puts you... about six weeks<br>
    ahead of my original schedule.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/28/90 - ACT TWO 13.</p>
  <p>15 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly works the console and the beams STOP. She<br>
    picks up some medical bands about the size and shape<br>
    of dog collars and begins to attach them to John's arms<br>
    and legs.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    That should give you and your<br>
    colleagues something to talk<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're all we've talked about<br>
    since your arrival.</p>
  <p> John is pleased and enthusiastic.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    I believe I'm ready for the next<br>
    phase of my treatment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (light)<br>
    You're right... I think it's time<br>
    you stopped taking up valuable<br>
    bedspace.</p>
  <p> John smiles.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now remember... you've been off<br>
    your feet for almost a month.<br>
    These motor assist bands will<br>
    provide electrical stimulation<br>
    to your arms and legs. They'll<br>
    help you re-learn to control your<br>
    muscles.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now, don't be disappointed if your<br>
    mobility is restricted at first...<br>
    your limbs are still weak.</p>
  <p> John is clearly excited at the prospect of getting up.<br>
    Beverly completes the process of attaching the bands<br>
    and then stands up. She pulls out a tricorder to<br>
    monitor him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/27/90 - ACT TWO 14.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    I appreciate your concern Doctor.<br>
    But I think I'm going to surprise<br>
    you again. I feel strong enough<br>
    to fly.</p>
  <p> John slowly gets up. He smiles, glad to be on his<br>
    feet. He takes a few confident steps and then loses<br>
    his balance and collapses on the floor. Beverly moves<br>
    over to him quickly. John smiles ruefully.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    But perhaps I should concentrate<br>
    on walking first.</p>
  <p> Beverly returns his smile and helps him to his feet.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's try again. But this time...<br>
    a little more slowly.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (grins)<br>
    Much more slowly.</p>
  <p> John hesitantly begins to walk, stiff-limbed. Beverly<br>
    close at his side. He totters a moment and has to lean<br>
    on her for support. John starts to walk again without<br>
    her help. As he walks, we can see his strength<br>
    starting to return. John begins to flex his arms and<br>
    hands... his face shows sheer joy as life returns to<br>
    his limbs. Beverly is sharing in his infectious joy.</p>
  <p>16 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard ENTERS. Picard, who has met John before,<br>
    realizes that he is witnessing a key moment in John's<br>
    recuperation and watches without interrupting. John<br>
    begins to walk a little too fast once more and loses<br>
    his balance near Picard, who quickly catches him before<br>
    he falls. Picard helps John to regain his balance and<br>
    then lets him go.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    I envy your reflexes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I envy your strength of will.<br>
    Doctor Crusher has kept me<br>
    informed of your progress. It's<br>
    quite extraordinary.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    I have an extraordinary doctor.<br>
    She gave me back my life. I hope<br>
    that I'm worthy of her efforts.</p>
  <p> Beverly beams as she and John share a moment of pride<br>
    over what they've accomplished together. John girds<br>
    himself and starts walking again. Beverly monitors him<br>
    closely as he slowly moves around the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me John, are you still unable<br>
    to recall anything at all about<br>
    your past?</p>
  <p> At the mention of his past, John's expression clouds.<br>
    His bright and vibrant personality seems dimmed.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    No... my memories begin the moment<br>
    I woke up in Sickbay.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doctor Crusher told me... you<br>
    think I was in some kind of<br>
    battle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're quite certain of that. But<br>
    you have no idea how you came to<br>
    be in that escape pod, or what<br>
    happened to your ship?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (shaking his head)<br>
    No. Believe me, Captain it's a<br>
    horrible feeling. Not knowing<br>
    who you are, where you're from...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Have you tried synaptic<br>
    induction?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His neural nets don't conform<br>
    to any known patterns.<br>
    Conventional neurotherapy has<br>
    proven ineffective. Hopefully,<br>
    in time, his memory pathways will<br>
    reestablish themselves naturally.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Suddenly John puts a hand to his stomach and his face<br>
    contorts in momentary agony. Beverly moves to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That same pain again?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (tight)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> The pain ends and his features relax.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (with shaky smile)<br>
    I think I've made enough progress<br>
    for one day.</p>
  <p> Beverly is scanning him, but doesn't know what to make<br>
    of the readings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Not a relapse I hope.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    This has nothing to do with his<br>
    wounds. I think it's related<br>
    to the continuing mutation of his<br>
    cell structure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Still no theory as to what's<br>
    causing it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    None. I've run every test I could<br>
    think of... it just doesn't make<br>
    any sense.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>

    while John practices flexing and stretching his<br>
    muscles. The door to Sickbay OPENS and O'BRIEN ENTERS<br>
    wearing a kayaking outfit. He is holding his shoulder<br>
    and has a rueful expression on his face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What happened to you?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I was... uh... kayaking on the<br>
    Holodeck again.</p>
  <p> Beverly quickly scans his shoulder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And now you've dislocated your<br>
    shoulder. Sit down, I'll get the<br>

  <p> O'Brien grunts in pain. Wesley shakes his head. He<br>
    smiles in greeting to John. They've obviously met<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hey... not bad.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Your mother promised me a tour<br>

    (confidentially)<br>
    You may find this hard to believe,<br>
    but Sickbay can be an incredibly<br>
    boring place.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (toward lab)<br>
    Hey Doc... I'm dying here.</p>
  <p>22 ON JOHN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> John looks at O'Brien... sees his discomfort... a look<br>
    of gentle compassion comes over his features. John<br>
    goes over to O'Brien and puts his hand on his injured<br>
    shoulder just as Beverly ENTERS from the lab in the<br>
    b.g.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Don't worry my friend... you'll<br>
    be alright.</p>
  <p> There is a brief COLOR WASH on O'Brien's shoulder (like<br>
    the light that hit Geordi in the Teaser). O'Brien is<br>
    surprised. He moves his arm around experimentally.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    sits.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've run every test and scan that<br>
    I can think of... there's no<br>
    physiological evidence that would<br>
    indicate he would possess such<br>
    powers. But then, there's so much<br>
    about John that's a mystery...</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You know... I really like him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    He does have a certain charm<br>
    doesn't he? The whole medical<br>
    staff has commented on it.</p>
  <p> Wesley studies his mom for a second. He can tell<br>
    there's more to this than Beverly is letting on. He<br>
    is genuinely interested in her feelings without being<br>
    threatened by them.</p>

    There's a strength and serenity<br>
    about him that's very attractive.<br>
    Yet, he's filled with such pain<br>
    and turmoil... he's so<br>
    vulnerable. I find him... very<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    Sounds like there's more to it<br>
    than that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is that your way of asking if I'm<br>
    getting romantically involved with<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You said it, I didn't.</p>
  <p> Beverly searches to explain her confused feelings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    My feelings toward him aren't<br>
    romantic... exactly. I mean...<br>
    I know that the... doctor/patient<br>
    relationship can sometimes create<br>
    a... false sense of intimacy...<br>

    Data, I was thinking about the<br>

    we've been going about it the<br>

    What if it is a biochemical<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you suggesting that it<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, it does contain quantities<br>
    of nucleic acids.</p>

  <p> John is shocked.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Home?</p>
  <p> MOVE to reveal Beverly and Picard in the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... using the information we<br>
    found in your escape pod, we may<br>
    be able to return you to your<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> It takes John a few moments to sort out his feelings.<br>
    His expression changes for a moment... his words slip<br>
    out, without conscious thought.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (almost a whisper)<br>
    I... cannot go back.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly exchange a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And why is that?</p>
  <p> There is a beat as John thinks. Then with a shock of<br>
    realization...</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (certain)<br>
    You must not take me home,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    John, your memory... has it<br>
    returned?</p>
  <p> John is trying desperately to remember, but specific<br>
    memories stay tantalizingly out of reach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/27/90 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    All I know is that we came out<br>
    here to escape.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Escape what?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There were others with you?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (searching)<br>
    Yes... I was not... alone. But<br>
    what happened to the others or<br>
    what we were escaping from... I<br>
    cannot remember.<br>
    (to Picard with passion)<br>
    But I do know that I cannot go<br>
    back... not yet.</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly are a little taken aback by the<br>
    conviction and determination of John.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will not arrive in your star<br>
    system for at least three weeks.<br>
    That gives us plenty of time to<br>
    discuss this matter further.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hopefully by then, you'll have<br>
    regained more of your memory.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (relieved)<br>
    You're right of course. I<br>
    apologize for my outburst,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is... understandable.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and EXITS. Beverly smiles at John with<br>
    reassurance and then EXITS. John gets up and moves<br>
    over to a cup of water sitting on a table.</p>

  <p> as he reaches for the cup. He doubles over in more<br>
    intense pain that we saw earlier... the spasm lasts<br>
    longer this time. With great effort, he tries to<br>
    release the pain by sheer will. The pain subsides<br>
    after a final spasm and a BRIGHT YELLOWISH GLOW moves<br>
    quickly from his chest to along his arms and then<br>
    disappears. Hold on John... bewildered and<br>
    frightened.</p>

  <p> Beverly and John ENTER. The room is filled with<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES... a busy, lively atmosphere. John<br>
    and Beverly pause near the bar.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    This ship is astounding. It seems<br>
    to stretch on without end.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We can see the rest of it some<br>
    other time. This is your first<br>
    day out of Sickbay... I don't want<br>
    you to overexert yourself.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    (glancing around)<br>
    This looks like an ideal place<br>
    to rest.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    My thoughts exactly.</p>
  <p> They walk over to an empty table and sit down. John<br>
    looks around the room at the activity surrounding them.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Truly remarkable.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    These people... they're all so<br>
    different from one another... yet<br>
    they work together freely.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Is it that surprising?</p>
  <p> John thinks this over.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    It is... new to me.</p>

  <p> JOHN<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    My people are different...<br>
    somehow. If only I could<br>
    remember!<br>

    Yesterday... for one terrifying<br>
    moment, there was clarity.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You mean that energy pulse... ?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Yes. For that moment, my purpose<br>
    seemed clear... but then it was<br>
    gone.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The pain... the energy pulse...<br>
    they must all be linked to the<br>
    cell mutation in your body.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I wish there was some way I could<br>
    help you get to the truth.</p>
  <p> John gives her a warm smile. His own pain forgotten...<br>
    only looking to reassure her.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Thank you... Beverly, you've done<br>
    so much for me already. I only<br>
    wish there was some way I could<br>
    repay you.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But you have...</p>
  <p> John gives her a gentle but questioning look. Beverly<br>
    is a little embarrassed, yet she feels compelled to<br>
    tell him her personal feelings.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The... friendship... that we've<br>
    developed has made me... very<br>
    happy.</p>
  <p> John thinks this over for a few seconds. They both<br>
    realize that each has strong feelings towards the<br>
    other, but both know that they cannot take their<br>
    relationship any further.</p>

  <p> JOHN<br>
    The rapport that exists between<br>
    us... also means a great deal<br>
    to me.<br>
    (beat with deep<br>
    conviction)<br>
    But I believe that I am on some<br>
    kind of journey. Whatever brought<br>
    me here... whatever is happening<br>
    to my body... it's all part of<br>
    that journey... and I must<br>
    complete it... before any other<br>
    consideration.</p>
  <p> Beverly knows that John is right, but nevertheless<br>
    there is still that strong attraction between them.<br>
    A solemn bittersweet moment as they both reflect on<br>
    what might have been.</p>

    but down on the planet, you gave<br>
    me something... a new confidence.</p>
  <p> John smiles.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    I doubt I can take credit for<br>
    that... Perhaps I only helped<br>
    you find something you already<br>
    had.</p>

  <p>53 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Picard takes his seat, looks at the Main Viewer. On<br>
    it is an alien spaceship -- very sleek, very military.</p>

    Alien vessel approaching at<br>
    half-impulse, heading zero-five-one<br>

    Mister Worf, hail the alien<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    They continue to ignore our hails,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> Data reacts to a readout on his panel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are scanning us, Captain.</p>
  <p> John steps up to Picard and Beverly, his eyes on the<br>
    Main Viewer.</p>
  <p>54 WIDER</p>
  <p> as Picard notices John's cold, hard-edged expression;<br>
    it's the expression John gets when thinking of his<br>
    past. Picard gives John a look -- &quot;do you recognize<br>
    that ship? John shrugs helplessly -- he doesn't know.</p>
  <p> Worf works his panel:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are answering our hail,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>55 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The image of the approaching ship is replaced with<br>
    SUNAD, an imposing Zalkonian humanoid physiologically<br>
    similar to John but whose attire and demeanor is much<br>
    more military, more aggressive, almost Draconian.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/29/90 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Sunad sees John, glares at him with hostility. John<br>
    reacts to the sight of Sunad; Picard picks up on it:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know him?</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Yes... I don't know how, but...<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    He's dangerous...</p>
  <p> Picard nods and steps up toward the Viewer.</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    I am Commander Sunad, of Zalkon.<br>
    You are trespassing into our<br>
    space... and you are holding a<br>
    Zalkonian citizen.</p>
  <p> Troi, standing near Picard, studies John's reaction<br>
    to Sunad almost as intently as she studies Sunad. John<br>
    appears confused, showing a mixture of fear and<br>
    contempt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of<br>
    the United Federation of Planets.<br>
    We intend no transgression of --</p>
  <p> Sunad, still eyeing John with loathing, interrupts:</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    You will return him to us<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at John. John shakes his head -- he<br>
    doesn't want to go.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: John)<br>
    Sunad -- this individual is our<br>
    guest. We found him dying in a<br>
    shipwreck and returned him to<br>
    health.</p>
  <p> But Sunad is unappreciative:</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    Then you have aided a criminal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/29/90 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> This is all new information to John -- yet he doesn't<br>
    deny it.</p>
  <p> SUNAD (cont'd)<br>
    He is one of four escaped<br>
    prisoners. We eliminated the<br>
    other three.</p>
  <p> John's expression betrays a flash of pain and anger.</p>
  <p> SUNAD (cont'd)<br>
    We thought this one dead as well.<br>
    Return him so we may complete our<br>
    task.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of what is he accused?</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    He is a disruptive influence.<br>
    He spreads lies... encourages<br>
    dissent... disturbs the natural<br>
    order of our society.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In what way?</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    That is not your concern.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I will give you two hours to<br>
    comply.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    The Zalkonian ship has a<br>
    formidable armament. Their<br>
    weaponry is comparable to ours.</p>

    They're just as fast -- and<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor. Do they mean to carry<br>
    out their threat?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I believe so. Sunad's hatred for<br>
    John was evident... but there's<br>
    something else. The Zalkonians<br>
    fear John.</p>
  <p> Picard contemplates all this. After a beat, he heads<br>
    for the Observation Lounge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker, Counselor,<br>
    Doctor. John, I'd like you to<br>
    join us.</p>
  <p> Riker, Troi, Beverly, and John follow Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Mister Data, you have the Bridge.<br>
    Mister Worf -- stay at Tactical.<br>
    Counter any moves the Zalkonian<br>
    makes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>57 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Beverly, John. John is<br>
    distressed, straining with all his might to be of help,<br>
    to remember.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    I can neither confirm nor deny<br>
    what the Zalkonians told you.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression gives no indication of whether he<br>
    believes John or not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They make serious accusations<br>
    against you...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Transfigurations&quot; - REV. 3/29/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Their accusations may be true.<br>
    I don't know. I don't believe<br>
    I am a criminal...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You understand the difficult<br>
    position in which I'm placed.</p>
  <p> Meaning Picard may have to turn John over. John locks<br>
    eyes with Picard -- he understands.</p>
  <p> JOHN<br>
    Completely. And I refuse to place<br>
    your ship in danger. If<br>
    necessary, I'll surrender to them.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But I'm convinced there's more<br>
    at stake here than my life...<br>
    there's something... important<br>
    I must complete... my survival<br>
    is vital.</p>
  <p> John realizes how vague that sounds; he's frustrated<br>
    he can't be more specific.</p>
  <p> JOHN (cont'd)<br>
    If I could explain it, I would...</p>
  <p> After a beat, Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll inform you of my decision<br>
    shortly.</p>
  <p> It's a dismissal; John EXITS. Once he's gone:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, you can't seriously be<br>
    considering --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    We must consider all options,<br>
    Doctor, without letting our<br>
    personal feelings impede our<br>
    judgment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're going to tell me it's<br>
    irrelevant that we'd be sending<br>
    him to his death...</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly. Whether we approve of<br>
    the Zalkonians' motives is not<br>
    at issue.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    For what it's worth, I suspect<br>
    John may be correct that his<br>
    existence has broader<br>
    ramifications than that of a<br>
    simple criminal.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sunad thinks so. He feels<br>
    personally threatened by John.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (agreeing)<br>
    Sunad called John a &quot;disruptive<br>
    influence.&quot; That's hardly a<br>
    capital offense --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is not up to us to judge their<br>
    laws, Doctor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know how I'd feel if the<br>
    situation were reversed... if they<br>
    were in our territory, holding<br>
    a Federation citizen.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The Zalkonians truly don't<br>
    understand our indecision about<br>
    returning John. In their eyes,<br>
    we shouldn't be involved.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, let me remind you we<br>
    are on a mission of exploration...<br>
    our purpose is to establish<br>

  <p> SUNAD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that is your wish -- we will<br>
    respect it.</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    We simply want you to leave<br>
    Zalkonian space as soon as you<br>
    return the criminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, we will leave. It is<br>

    he has to say.</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    But before I return the survivor<br>
    to you, I would appreciate a more<br>
    detailed explanation of what he<br>
    has done to merit a death<br>
    sentence.</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    (bristling again)<br>
    As I said -- it is not your<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. However, there are<br>
    circumstances of which you may<br>
    be unaware. The survivor has<br>
    suffered a memory loss -- he is,<br>
    therefore, ill-equipped to defend<br>
    himself against your accusations.</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    (getting angry)<br>
    There is no defense. Our judgment<br>
    is final.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Since his recovery, he has<br>

  <p> Sunad reacts, fearing the worst.</p>
  <p> SUNAD<br>
    What kind of abilities?</p>

  <p> As the COLOR WASH envelops Beverly, her throat<br>
    constriction vanishes.</p>
  <p> John looks at his glowing hands. Realization sinks in<br>

    command. On the Viewer, Sunad reacts -- the calm self<br>
    assurance in John's manner frightens him, but he acts<br>
    tough in a vain attempt to hide his terror. He barks<br>
    orders to someone o.s.:</p>
