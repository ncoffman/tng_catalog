    4</p>
  <p>5 EXT. GALORNDON SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A hellish environment bathed in a BLUE-HUED light.<br>
    Cold and dusty (it is always night), the planet is<br>
    whipped by gale force winds. Visibility is only a few<br>
    feet. Crackling blue ARCS of electricity slash across<br>
    the sky. RIKER, WORF and GEORDI MATERIALIZE. It is<br>
    an immediate struggle to see. Riker lays a marker down<br>
    on the ground where they beamed in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Marking beam-out position.<br>
    Return transport: fourteen<br>
    minutes, forty seconds.</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker light their palm beacons... beams of<br>
    light shoot out... it doesn't help a lot.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your view any better, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (adjusting his VISOR)<br>
    Not too bad, sir. A lot of<br>
    charged-particle precipitation,<br>
    but I can compensate.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Communicators are dysfunctional.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tricorders?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Readings only valid within five<br>
    meters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: his tricorder)<br>
    I'm not so sure of that... I'm<br>
    reading Worf as an unintelligent<br>
    life form.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/15/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf shoots Geordi a look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good thing we didn't bring<br>
    Data... we would've been<br>
    unscrambling his circuits for a<br>
    week...</p>
  <p> As they move from the beam down position... Geordi<br>
    reacts to something he sees...</p>
  <p>6. GEORDI'S VISOR POV - (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> picking up objects that have a different molecular<br>
    reading than the ground cover...</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    Picking up something on the<br>
    positron scan, Commander.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. GALORNDON SURFACE</p>
  <p> Geordi takes the point...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Over here. Some electrically<br>
    conductive objects.</p>
  <p> Moving with them as they begin to encounter pieces of<br>
    wreckage from a small landing craft, badly destroyed...<br>
    Riker looks down at some, reacts as he sees familiar<br>
    markings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Recognize the markings, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yessir. Romulan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wonder what the hell they were<br>
    doing in a Federation sector.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm picking up traces of ultritium<br>
    residue with my VISOR, Commander.<br>
    An explosive device must've been<br>
    used to destroy the craft after<br>
    it crashed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They exchange a look. That means survivors. They draw<br>
    phasers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Spread out... twenty five meter<br>
    radius... our window back closes<br>
    in nine minutes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/12/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They spread out. Moving with Geordi as he continues to<br>
    follow --</p>
  <p>8 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the distance between them increases, there is no<br>
    longer visual contact... Geordi disappears into the<br>
    storm as Worf comes across a seriously hurt Romulan<br>
    (PATAHK).</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> Riker is not visible... likely out of earshot in the<br>
    wind... Worf bends down, rolls the Romulan on his back.<br>
    Patahk is MOANING, delirious.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander Riker...</p>
  <p> Patahk opens his eyes and sees Worf. He lunges up from<br>
    the ground, and tries to close his hands around Worf's<br>
    throat. Worf struggles with the Romulan and succeeds<br>
    easily in immobilizing the injured man. A moment<br>
    later, Riker appears, reacts to the sight of the<br>
    Romulan.</p>
  <p>9 WITH GEORDI</p>
  <p> moving along the terrain... suddenly without warning,<br>
    the earth beneath him collapses and...</p>
  <p>10 INT. PIT</p>
  <p> Geordi falls hard to the ground, splashing in muddy<br>
    water... his VISOR is flung from his face on impact...<br>
    he groans, stunned... reaches out, trying to find the<br>
    VISOR in the puddle, finally touches it... puts it<br>
    on... wipes it off... sees that he's in a deep<br>
    pit...</p>
  <p> NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> The sky raging in a small opening many feet<br>
    overhead... The walls are slick and muddy -- not<br>
    rocky... there's no way back up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/13/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (yelling)<br>
    COMMANDER RIKER... WORF... HEY<br>
    UP THERE...</p>
  <p>12 RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> can't hear him. They are supporting the Romulan...<br>
    moving him back to the beam-out spot.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Four minutes to beam-up, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker tries to see through the storm... it's<br>
    impossible...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where is he? Wait here...</p>
  <p> He moves into the storm, quickly disappearing...</p>
  <p>13 GEORDI</p>
  <p> trying his communicator, knowing it doesn't work...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    La Forge to Riker... La Forge to<br>
    Worf...<br>
    (yelling up again)<br>
    HEY...</p>
  <p> He tries to climb... the walls are wet and slippery...<br>
    he only succeeds in bringing more mud sliding down on<br>
    top of him...</p>
  <p>14 RIKER</p>
  <p> moving through the storm... it's getting worse...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    GEORDI...</p>
  <p>15 WORF AND PATAHK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf kneeling on one leg... the Romulan is barely<br>
    clinging to consciousness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - 9/11/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf, knowing time is running out, looks out into the<br>
    fog... sees Riker returning alone... they exchange<br>
    a look that says Geordi's lost. With a burst of<br>
    determination, Worf rises and starts to move away into<br>
    the storm to find Geordi...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, maintain your<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> Worf reluctantly obeys. A moment later all three<br>
    DEMATERIALIZE. HOLD on the wind-swept wasteland as the<br>
    fierce electrical storm takes hold.</p>
  <p>16 INT. CAVERN</p>
  <p> Geordi looks up and no longer bothers yelling. He<br>
    knows it's useless. As we push into his face...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/12/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In orbit around Galorndon Core, an electromagnetically<br>
    shrouded planet, obscured by fierce storms and wildly<br>
    erratic arcs of jagged electricity.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43349.2.<br>
    An unidentified distress signal<br>
    has led to the discovery of a<br>
    crashed Romulan vessel on the<br>
    surface of Galorndon Core, a<br>
    Federation planet.</p>
  <p>17 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Much activity... the Romulan being examined by<br>
    BEVERLY... MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES arriving with a<br>
    gurney...</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We have recovered one survivor.<br>
    Lieutenant Commander La Forge<br>
    did not report back with the away<br>
    team and is still missing on the<br>
    surface.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Get him to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Worf observes... ordering SECURITY GUARDS to follow<br>
    --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Secure Sickbay. Post guards in<br>
    visual contact at all times.</p>
  <p> Reacting, on the move --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He's not going anywhere,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't waver, nods to the security personnel to<br>
    follow the medical team... as they do, they pass PICARD<br>
    who arrives... moves to Riker who is with O'BRIEN at<br>
    his console...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/12/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien trying in vain to find some trace of Geordi<br>
    in the transporter scan.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'm sorry, Commander... There's<br>
    just no way to lock in on anything<br>
    down there...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (controlled)<br>
    Keep trying, Mister O'Brien.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (shakes his head,<br>
    useless)<br>
    The electrical storms are creating<br>
    thousands of ghosts...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sharp)<br>
    Then beam some of the ghosts up<br>
    here... one of them may be La<br>
    Forge.<br>
    (sees Picard)<br>
    Request permission to lead another<br>
    away team...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Denied.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    When we get another window in the<br>
    storms.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges, collects himself.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The crash site?</p>
  <p> Moving out into...</p>
  <p>18. INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Walking...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Romulan craft's a total loss.<br>
    There's nothing there to salvage<br>
    -- unless we do it with tweezers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/15/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No sign of others...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    We could barely see two meters<br>
    in front of us down there...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It certainly is the last place<br>
    one would expect a Romulan<br>
    encroachment.<br>
    (speculating)<br>
    On the other hand, Galorndon Core<br>
    would provide ideal cover for an<br>
    opening move of a new offensive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (agrees)<br>
    I doubt they were there for the<br>
    climate.</p>
  <p>19 EXT. GALORNDON SURFACE</p>
  <p> Emphasizing his point... the storm is continuing to<br>
    build.</p>
  <p>20 INT. PIT</p>
  <p> Geordi is closely examining the muddy walls around<br>
    him...</p>
  <p>21 HIS VISOR/POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> His scan reveals a substance buried in the wall that<br>
    has a different quality to it than the surrounding<br>
    soil...</p>
  <p>22 INT. PIT</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, burrows the mud away to reveal --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/15/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>23 INSERT - A SILVER ORE-LIKE SUBSTANCE</p>
  <p>24 INT. PIT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi examines it... begins to pull more dirt off the<br>
    wall, giving himself something of a work-table...<br>
    using the mud to shape a rough mold... he takes small<br>
    bits of ore out of the vein, puts them into his mold,<br>
    uses his phaser to melt them... steam erupts as it<br>
    turns into hot liquid in the cold mud... and as it<br>
    collects in the mold, we can see he is creating a<br>
    short, sharp pole...</p>
  <p>25 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is with Picard and Riker... as they observe<br>
    life-saving measures being taken with the Romulan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We thought it would be like<br>
    working on a Vulcan, but there<br>
    are subtle differences... too many<br>
    of them...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you treat him?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He has cell damage in vital<br>
    areas... He's going to need a<br>
    transfusion of compatible<br>
    ribosomes in order to recover.<br>
    I'm setting up a schedule to<br>
    test every member of the crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will he survive?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't answer that yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me put it another way -- will<br>
    he survive long enough to tell<br>
    us what he was doing here?</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is an important consideration,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can't put his life in any<br>
    additional jeopardy...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/15/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nor would we ask you to.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I can bring him around for a few<br>
    minutes...</p>
  <p> As she prepares an injection...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There is one serious complication.<br>
    His brainwaves indicate early<br>
    neural-pathway degeneration.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A head injury?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shakes her head, no)<br>
    There was no obvious cranial<br>
    trauma. I'm guessing the exposure<br>
    to the magnetic fields on the<br>
    surface was slowly breaking down<br>
    his synaptic connections.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Will it affect Geordi the same<br>
    way?</p>
  <p> She nods, concerned... Gives the injection to Patahk<br>
    who stirs. As he awakens, Picard observes as Riker<br>
    moves closer to the Romulan. Patahk is in clear<br>
    discomfort.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You are aboard the Federation<br>
    Starship Enterprise.<br>
    (Patahk reacts)<br>
    We are treating your injuries.<br>
    How long were you on Galorndon<br>
    Core?<br>
    (he does not answer)<br>
    Do you understand me?</p>
  <p> PATAHK<br>
    I will not answer questions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We must know if there are any<br>
    other survivors on the surface.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/12/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PATAHK<br>
    I am alone. I will not answer<br>
    any questions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there a mother ship we should<br>
    advise of your condition?</p>
  <p> The Romulan closes his eyes and drifts back into<br>
    unconsciousness. Beverly signals that's it... Riker<br>
    joins Picard who has heard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The only answer he offers is that<br>
    he was alone...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... which suggests he wasn't.</p>
  <p>26 INT. PIT - GEORDI'S FACE STRAINING</p>
  <p> and then...</p>
  <p>27 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> to see he is halfway up the side of the pit... using<br>
    two of his &quot;spike&quot; tools in each hand to poke into the<br>
    earth, pulling himself up, inch by inch... the howling<br>
    of the wind above... crashing thunder... flickering of<br>
    lightning...</p>
  <p>28 HIS FEET</p>
  <p> are almost useless, slipping on the sides...</p>
  <p>29 INT. PIT - GEORDI</p>
  <p> as he grits his teeth and raises himself another notch<br>
    and...</p>
  <p>30 EXT. GALORNDON SURFACE</p>
  <p> Geordi's arm reaches over and drives a stake in the<br>
    ground... pulls himself up and out, exhausted...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/13/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>31 OMITTED</p>
  <p>32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, Beverly, TROI, WESLEY and DATA.<br>
    Picking up in mid-conversation...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something that can cut through<br>
    the storm... to give us some way<br>
    to signal him...</p>
  <p> Wesley has an idea...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A neutrino pulse...</p>
  <p> They turn to him...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We could build a portable neutrino<br>
    source and send it in a probe to<br>
    the surface. It would be like<br>

  <p> Picard glances at Data for a reaction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A neutrino pulse would send<br>
    non-charged particles back up<br>

    would be detectable by Geordi's<br>
    VISOR.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He'll be able to show us that he's<br>
    found it by modifying the<br>

  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Captain Picard, my apologies.<br>
    If I had known you were in this<br>

    advised you before crossing the<br>

  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    I'm sure you'll understand when<br>
    I explain. Simply, one of our<br>
    ships had a slight navigational<br>
    error and apparently crashed on<br>
    Galorndon Core.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, we have recovered one<br>

  <p> TOMALAK<br>

    May I speak to him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is not conscious... and not<br>
    well enough to leave Sickbay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, with your permission...</p>
  <p> Picard nods. She looks to the viewscreen --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I am Doctor Crusher, the medical<br>
    officer. We are doing everything<br>
    we can for him and it still may<br>
    not be enough. Any medical<br>
    guidance your ship's doctor can<br>
    offer...</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    (patronizing)<br>
    My dear, there is no way to talk<br>
    you through the intricacies of<br>
    Romulan medicine. His life is in<br>
    your hands.</p>
  <p> And it is clear that Tomalak is using this<br>
    &quot;responsibility&quot; as a diplomatic weapon.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I assume that you are prepared<br>
    to leave at once and rendezvous<br>
    with me in the Neutral Zone.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have an away team on the<br>

    window in the storm to beam them<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> Tomalak considers that...</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    And then you will return my<br>
    officer?</p>
  <p> Picard is not yet prepared to discuss that issue.<br>
    Instead...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are there any other Romulans we<br>
    should be looking to recover from<br>
    Galorndon Core... ?</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    No. It was a one-man craft.<br>
    (beat, cool)<br>
    Captain, we will be at the<br>
    Federation border of the Neutral<br>
    Zone in roughly five hours. We<br>
    will expect you to rendezvous at<br>
    that time.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I see no reason to return<br>

    We do have a right to detain him,<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Without clear evidence of intent,<br>
    it would not be a simple matter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (disagreeing)<br>
    This was obviously not pilot's<br>
    error, Captain... it requires a<br>
    response from us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    We must measure the response<br>
    carefully, Number One. Or history<br>

  <p> He tries it again, comes down wrong again. Geordi<br>
    removes his VISOR, presses a tiny button on the inside<br>

    shrugs, puts it back on. As he tries again, this time<br>
    he methodically adjusts...</p>

  <p> BOCHRA is standing a few meters away, holding Geordi's<br>
    tricorder and insignia in one hand -- and training a<br>
    phaser on him with the other. The wind grows more<br>
    furious. The Romulan does not look entirely well.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    You are my prisoner.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks at him -- big deal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right. Congratulations.<br>

    (beat)<br>
    And difficult to offer to a man<br>
    whose feelings run so deep.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Even if it means the life of the<br>
    Romulan?</p>
  <p> Picard's expression is pained. He is torn by his<br>
    respect for this woman, his need to respect Worf's<br>
    beliefs, his own personal feelings. Slowly,<br>
    regretfully, he shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must respect his personal<br>
    views... even if I do not share<br>
    them. He will have to live with<br>
    the consequences of his decision.</p>

  <p>57 INT. GALORNDON CAVE</p>
  <p> Bochra and Geordi sit facing one another. Bochra's<br>
    posture is ramrod-straight as he keeps his phaser<br>
    levelled at Geordi. But he seems oddly overheated for<br>
    the cold environment. Geordi, however, has made<br>
    himself as comfortable as possible, reclining and<br>
    putting his feet up -- a small show of rebellion.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wish you'd put that away.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    (smug)<br>
    You're afraid of dying.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (&quot;are you stupid?&quot;)<br>
    You bet I am. Who isn't?</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    I'm not.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    To die in the service of my<br>
    people...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ah, the Romulan path to glory.</p>
  <p> Such irreverence. Bochra starts to boil, then gets<br>
    control of himself. No sense letting a lowly human get<br>
    your goat.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    You can be sarcastic -- now. But<br>
    in a few millennia, when humans<br>
    are extinct and the Romulan Empire<br>
    spans the galaxy...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (genuinely curious)<br>
    You really believe that stuff,<br>
    don't you, Commodore?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/14/89 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Our culture is far older and wiser<br>
    than yours. It's inevitable that<br>
    we will prevail.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, if you're that sure of<br>
    yourselves, why be so<br>
    tight-lipped? You won't even tell<br>
    me your name.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    I see no need to tell you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why? Is it a military secret or<br>
    something? I've told you mine.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Okay, Commodore... whatever you<br>
    say.</p>
  <p> Bochra bristles. Geordi pretends not to notice.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    You may address me as Centurion<br>
    Bochra.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ahh. Bochra. Good, solid Romulan<br>
    name. And you're a centurion.<br>
    Well, stay with it, you'll be a<br>
    commodore someday.</p>
  <p> Bochra starts to react, realizes Geordi's deliberately<br>
    trying to get a rise out of him, decides two can play<br>
    at this game. Unruffled, Bochra replies:</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    I'm not certain of the equivalent<br>
    Federation rank... but I do know<br>
    it's higher than lieutenant<br>
    commander.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't help a grin. Good shot. Bochra's head<br>
    weaves momentarily as though he's dizzy.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's the matter?</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Nothing.</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wrong. Your heart rate just shot<br>
    way up.</p>
  <p> Bochra can't help his curiosity, looks at Geordi --<br>
    How can you tell? Geordi taps his VISOR in response.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It translates a wide range of<br>
    radiation into neural impulses.<br>
    Allows me to see.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Without it, you are blind?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    How did this happen?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I was born that way.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    (honestly doesn't<br>
    understand)<br>
    And your parents let you live?</p>
  <p> Geordi's stunned.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What kind of question is that?<br>
    Of course they let me live.</p>
  <p> Bochra shakes his head. Humans are strange.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    No wonder your race is weak. You<br>
    waste time and resources on<br>
    defective children...</p>
  <p> That pushes Geordi's button.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Defective? Listen, Commodore --<br>
    I'm a chief engineer in Starfleet.<br>
    You don't get there by being<br>
    defective.</p>

  <p> He sees the neutrino beam through the storm... but<br>
    suddenly the vision goes haywire.</p>

  <p> reacts...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Whoa...</p>
  <p> Bochra looks on with fascination as Geordi removes his<br>
    VISOR and presses the tiny button inside. The VISOR<br>
    BEEPS back.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Bochra)<br>
    I'm having some sort of polarity<br>
    shift. The diagnostic insists<br>
    everything's fine...</p>
  <p> Geordi replaces his VISOR over his eyes, looks at<br>
    Bochra with concern.</p>

    Your body temperature's gone up<br>
    another full degree...</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    (giving nothing away)<br>
    What are you saying?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's this place... All that<br>
    electromagnetic soup is playing<br>
    hell with our nervous systems.<br>
    Your metabolism's messed up...<br>
    so's my interface with the VISOR.</p>

    freezes.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Sit down.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bochra...</p>
  <p> Bochra wavers. He's feeling dizzy, short of breath,<br>
    feverish -- but is trying not to let it show. Maybe<br>
    Geordi's telling the truth -- but Bochra can't bring<br>
    himself to trust him.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>

    Sit down.</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Geordi sits down...</p>

  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, Wesley, Data. Wesley is<br>
    monitoring the neutrino probe... a concerned look on<br>
    his face. Riker, impatient for a sign, glances over<br>
    Wes' shoulder, sighs... a shiver in the signal makes<br>
    him react... he looks at Wesley who shakes his head...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Just a background fluctuation,<br>

  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Picard, I'm approaching the<br>
    Federation border and the<br>
    Enterprise is not to be found.<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't like Tomalak's attitude, but he<br>
    maintains his composure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My away team has not been able<br>
    to leave the surface because of<br>
    the storms.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    And my officer?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is alive.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    His life remains in jeopardy?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Include Worf.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    And yet you will still not permit<br>
    me to cross into your precious<br>
    Federation space to retrieve<br>
    him...</p>
  <p> Picard feels himself being manuevered into a defensive<br>
    position. He knows he's escalating the stakes when<br>
    he responds...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the point hasn't been made<br>
    clearly, Commander, let me make<br>
    it again.<br>

    But a mission of mercy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A mission to recover one of your<br>
    officers who was caught on a<br>
    Federation planet. For reasons<br>
    still unknown...</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    I have already explained that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I have rejected your<br>
    explanation.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    Territories... you would measure<br>
    territories against a man's life?</p>
  <p> Picard does not at all like being in this position. He<br>
    takes the only posture he can.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, your singular concern<br>
    for a life is impressive. Do<br>
    not risk any more lives by leaving<br>
    the Neutral Zone. Picard out.</p>
  <p> The screen returns to starfield. Picard is really<br>
    furious with the way this is going. He turns and<br>
    cannot help exchanging a glance with Worf. As he EXITS<br>

  <p> The SOUND of the storm outside has abated. Bochra's<br>
    definitely not a well Romulan; he's sweating, and his<br>
    hands have developed a slight tremble. He is clearly<br>
    much further along in his deterioration than Geordi.<br>
    But he never takes his eyes -- or the phaser -- off<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bochra, you're in bad shape.</p>
  <p> Bochra doesn't respond.</p>

    My vision's getting worse.<br>
    There's a beacon out there...<br>
    it'll get us back to my ship...<br>

  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    I can't surrender to the<br>

  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    If the situation were reversed...<br>
    would you not die to avoid<br>
    capture?</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a beat to consider.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know. I might... if I<br>
    thought it was necessary. If the<br>
    stakes were high enough.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But they'd have to be pretty damn<br>
    high.</p>
  <p> Bochra thinks this over. Maybe he's considering just<br>
    how high -- or low -- the stakes are in his case.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Guess I'd make a pretty lousy<br>
    Romulan, huh... ?</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    I no more wish to die than you<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (a smile)<br>
    You mean Romulans aren't always<br>
    ready to sacrifice themselves on<br>
    command?</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    No more than humans are frail,<br>
    weak-willed children without any<br>
    conception of loyalty or duty.</p>
  <p> They exchange a weak grin. Geordi tests his vision;<br>
    it's getting worse.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bochra -- there are times when<br>
    dying for one's ideals is<br>
    necessary.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Do you believe this is one of<br>
    those times?</p>
  <p> Bochra agonizes, makes up his mind, gets to his feet<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Lieutenant, his life is coming<br>

    hand and takes Worf by the wrist, tries to speak, pull<br>
    himself up, cannot... Worf leans over to hear what he has<br>
    to say.</p>

  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Do all humans give up so easily?</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles in return.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are all Romulans so pushy?<br>
    Bochra, we're lost... unless<br>
    you've got something that can<br>
    smell neutrinos.</p>
  <p> Bochra picks up Geordi's tricorder.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    We have the sensor device you were<br>
    carrying.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My tricorder? It isn't set up<br>
    to detect neutrinos.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    But your eye device does. Connect<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's crazy. They don't speak<br>
    the same language. I'd never get<br>
    an accurate sampling...<br>
    (stops; maybe it's not<br>
    so crazy)<br>
    But, then, I don't need an<br>
    accurate sampling. I just need<br>
    a pointer... a neutrino Geiger<br>
    counter.</p>
  <p> Geordi considers the problem, then sinks back into<br>
    dejection.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Still not possible.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    You cannot do it?</p>

  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    Ready.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Bochra pans the area with the unit. As he scans, the<br>

  <p> Worf nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Romulan ship will reach us<br>
    within the hour, Lieutenant. If<br>
    our patient dies... it may be<br>
    just the excuse the Romulan<br>
    commander needs to start an<br>
    incident. The death of a Romulan<br>
    officer at the hands of the<br>

  <p> Picard chooses his next words carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sometimes the moral obligations<br>
    of command are less than clear.<br>
    I weigh the good of the many<br>
    against the needs of the<br>

    You wouldn't complain even if you<br>
    had cause, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If you order me to agree to the<br>
    transfusion, I will, of course,<br>

  <p> Picard turns to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I cannot order you. I will not<br>
    order you, Lieutenant. But I ask<br>
    you. I beg you to volunteer.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    You have entered Federation space<br>

    No acknowledgement, Captain.</p>
  <p> Slow push to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, both our ships are<br>

    supremely powerful, destructive<br>
    arsenals at our command. Our next<br>
    actions will have serious<br>
    repercussions for both sides.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We have good reason to mistrust<br>
    one another, Commander, but we<br>
    have better reasons to set our<br>
    differences aside. The question,<br>
    of course, is who will show<br>
    vulnerability first.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    The answer is -- I will. I must<br>
    lower my shields to transport<br>
    these men off the planet surface.</p>
  <p> Picard crosses and stares at the warbird on the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once the shields are down, you<br>

    blast at any moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir. Energizing.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Bochra MATERIALIZE. (Note: Geordi's VISOR<br>
    is back on his face.) The sight of a Romulan on the<br>

  <p>83 ANGLE ON THE VIEWSCREEN - ROMULAN READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Sure enough, the view of the warbird is replaced with<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, how is it possible you<br>
    didn't know of this second<br>
    Romulan on Galorndon Core?</p>
  <p> Having been caught with his pants down, Tomalak reverts<br>
    to his earlier manner -- the unctuous commander worming<br>
    his way out of trouble.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    A simple misunderstanding, Captain<br>
    Picard. I was obviously<br>
    misinformed as to the size of the<br>
    craft. I assure you, I intended<br>
    no deception.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course not.</p>
  <p> TOMALAK<br>
    You doubt my good faith?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's just say my faith would be<br>
    strengthened with a gesture --<br>
    such as powering down your<br>
    disruptors.</p>
  <p> Tomalak nods, pushes a button. A moment later:</p>

  <p>86 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> O'Brien is behind the console. Beverly supervises two<br>
    CREWMEMBERS who are placing a coffin on the transporter<br>
    pad. Worf, Geordi, and Bochra ENTER. Bochra sees the<br>
    pallet, looks at Beverly. And she says this to Bochra,<br>
    but all the while gives Worf a scathing look:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It was not in my power to save<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> Perhaps a slight stress on the &quot;my&quot; for Worf's benefit.<br>
    Worf is stiffly silent as Beverly and the two<br>
    crewmembers EXIT.</p>
  <p>87 ON BOCHRA</p>
  <p> crossing to the transporter pad -- and his fallen<br>
    comrade.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    He was a loyal officer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Enemy&quot; - REV. 9/15/89 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Bochra somberly takes his place on the pad, nods in<br>
    salute and farewell to Geordi.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Lieutenant Commander La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (returns the nod)<br>
    Centurion Bochra.</p>
  <p> BOCHRA<br>
    You're not what I expected of a<br>
    Federation officer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's okay; you're not what I<br>
    expected of a Romulan, either.<br>
    (with a grin)<br>
    That's a compliment.</p>
  <p> Bochra manages a thin smile. Geordi nods a final<br>
    goodbye and...</p>
  <p>88 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi signals O'Brien, who energizes; Bochra and the<br>
    pallet DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>88A GEORDI AND O'BRIEN</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's the way to fight all the<br>
    wars from now on. Two guys on<br>
    a planet with no one else to talk<br>
    to and nowhere to go. Things get<br>
    settled in a hurry.</p>
  <p> Exiting with O'Brien past Worf...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (leaving)<br>
    I'm gonna sleep for four days...</p>
  <p> The doors hiss closed. Staying a beat on Worf as he<br>
    remains there a long beat, stands quietly, deadpanned...<br>
    and we can only speculate what he's thinking. He EXITS<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
