    &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. TEN-FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WORF is seated at a table near one of the windows. The<br>
    ship is traveling at WARP SPEED and the stars STREAK<br>
    by. GUINAN comes over to Worf's table and delivers<br>
    a drink to him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Try this.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (looks at drink with<br>
    suspicion)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Just try it.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a cautious sip, then reacts with pleasure.<br>
    He looks at her with surprise.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    It's an Earth drink... prune<br>
    juice.</p>
  <p> Worf takes another belt of this marvelous concoction<br>
    and nods with pleasure.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A warrior's drink.</p>
  <p> Guinan sits down at the table.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You're always drinking alone.<br>
    It wouldn't hurt you to look for<br>
    a little...<br>
    (glances at a YOUNG<br>
    COUPLE at nearby table)<br>
    ...companionship.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her with vague irritation. This<br>
    conversation is venturing into areas he'd rather avoid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (measured)<br>
    I would require a Klingon woman<br>
    for... companionship. Human<br>
    females are too fragile.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Not all of them... I know one or<br>
    two on board who might find you<br>
    a bit tame...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Impossible.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You never know until you try...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then I will never know.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Coward...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am merely concerned for the<br>
    safety of my crewmates.</p>
  <p> Guinan nods -- &quot;oh, right.&quot;</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Drink your prune juice.</p>
  <p> The view out the window abruptly changes as the ship<br>
    DROPS OUT OF WARP. The stars cease to streak by, and<br>
    far out in front of the ship, a RIFT can be seen in<br>
    space. The rift resembles a large jagged tear in space<br>
    within which can be seen a maelstrom of changing colors<br>
    and patterns.</p>
  <p>2 ON GUINAN AND WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who both react to the view and the rift. Worf is<br>
    already starting to rise when he hears...</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, report to the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (heading out)<br>
    On my way, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Guinan steps toward the window with a look of concern<br>
    on her face. She can sense something... confusion,<br>
    dread, possibly a trace of fear cross her face. Linger<br>
    on her expression then...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND RIFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship hangs before the gaping rift in space.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, TROI in Command, WESLEY at Con, DATA at<br>
    Ops. Worf ENTERS and goes to Tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Analysis, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors are reading gravimetric<br>
    fluctuations... most unusual<br>
    ones.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Unusual&quot; how? Specify?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing I have seen before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it a wormhole?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes... and no. Like a... time<br>
    displacement, but it does not have<br>
    a discernible event horizon.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir, navigational subsystems are<br>
    unable to give coordinates on the<br>
    object.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (checks console)<br>
    Confirmed. The phenomenon does<br>
    not have a definable center or<br>
    outer edge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you saying it is... and yet<br>
    it isn't there?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not have sufficient<br>
    information to make an analysis<br>
    as yet, Commander. The dynamics<br>
    of the radiation patterns---</p>
  <p>5 ON WORF</p>
  <p> He sees something on his tactical display and<br>
    interrupts Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Something's happening, Captain.<br>
    A new change in sensor readings.</p>
  <p>6 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Guinan is still looking out the window. Her puzzlement<br>
    turns to alarm.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (almost a whisper)<br>
    No...</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE RIFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The colors within the rift change, swirl, shift... a<br>
    SHIP suddenly appears. It is barely visible and no<br>
    identification of design or type is possible yet.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> His eyes fixed on the viewscreen... his voice<br>
    strangely echoing...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULL BACK to reveal the rest of the bridge except for<br>
    the Tactical station. (NOTE: history has just been<br>
    changed although none of our characters realize it)<br>
    The bridge has now been ALTERED to suggest a more<br>
    militaristic atmosphere. The mood is darker, more<br>
    somber... our comfortable bridge is more like the nerve<br>
    center of a battleship than of an explorer. Even our<br>
    uniforms have been slightly altered to emphasize rank<br>
    and status.</p>
  <p> Troi is gone. Wesley now wears a regular Ensign's<br>
    uniform... what were once science stations are now<br>
    damage control centers... SECURITY SUPERNUMERARIES<br>
    with sidearms are posted near all turbolifts...<br>
    Picard's chair is larger and more impressive... patches<br>
    and scars on the bulkheads attest to the action the<br>
    ship has seen recently. The attitudes of our<br>
    characters are more military and formal. These people<br>
    have been hardened slightly and are not the relaxed,<br>
    at ease people we've come to know.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you identify the ship,<br>
    Lieutenant? Is it an enemy<br>
    vessel?</p>
  <p> MOVE TO TACTICAL and now reveal TASHA at station. The<br>
    Tactical station itself has been expanded and enhanced<br>
    with more panels and displays. Tasha replies crisply<br>
    and efficiently... as if she had never been anywhere<br>
    else.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I'm getting too much interference,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p>8A EXT. SPACE - THE RIFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship within the rift is more clearly visible. It<br>
    is unmistakably a starship of an earlier design than<br>
    our own. It is very battered and beaten and looks as<br>
    though it's been to hell and back.</p>
  <p>8B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    It's clearing, Captain.<br>
    Definitely a Federation<br>
    starship... accessing registry...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - 12/8/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>8C ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The other ship, hereafter called Enterprise-C, can be<br>
    seen and the heavy damage is apparent.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Looks like they had a rough ride.</p>
  <p>8D NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (reading display with<br>
    surprise)<br>
    N, C, C, one-seven-oh-one... C.<br>
    U.S.S.... Enterprise.</p>
  <p> On reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE TWO ENTERPRISES (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Enterprise-C in f.g. with name and designation number<br>
    clearly visible. Enterprise-D in b.g.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Military log, Combat-date<br>
    43625.2. While investigating an<br>
    unusual radiation anomaly reported<br>
    by Starbase one oh five, the<br>
    Enterprise has encountered what<br>
    could almost be called a ghost<br>
    from its own past... The<br>
    Enterprise-C, the immediate<br>
    predecessor of this battleship.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors confirm design and<br>
    specifications, Captain. Analysis<br>
    of hull and engine materials<br>
    conform to engineering patterns<br>
    and methods of that time period.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But that cruiser was destroyed<br>
    with all hands about twenty years<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Presumed destroyed. The<br>
    Enterprise-C was last seen near<br>
    the Klingon outpost on Narendra<br>
    Three exactly twenty-two years,<br>
    four months and three days ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And now it's here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, is it possible...<br>
    that it has... traveled through<br>
    time?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Everyone's been thinking the same thing, but hearing it<br>
    actually said out loud makes them all take another look<br>
    at the ship sitting in front of them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility, Captain.<br>
    If that is the correct hypothesis,<br>
    then the phenomenon we just<br>
    enountered was a temporal rift<br>
    in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A rift?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibly the formation of a Kerr<br>
    loop from superstring material...<br>
    it would require high-energy<br>
    interactions occuring in the<br>
    vicinity for such a structure to<br>
    form. The rift is certainly not<br>
    stable, Captain. It could<br>
    collapse at any time.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    (eyes on tactical<br>
    display)<br>
    I'm able to scan the interior of<br>
    the ship now, sir... heavy damage<br>
    to warp field nacelles and hull<br>
    bearing struts... internal space<br>
    frame --<br>
    (shock at new reading)<br>
    Life-signs, Captain!</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker react.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Readings are sporadic... looks<br>
    like they have massive casualties,<br>
    but some are still alive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to Sickbay. Emergency<br>
    teams, stand by Transporter Rooms.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Riker a look:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Belay that order, Doctor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I respectfully suggest that<br>
    regardless of how they did it,<br>
    they are here now and they need<br>
    our help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That ship has traveled into its<br>
    own future. We are dealing with<br>
    variables that could alter the<br>
    flow of our own history.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But their influence on history<br>
    has ended, sir. That ship<br>
    disappeared from the past<br>
    twenty-two years ago and never<br>
    returned.</p>
  <p> Before Picard can reply, Tasha interrupts them.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, the Enterprise... C is<br>
    sending out a distress call, sir.<br>
    Audio only.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> GARRETT'S COM VOICE<br>
    (strained as if in pain)<br>
    This... is Captain Garrett... of<br>
    the Starship Enterprise, to any<br>
    Federation ship. We... have been<br>
    attacked by Romulan warships and<br>
    require... immediate assistance.<br>
    We have lost warp drive...<br>
    life-support is failing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have no record of a Romulan<br>
    assault on the Enterprise-C...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Voice message has ended, Captain.<br>
    All I'm receiving now is their<br>
    automated distress signal.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to Picard. He looks at the Main Viewer<br>
    as he makes his decision... a long tense moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hailing frequency, Lieutenant.<br>
    This is Captain Picard of... a<br>
    Federation starship. Standby to<br>
    receive emergency teams.</p>
  <p> The only response is STATIC.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We'll handle this one step at a<br>
    time. Stabilize power systems<br>
    and attend to their casualties.<br>
    Avoid discussions of where and<br>
    when they are.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (heads to turbolift)<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> SUPERNUMERARY goes to Tactical. Tasha and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (reading console)<br>
    Message coming in from Starfleet<br>
    monitor stations, Captain.<br>
    Klingon battlecruisers have been<br>
    reported moving toward this<br>
    sector.</p>
  <p> This is not welcome news.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grimly)<br>
    Battle alert, Mister Crusher.<br>
    Condition Yellow.</p>
  <p> bridge alert status goes to YELLOW and we hear a new<br>
    ALERT SOUND.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (works console)<br>
    All decks report Condition Yellow.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    12</p>
  <p>12A INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Which is somewhat different than we last saw it... no<br>
    civilians... about twenty UNIFORMED CREWMEN and WAITERS<br>
    all carrying sidearms. Not as casual... more a<br>
    military canteen/mess hall than a lounge.</p>
  <p> Guinan's expression is puzzled. She's walking around.<br>
    She frowns and shakes her head.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (to no one in<br>
    particular)<br>
    It's changed... it's all<br>
    changed...</p>
  <p> A customer overhears, gives her an odd look... she<br>
    moves quickly to EXIT.</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-C (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The battered starship drifts in space.</p>
  <p>14 INT. ENTERPRISE-C BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The bridge has been heavily damaged. RED ALERT is in<br>
    effect. FOUR SUPERNUMERARIES are lying dead on the<br>
    deck plates or at their consoles. Smoke lingers in<br>
    the air and burning panels add their own eerie<br>
    lighting. Slumped in the captain's chair is RACHEL<br>
    GARRETT, a tall, handsome woman that commands respect<br>
    instantly. She is injured and barely holding on to<br>
    consciousness. Riker, GEORDI, BEVERLY, and Tasha BEAM<br>
    onto the bridge. Beverly moves to a crewman lying on<br>
    the deck, Geordi goes to what's left of the engineering<br>
    console, and Riker and Tasha go to Garrett.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain Garrett?</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    (through fog of pain)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm Commander Riker. We have<br>
    emergency teams boarding your<br>
    ship.<br>

    We'll explain later, Captain.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    (summons some steel)<br>
    You'll explain now, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're from a Federation starship.<br>
    We've answered your distress call.<br>
    Your ship is in good hands, but<br>
    we need to get you to our Sickbay.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>

    goes over to Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shaking his head at<br>
    console)<br>
    Pretty bad, Commander. Looks like<br>
    they were in a hell of a fight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you can't stabilize<br>
    life-support, we'll have to<br>
    evacuate the ship.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we can do it. I'll have<br>
    to get to Engineering...</p>
  <p> Riker gives him a curt nod and Geordi moves toward<br>
    emergency exit.</p>

  <p> Geordi EXITS. A RASPING OF METAL is heard coming from<br>
    one of the collapsed bulkheads. Tasha moves quickly to<br>
    the wall and manages to move some of the material with<br>
    Riker's help.</p>
  <p>15 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> on Tasha and RICHARD CASTILLO, who is lying under the<br>
    rubble. Castillo is ruggedly handsome, with jet black<br>
    hair and fiery eyes. He is apparently just regaining<br>
    consciousness, but otherwise does not look injured.</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>
    Thanks...</p>
  <p> Castillo gets up, he's still a bit wobbly on his feet.<br>
    He looks at Tasha and Riker and tries to put his<br>
    memories in order. Riker wants to head off this<br>
    discussion for now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your Captain has been sent back<br>
    to the Ent--... back to our ship.<br>
    (glance around bridge)<br>
    You would appear to be the senior<br>
    officer left aboard.</p>
  <p> Castillo looks around the shattered bridge. The<br>
    destruction, though no surprise to him, is still<br>
    shocking. His gaze travels over the bodies of his<br>
    former shipmates.</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>

    So it would appear.</p>

  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Go ahead, Commander</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've stabilized life support,<br>
    Captain. Mister La Forge is<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd hate to scrap her, sir.<br>
    Starfleet could certainly use<br>
    another ship, even if it is a<br>
    little old.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - 12/8/89 - ACT ONE 15.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. But we can't stay in this<br>
    area too long.<br>
    (makes decision)<br>
    You have nine hours. If you can<br>
    get her underway in that time,<br>
    we'll escort her back to Starbase<br>
    one oh five. If not, we'll<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep me posted, Picard out.</p>
  <p> Picard turns away from the viewscreen and sees Guinan<br>

    somewhat unprecedented and Picard is very surprised.</p>

    You must have some idea how things<br>
    have changed...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I look at things... at people...<br>
    and they don't feel right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What things? What people?</p>
  <p> Guinan looks around helplessly for an example, settles<br>
    on Picard himself:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    The bridge...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the matter with it?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's not right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's the same bridge, Guinan. It<br>
    hasn't changed.</p>
  <p> Worried, confused -- she sits. Knowing but being<br>
    unable to explain... her placid nature cannot mask her<br>
    frustration... it's more frightening than anything<br>
    she's ever known.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know that. And I also know...<br>
    it's wrong.</p>

  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (quick)<br>
    No, we're not.<br>
    (beat, thoughtful)<br>
    I mean, we shouldn't be. This<br>
    is a ship of peace. Not of war.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Guinan, what you're suggesting...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's not a suggestion, Captain.<br>
    And that ship from the past...<br>
    it was not supposed to come here.<br>
    It's got to go back.</p>
  <p> On his reaction...</p>

  <p> Garrett is lying on a table while Beverly and a MEDICAL<br>
    SUPERNUMERARY work on her. In b.g., TWO MORE<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES tend to FOUR INJURED ENTERPRISE-C<br>
    CREWMEMBERS. Garrett is awakening, looks around the<br>
    Sickbay. She's beginning to realize that this isn't<br>
    just another starship. She looks at the instruments<br>
    that Beverly is using with curiosity... they don't seem<br>
    quite familiar to her. She looks over as Picard<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Garrett)<br>
    I'm Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    (tries to sit up)<br>
    Rachel Garrett. How's my ship?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life support systems have been<br>

  <p> GARRETT<br>
    Where did you come from? We<br>

  <p> Picard and Beverly exchange a glance...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (avoiding her question)<br>
    What is the last thing you<br>
    remember?</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    We were answering the distress<br>
    signal...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Distress signal... ?</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    You must have heard it. From the<br>
    Klingon outpost, Narendra Three.<br>
    (off his look)<br>
    But you didn't... did you?</p>
  <p> Garrett looks around the Sickbay again.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    I've never seen a Sickbay like<br>
    this... not even on a starbase.<br>
    And your uniforms...<br>
    (firmly)<br>
    What ship is this, Captain?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Please... try to keep still...</p>
  <p> Picard struggles with the decision for a moment.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    I insist on an answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are aboard the Enterprise,<br>
    Captain... one-seven-oh-one-D.</p>
  <p> He lets that sink in for a second. Garrett grasps the<br>
    implication after a moment and her expression is<br>
    shocked. Picard nods...</p>

    Twenty-two years.</p>
  <p> It's a difficult realization for even a starship<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    Does my crew know yet?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No.</p>

    that, Picard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    they're informed...</p>
  <p> Garrett is puzzled by Picard's reticence.</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    Is there a reason they should not<br>

    I am concerned that if you return<br>
    to your own time with knowledge<br>
    of the future...</p>
  <p> GARRETT<br>
    Return? To the battle? We barely<br>
    escaped with our lives. If we<br>

    Guinan's feelings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    there was a bright light and<br>
    then... here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> alone at the far end of the table filled with wartime<br>
    displays and charts... they look at each other a beat.<br>
    Picard is quite tense, a man who needs answers to make<br>
    a difficult judgment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need more.</p>
  <p> Guinan looks at him. She can't help him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    There is no more. I wish there<br>
    was, Captain. I wish I could<br>
    prove it. I can't.</p>

    Not good enough.<br>

    Not good enough. I will not ask<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I cannot justify readjusting<br>
    history on the basis of saving<br>
    lives in war... shall I return<br>
    to Sarajevo and stop the<br>
    assassination of Archduke<br>
    Ferdinand... or go back to warn<br>
    Station-Salem Four of the Bel-zon<br>

    They must return to their own<br>

    by going back they will<br>

    it is very possible she is correct.<br>
    A ship from the past has traveled<br>

    know what effect that event has<br>
    had on the present. Indeed, we<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Sir, Lieutenant Castillo is the<br>

    will have limited support from<br>
    Ops, no Tactical, reduced staff<br>
    in Engineering...</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    But certainly, history never meant<br>
    this ship to be led into battle<br>
    without your captain.</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>
    I can't speak to that point,<br>
    sir... but I can get us back to<br>

    Sir, it is my intention to return,<br>
    unless you order me not to.</p>
  <p> Picard's eyes glow with admiration for the young<br>
    lieutenant... Tasha watches with renewed concern, but<br>
    she too respects him enormously.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How soon will your ship be ready?</p>
  <p> CASTILLO<br>
    We sustained moderate damage in<br>

    I've seen it in your eyes, Guinan.<br>
    We've known each other too long...</p>

    (beat)<br>
    We weren't meant to know each<br>
    other at all.<br>

    Or that's what I sense when I look<br>
    at you.</p>
  <p> Tasha looks at her with a curious smile...</p>

    You're not supposed to be here,<br>
    Tasha.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Where am I supposed to be?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Dead.</p>
  <p> Tasha is shaken as any of us would be... she tries to<br>
    cover it. A beat.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Do you know how?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Captain, I request a transfer to<br>
    the Enterprise-C.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken by surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For what reason?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    They need someone at Tactical.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're needed here.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Sir, I don't belong here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Sit down.<br>
    (she does)<br>
    What did she tell you?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I'm not supposed to be here. I'm<br>
    not supposed to be alive.</p>
  <p> Picard is shaken by the revelation...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rather aghast)<br>
    She felt it was necessary to<br>
    disclose this to you?</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I felt it was necessary.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - 12/10/89 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You realize that it is very<br>
    possible that the Enterprise-C<br>
    could fail. We may be forced to<br>
    remain in this time line... in<br>
    which case your life would go on,<br>
    hopefully for a long while.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    I know how important it is that<br>
    they don't fail, Captain. That's<br>
    why I'm requesting this transfer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, you don't belong on<br>
    that ship...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    No. Captain Garrett belongs on<br>
    that ship. But now that<br>
    she's dead, there's a certain<br>
    logic in this request.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's no logic in it at all.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Tasha, whether they succeed or<br>
    not, the Enterprise-C will be<br>
    destroyed...</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    At least, with a tactical officer<br>
    on board, they will have a chance<br>
    to defend themselves well,<br>
    Captain... it may be a matter of<br>
    seconds or minutes... but those<br>
    could be the minutes that change<br>
    history...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Guinan says I died a senseless<br>
    death in the other time line.<br>
    I didn't like the sound of that,<br>
    sir. I've always known the risks<br>
    that come with a Starfleet<br>
    uniform. If I am to die in one,<br>
    I'd like my death to count for<br>
    something.</p>

    compensate for the damaged units<br>
    on the Enterprise-C.</p>
  <p> Picard stands, nods. Riker moves a couple of steps<br>
    closer, while Wes and Data turn to look at Tasha. An<br>
    awkward moment... too much to say... this is neither<br>
    the time nor the place. Picard clears his throat, but<br>
    before he can say anything there is a SOUND from the<br>

    The Klingons are flanking us...<br>

    Continual fire, all phasers.</p>

  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>84 INT. ENTERPRISE-D MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> The room is filled with smoke and crackling consoles.<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES, some wounded or dead are in b.g.<br>
    Geordi is trying to make his report through the<br>
    confusion and damage.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Engineer to bridge. Can't hold<br>
    the antimatter containment<br>
    fields... Initiating emergency<br>
    shutdown...</p>
  <p> TWO EXPLOSIONS go off in the Engine Core. An ALARM<br>
    sounds just as a CLOUD OF GAS starts to pour out of<br>
    the Engine Core. Geordi reacts with horror. (NOTE:<br>
    computer registers a &quot;force field failure&quot; and the<br>
    emergency isolation door descends to close off the<br>
    engine core.)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Coolant leak! bridge, we have<br>
    a coolant leak in the engine core!<br>
    I can't shut it down -- estimate<br>

  <p> Geordi is cut off in mid-sentence as the bridge is<br>
    ROCKED again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long until the Enterprise-C<br>
    enters the rift?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Fifty-two seconds.</p>

    (works console)<br>
    Controls not responding.</p>
  <p> A SHAKE as the ship is hit again. An EXPLOSION at<br>
    Tactical. Riker goes down. Picard's face is grim.<br>
    This is the end and he knows it. A Klingon voice is<br>
    heard on the com (possibly Worf).</p>
  <p> KLINGON COM VOICE<br>
    Federation ship Enterprise...<br>
    surrender and prepare to be<br>
    boarded!</p>
  <p> Picard looks defiantly at the ships on the viewer.<br>
    He goes to the Tactical station and works the controls<br>
    himself. He looks at the Klingons with steel in his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Like hell.</p>
  <p> Picard fires the phasers.</p>

  <p> The ship enters the rift and disappears.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>91 INT. ENTERPRISE-D MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Match shot on Picard as we last saw him. It is not<br>
    immediately apparent whether or not anything has<br>
    changed or if the battle is still raging.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Report, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p>92 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> which reveals the bridge of the Enterprise as seen in<br>
    the Teaser. Everyone is back at their normal stations.<br>
    The uniforms, the bridge itself and the people have<br>
    returned to normal. Worf is back at Tactical; Troi<br>
    is in her chair.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Readings fluctuated momentarily,<br>
    Captain. It appeared to be a<br>
    ship, but then it vanished.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this information in stride.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The rift is closing in on itself,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Prepare a class-one<br>
    sensor probe. We'll leave it<br>
    behind to monitor the final<br>
    closure. Mister Crusher, lay in<br>
    a course for Archer Four.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Yesterday's... &quot; - REV. 12/11/89 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Business as usual. As if nothing ever happened...<br>
    and to them it hasn't.</p>
  <p> GUINAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Guinan to Captain Picard... is<br>
    everything all right up there?</p>
  <p> Picard is a little puzzled by this unusual<br>
    communication from Guinan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Guinan?... Yes... everything's<br>
    fine. Is something wrong?</p>
  <p>93 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Guinan is behind the bar, holding a drink she's just<br>
    made.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    No, sir. Sorry to bother you.</p>
  <p> She looks around. Everything is right. A sad smile<br>
    crosses her features. She nods her head with<br>
    satisfaction. FOLLOW her as she moves down the bar<br>
    and hands the drink to Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, Guinan.</p>
  <p> Guinan nods, leans on the bar:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Geordi... tell me about Tasha<br>
    Yar.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
