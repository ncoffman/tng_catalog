  <p> Sitting.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The truth is I'm a career man...<br>
    you know, married to my job...<br>
    Mitzi doesn't understand that...<br>
    I like her a lot... but I just<br>
    don't think I'm ready for two<br>
    marriages if you know what I<br>
    mean...</p>
  <p>2 REVERSE OF TROI - TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> She's placid as usual, listening, or perhaps on<br>
    automatic pilot.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But at the same time, you know<br>
    I wouldn't want to lose her...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Maybe you should come in with her<br>
    and talk about it together.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Oh, I couldn't ask her to do<br>
    that...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sure you could. Why don't I make<br>
    another appointment for you...</p>
  <p> And as she calls up her schedule on a PADD.</p>

    She's being completely<br>

    party on Holodeck Four tonight...<br>
    and all the other kids are staying<br>
    overnight... well, most of them<br>
    and...</p>

  <p> In the background, MENDOZA, a Federation negotiator,<br>
    chats with several aliens including BHAVANI, the leader<br>
    of Barzan, and LEYOR, the Caldonian representative.<br>
    PICARD is smiling, jovial. A WAITER refills his<br>
    champagne glass and not for the first time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The pleasure of your company is<br>
    requested, Counselor. We're<br>
    having an impromptu reception for<br>
    the arriving delegates.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Captain, I'm not dressed for a<br>

    Just tell me there's some<br>
    chocolate here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, Counselor Troi... allow me<br>
    to do the introductions... Premier<br>
    Bhavani of the Barzan...</p>
  <p> Bhavani is a strong, no-nonsense, elderly woman; an<br>
    able judge of people. She wears a breathing device.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your discovery has certainly<br>
    produced a great deal of<br>
    excitement, Premier.</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    Hopefully, it will also produce<br>
    a new era of prosperity for my<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>
    We'll see to that...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know Mister Mendoza, the<br>
    Federation negotiator...</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>
    A pleasure to see you again,<br>
    Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> Mendoza is a middle-aged man with intelligent eyes and<br>
    confidence.</p>

    One of the Federation's worthy<br>
    competitors in the bidding, Leyor<br>
    of the Caldonians.</p>
  <p> LEYOR<br>
    Madame.</p>
  <p> The Caldonian is more reserved -- with a quietness that<br>
    comes more from academia than from shyness. Joining<br>
    them is DEVINONI RAL, a well-dressed, strikingly<br>
    attractive man with a disarming smile. On his arm is a<br>
    stunning woman, an accessory.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    And I am Devinoni Ral.</p>

  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    My traveling companion, Rojay.</p>
  <p> The woman, bored, barely acknowledges.</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>
    My good friend, Ral, is the best<br>
    hired gun in the business.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hired gun?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    My &quot;good friend&quot;, Mendoza means<br>
    that I am a negotiator who serves<br>
    a variety of clients... on this<br>
    occasion I represent the<br>
    Chrysalians.</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    I believe it's almost time, isn't<br>
    it Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed. It will be visible<br>
    directly ahead...</p>
  <p> The crowd moves to the windows...</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>
    Is it always on time, Bhavani?</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    Always. We see it every two<br>
    hundred and thirty-three<br>
    minutes... our scientists say it's<br>
    due to radiation buildup in the<br>
    acretion disk. The visible burst<br>
    is very brief..</p>
  <p> On her last line... the sky lights up with a dramatic<br>

    There it is, ladies and gentlemen.<br>
    The Barzan Wormhole. The first<br>
    and only stable wormhole known<br>
    to exist. It's yours... for the<br>
    right price.</p>
  <p> The group is overwhelmed at the spectacular sight<br>
    before their eyes... except as we see Troi, she senses<br>
    something else and as she turns, she sees Devinoni is<br>
    not looking at the wormhole, but at her. Her eyes meet<br>
    his... and he grins... and as the rest of the room sees<br>
    stars... they see only each other as we...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the Barzan planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 43385.7.<br>
    We are in orbit around Barzan,<br>
    a planet which is entertaining<br>
    bids for control of<br>
    what appears to be a most unique,<br>
    stable wormhole. It could<br>
    conceivably provide a permanent<br>
    shortcut within our galaxy.</p>
  <p>10 INT. OBSERVATION DECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, Bhavani, Mendoza, Leyor, Devinoni.<br>
    Bhavani is at the head of the table, addressing the<br>
    others...</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    And as you all know, the<br>
    environment on my planet is<br>
    completely inhospitable to most<br>
    other life forms. So I'd like<br>
    to express my appreciation to you,<br>
    Captain Picard, and your fine crew<br>
    for hosting these negotiations<br>
    aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    (Picard acknowledges)<br>
    Remember, Mister Mendoza, it<br>
    doesn't give the Federation an<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> Chuckles around the table. Mendoza acknowledges.<br>
    Devinoni studies his competition around the table.<br>
    He deliberately plays back throughout the scene. But<br>
    he's working.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Price&quot; - REV. 9/29/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    (getting serious)<br>
    The Barzan has been a society<br>
    dependent on others for<br>
    generations. We want that to end.<br>
    The appearance of this stable<br>
    wormhole in our space provides<br>
    us with our first true natural<br>
    resource. We have neither the<br>
    experience nor technology to<br>
    exploit it. You do.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, with some concern on his face...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excuse me, a delegation of...<br>
    Ferengi... wishes to be beamed<br>
    aboard...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were not expecting the<br>
    Ferengi, Premier... ?</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    No, but I do not wish to create<br>
    ill will, Captain. If they are<br>
    interested in bidding, I have no<br>
    objection.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks about saying he does... but realizes it's<br>
    not his place. Very well...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Chief O'Brien, this is Picard.<br>
    Beam the Ferengi directly to the<br>
    observation lounge.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, Captain...</p>
  <p> Three Ferengi MATERIALIZE near Riker. Their leader<br>
    is GOSS. The others are KOL AND ARRIDOR.</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    On behalf of all Ferengi, I<br>
    protest... why were we not invited<br>
    to these negotiations...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Price&quot; - REV. 9/25/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a glance with Picard...</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    My apologies. We did not<br>
    anticipate your interest. You<br>
    are welcome to join us.</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    I am DaiMon Goss. These are my<br>
    consuls... Kol and Doctor Arridor.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We'll need chairs...</p>
  <p> Standing... and this must all be a quick exchange --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    DaiMon, I am Captain Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard of the Enterprise... I'm<br>
    serving as host for these<br>
    proceedings...</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    Good, then see to it that we get<br>
    chairs at once.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (with an edge)<br>
    Perhaps you misunderstood...</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    Fine, fine, just have your Klingon<br>
    servant...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (pointed)<br>
    I am in charge of security.</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    Then who gets the chairs?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    DaiMon, due to the intimate nature<br>
    of these negotiations, all parties<br>
    agreed that one representative<br>
    would suffice. I will be happy<br>
    to provide your consuls with<br>
    accommodations... and you may have<br>
    my chair...</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    Very well. Kol, the bag...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Price&quot; - REV. 9/29/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Kol hands Goss a sack... Riker leads Kol and Arridor<br>
    out. They EXIT. Picard moves toward the door as<br>
    Goss exchanges places with him.</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    We can handle all the pleasantries<br>
    later. I'm sure I'll never<br>
    remember your names anyway, eh?<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Enough of this foolishness. Let's<br>
    get down to business.</p>
  <p> He turns the sack upside down and a pile of gold bars<br>
    spills out across the tabletop.</p>
  <p> GOSS<br>
    I'll match anyone's best offer...<br>
    and add the gold on top of it.</p>
  <p> He holds out his hands in a fait accomplit motion.<br>
    Sits back in his chair, with a confident grin. Bhavani<br>
    reacts, nonplussed. Picard EXITS...</p>
  <p>11 OUTSIDE THE DOOR - CLOSEUP</p>
  <p> a beat as the doors slide closed behind him and his<br>
    eyes look skyward with a my-God reaction...</p>
  <p>12 INT. TROI'S OFFICE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> She is studying personnel files of O'Brien and his<br>
    girlfriend... but her mind drifts for a moment and she<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    No... I... was just looking over<br>
    some personnel files...</p>

    Too bad. I had hoped you might<br>

  <p>19 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data and Mendoza are studying the<br>
    viewscreen where charts and graphs of the wormhole are<br>
    displayed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The data from the Barzan's probe<br>
    into the wormhole is impressive,<br>
    Captain. The wormhole delivered<br>
    the probe beyond the Denkiri Arm,<br>
    in the Gamma Quadrant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would take us nearly a century<br>
    at warp nine to cross that<br>
    distance...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The same distance could be<br>
    achieved in a matter of seconds<br>
    through the wormhole.</p>
  <p> Riker groans. Off their looks...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was just imagining the Ferengi<br>
    collecting tolls in front if we<br>
    lose to them...</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>
    I don't think the Ferengi are the<br>
    greatest threat at the table...<br>
    with all of DaiMon Goss' bluster,<br>
    they don't have the resources the<br>
    Barzans need.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd say that fellow Devinoni's<br>
    the one to watch out for...</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>

    is unheard of.</p>
  <p> MENDOZA<br>

    Are you saying this may not be<br>
    what it seems?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Barzans do not have manned<br>
    space travel, so they had to<br>
    resort to an automated probe.<br>
    Its findings are limited. It<br>
    cannot be determined from these<br>
    charts how stable the wormhole<br>
    really is or how long it will<br>
    remain intact.</p>

  <p>20 INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Goss and his aides, Kol and Arridor are huddled<br>
    together, up to no good. Arridor has a syringe and is<br>
    extracting from Goss's neck (with considerable pain to<br>
    Goss) some fluid.</p>
  <p> ARRIDOR<br>
    Just a moment of discomfort for<br>
    a good cause, DaiMon.</p>
  <p> Arridor takes his fluid and does some quick work with<br>
    it in a dish...</p>
  <p> ARRIDOR<br>
    You understand this will not be<br>

    Then, this will be just fine.</p>
  <p> He moves over and takes from his work a small (silver?)<br>
    drop of fluid and squeezes a drop on Goss's left<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I have an idea what the<br>
    rules are.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    That's what makes it so<br>
    interesting... the rules of the<br>
    game change to fit the moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    In that regard, it's not unlike<br>
    commanding a starship, Mister Ral.</p>
  <p> They nod to each other, formal adversaries.</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    Commander, Mister Mendoza has<br>
    already presented many of the<br>
    details of the Federation<br>
    proposal. Is there anything you<br>
    would like to add?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A complete analysis of our bid<br>
    is available on the ship's<br>
    computer for your consideration,<br>
    Premier... If I may summarize...</p>
  <p> Riker rises, goes to the viewscreen, calls up, a<br>
    complex graph showing the specifics of the proposal...<br>
    we don't need to see it in detail, but Riker will refer<br>
    to it for illustration...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our proposal includes technology<br>
    that will enhance your food<br>
    production, your mining<br>
    capabilities, and space travel.</p>

  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We offer scholars and scientists<br>
    to investigate the wormhole's<br>
    potential. And perhaps most<br>
    critical of all, we offer<br>
    Starfleet. The security of this<br>
    passage must never be compromised.<br>
    We offer protection of the<br>
    wormhole in perpetuity.</p>
  <p> Riker sits, feeling he's done pretty well for the first<br>
    time up. Devinoni stays seated... his eyes still on<br>
    Bhavani. Her eyes meet his...</p>
  <p> BHAVANI<br>
    Mister Ral... ?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (a beat, as though<br>
    reluctant)<br>
    Mister Riker's placed a great deal<br>
    of emphasis on defense... a<br>
    subject he obviously knows well,<br>
    having served Starfleet in many<br>
    a conflict.</p>
  <p> And Bhavani unconsciously barely nods... a tell...<br>
    Devinoni catches it... stands...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Chrysalians are enemies of no<br>
    one... and choose to remain that<br>
    way. Neutral.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Neutral. And uninvolved, sir,<br>
    in virtually all interstellar<br>
    matters of consequence.</p>
  <p> Devinoni moves over to Riker's chart on the viewscreen<br>
    as though to study it...</p>

  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    No one would claim that the<br>
    Chrysalians are as powerful as<br>
    the mighty Federation, but we have<br>
    resources and technology and<br>
    scientists too. We have also had<br>
    peace for ten generations.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts. Devinoni nods to him.</p>

  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    Mmmm?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI (O.S.)<br>
    Maybe I could stretch out these<br>

  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    Mmmm.</p>

    Would you like that?</p>
  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    (yes)<br>
    Mmm-hmmm.</p>
  <p> His hands continue to work... then her foot pulls away<br>
    and after a beat, Troi's face lies in the same spot...<br>
    (the camera can be locked)... his hands begin to<br>
    massage oil into her fingers... looking up off<br>

    What do your Betazoid senses tell<br>
    you about me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not very much...<br>

    My human physical response must<br>

  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Good.</p>

    It's never happened before.</p>

  <p> Mood breaker. She sits up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Who have you been talking to... ?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    No one. I just sensed something<br>
    when I saw the two of you<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (reinstates the mood)<br>
    Will Riker and I are good friends.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Uh huh...</p>
  <p> She sort of pushes him playfully down on the bed, he<br>
    rolls on his stomach and she climbs on his back...<br>
    begins to knead oil across his back...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It was once a little more than<br>
    that.</p>

    And how come we're talking about<br>
    me and not you?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Don't you have enough people<br>
    telling you about their lives?<br>
    Who counsels the counselor?</p>
  <p> She smiles, he has a point.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Uh uh, I want to know about you<br>
    now...</p>
  <p> He turns over. She's sitting on his lower chest.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I am a man of commerce. And I'm<br>
    what you see right now. No games,<br>
    no strategies. Just me, wanting<br>
    to run away with you.<br>
    (she reacts)<br>
    And knowing that if I asked you,<br>
    you'd never leave this damned<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> Yes she would... right now, in this moment, she<br>
    would... but she knows better than to trust the moment<br>
    and avoids responding.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When I first saw you, I felt as<br>
    if I'd been waiting for you. I've<br>
    been trying to understand why or<br>
    how that's possible.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Does it matter?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Price&quot; - REV. 9/25/89 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> She shakes her head, no.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    It will... when I tell you. But<br>
    you must promise never to tell<br>
    anyone else.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I am partly Betazoid too.<br>
    (she reacts)<br>
    My mother was half... I am one<br>

    You're empathic?</p>

    comfortable sensing emotions as<br>
    you seem to be...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's why you left Earth...</p>
  <p> He acknowledges.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I've learned to live with it, use<br>
    it... as you have... but still,<br>
    it isolates us, doesn't it... ?<br>
    (she acknowledges)<br>
    I thought it would always be that<br>
    way for me. Now, all of a sudden<br>
    the rules I live by don't mean<br>
    anything any more. I had tucked<br>
    my heart away... didn't need it,<br>
    didn't want it. At the<br>
    negotiating table it can be fatal<br>
    to have a heart... but I never<br>
    realized how much I missed it<br>

  <p> A romantic candlelight dinner alone. They are dressed<br>
    in nightclothes... he wears a robe, she is in her sexy<br>
    nightgown... there is a little tension from Troi...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Everyone's talking about the way<br>
    you absorbed the Caldonian bid<br>
    today...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    It was there for the taking...<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    So I took it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander Riker didn't know how<br>
    you managed it...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Let me tell you something, Will<br>
    Riker's good... the most dangerous<br>
    man in the room to me... he has<br>
    every instinct of a fine<br>
    negotiator...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... he just doesn't have an edge.<br>
    Your edge.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Our edge... and you make it sound<br>
    unethical.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Isn't it?</p>
  <p> Devinoni smiles, this is not a conversation he wants to<br>
    have.</p>

    Deanna, it's just business...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    Why haven't you told anyone that<br>
    you're an empath?</p>
  <p> Disturbed that she won't let it go.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I find it makes people<br>
    uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think you don't tell them...<br>
    so you can gain an advantage.</p>
  <p> Trying to joke it away --</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I used it to gain an advantage<br>
    with you... and you didn't mind...</p>
  <p> But she won't be had... she looks at him. He puts down<br>
    his fork. Okay, you want it? You got it --</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    The point of negotiating is to<br>
    take advantage, Deanna. I don't<br>
    know what the other side is<br>
    offering, they don't know what<br>
    I'm offering. We dance around<br>
    each other until someone wins.<br>
    I never cry foul when I lose.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But you're reading their emotional<br>
    states, their inner selves, then<br>
    using that to manipulate them.</p>
  <p> He becomes slightly impatient.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Deanna, people have been doing<br>
    that for thousands of years, by<br>
    listening carefully, by watching<br>
    body language. I just happen to<br>
    be better at it. You do it.</p>

    hide that I'm an empath.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    You announce it to every alien<br>
    culture you encounter? Or do you<br>
    use it to give your side an<br>
    advantage. Do you tell the<br>
    Romulan in the ship about to<br>
    attack that you can feel that<br>
    he's bluffing or do you just tell<br>
    it to your captain?</p>
  <p> Troi reacts, on the defensive...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's different. It's a matter<br>
    of protection...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Your protection... your captain,<br>
    your crew... your edge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Yes. It's a matter of life and<br>
    death when you take the advantage.<br>
    Me, I deal in property, in<br>
    exchange... no one gets hurt.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Which of us would you say has the<br>

    Well, let's see right now... I'm<br>

  <p> Devinoni gives Riker no time to react.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    You know, I feel responsible for<br>
    you in a way... related.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Deanna. We both love Deanna...<br>
    in different ways, of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll remove the burden of that<br>
    responsibility right now. My<br>
    relationship with Deanna stands<br>
    on its own. Without help from<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Of course it does. She's an<br>
    extraordinary woman. Lovely,<br>
    brilliant --- very passionate.</p>
  <p> He leans closer to Riker, still smiling.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    She could have been yours, Will.<br>
    But you didn't do enough to keep<br>
    her, and now, I'm here and I'm<br>
    going to take her too.</p>
  <p> Riker really looks at Devinoni, as if he's seeing him<br>
    for the first time. He relaxes back into his seat and<br>
    smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    a bad sort, Ral, you just don't<br>
    have any values... beyond the<br>

    She's just the one to give some<br>
    meaning to your sorry existence...<br>

    it. I doubt that you are.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Ral, I congratulate you<br>
    on winning the rights to the<br>
    Barzan wormhole...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (tight)<br>
    I take the risks. I stand by my<br>
    agreements.</p>
  <p> Off Riker's half grin...</p>

  <p>86 INT. CORRIDOR - AT TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> As the door opens to reveal Troi. She reacts as she<br>
    sees...</p>
  <p>87 REVERSE - DEVINONI</p>
  <p> A look.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come in...</p>
  <p>88 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    When do you leave?</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Soon. I've... been recalled by<br>
    the Chrysalians... explanations<br>
    demanded and so forth.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I've done all right for them over<br>
    the years... they know the stakes.<br>
    It'll be fine.</p>
  <p> They look at each other a long beat. &quot;Fine&quot; is not in<br>
    their faces.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    I had to do it, Troi...</p>
  <p> Troi looks at him... can't accept that...</p>

  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Bhavani was ready to go with the<br>
    the Federation. I sensed it.<br>
    And I'd used up every card in the<br>
    deck... I had to change the rules.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You must have known that I<br>
    couldn't allow you to do that...</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (beat, grins)<br>
    My human physical response must<br>
    have blocked out my Betazoid<br>
    senses.</p>
  <p> She knows, acknowledges.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In a way, I'm glad you did it.<br>
    It's made me take a hard look at<br>
    who I am. I don't like what I<br>
    see.</p>
  <p> He moves to her... she allows it.</p>
  <p> DEVINONI<br>
    Deanna... I once asked you to<br>
    run away with me. I'm asking you<br>
    again. I need you. You could<br>
    help me change. You could be my<br>
    conscience.</p>
  <p> He kisses her. After they break...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I already have a job as a<br>
    counselor.</p>

  <p>88 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He reacts. He slowly retreats to the door, shrugs...<br>
    and EXITS. On her expression, with no regrets, we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
