    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is moving gracefully at full impulse.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> JEAN-LUC PICARD is in the command chair. TROI is<br>
    beside him. DATA is at Ops; WESLEY at Conn. Neither<br>
    Worf nor Riker is on the bridge. Picard appears to<br>
    be on edge.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're worried.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With reason.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    About Worf, or about Commander<br>
    Riker?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Both.<br>
    (pauses)<br>
    I think perhaps it is best to<br>
    be ignorant of certain elements<br>
    of the Klingon psyche.</p>
  <p> Off Troi's reaction.</p>
  <p>3 INT. HOLODECK - DEMOLISHED AREA</p>
  <p> Everywhere there is evidence of a desperate battle,<br>
    fought on a very primitive level by creatures of<br>
    consummate rage.</p>
  <p>4 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> His eyes blaze with controlled fury as he moves<br>
    carefully around a semi-demolished wall and peers<br>
    inside the battle-damaged room. He coils as he hears<br>
    the eerie sound of a low moan, then cautiously steps<br>
    forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>5 RIKER</p>
  <p> is a few paces behind. He is very tense as he moves<br>
    closer to the large Klingon warrior. Riker touches<br>
    the tear in his uniform and massages the bruise on his<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE - RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> WORF touches RIKER's shoulder, signals him to move to<br>
    the right. Riker moves off. Worf pauses a beat, then<br>
    slips away to the left.</p>
  <p>7 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> carrying them to the edge of the rubble-cluttered room.<br>
    Careful not to touch anything, Worf is moving like a<br>
    panther. He freezes as the CLICKING SOUND OF METAL ON<br>
    METAL is barely heard. He waves his arm to Riker,<br>
    motioning him back, then slowly he also backs away<br>
    painstakingly, trying to fit his toes back into his<br>
    exact footsteps. We HOLD on these moves a beat and<br>
    then suddenly:</p>
  <p>8 RIKER</p>
  <p> spins and looks upward, calls over to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Above, look out!</p>
  <p>9 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A man-sized boulder drops down from overhead. Worf<br>
    dives to the side as the boulder smashes the ground in<br>
    the place where he just stood.</p>
  <p>10 ON WORF</p>
  <p> As he rolls catlike to his feet, the massive form of an<br>
    ALIEN WARRIOR leaps onto his back bringing him back to<br>
    the ground. The alien raises a club-like weapon over<br>
    his head and swings down at Worf's head.</p>
  <p>11 RIKER</p>
  <p> Catches the alien's arm just before the club makes<br>
    contact and drives him off his feet. He kicks him and<br>
    follows after him to the other side of the room as:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>12 WORF</p>
  <p> turns to face the charge of ANOTHER ALIEN who wields<br>
    a battle axe and swings it in a deadly arc. Worf ducks<br>
    under the axe and gets a grip on the alien's arm and<br>
    they press against each other's strength.</p>
  <p>13 CLOSER</p>
  <p> Worf, grunting in a half-roar, slowly forces the alien<br>
    back, then with a bellow and a gargantuan heave, Worf<br>
    throws the alien to the side.</p>
  <p>14 SCENE</p>
  <p> Worf leaps at the alien who is caught in half-stride.<br>
    Worf drives his forearm into his opponent's throat and<br>
    as he becomes limp, drives a double-handed blow to the<br>
    back of the alien's head. Worf's enemy drops.</p>
  <p>15 RIKER</p>
  <p> ducks under the alien's club and drives a blow to the<br>
    lower extremities of his opponent. The attacker<br>
    doubles over and Riker hits him on the way down. But<br>
    he no sooner hits the ground than he is back on his<br>
    feet, charging Riker. Our first officer steps to his<br>
    side and strikes at the alien as he goes by, heading<br>
    straight at Worf.</p>
  <p>16 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Worf turns to face the onrushing alien. He thunders<br>
    out his challenge, picks up the club from the prone<br>
    alien, swings it at the new rival.</p>
  <p>17 REVERSE</p>
  <p> The alien ducks the blow and swings back.</p>
  <p>18 RIKER</p>
  <p> about to enter into the fight, then he holds a beat,<br>
    stops and watches somewhat in awe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>19 WORF / ALIEN</p>
  <p> The alien connects with a savage blow to Worf's body.<br>
    Worf takes the blow and returns his own.</p>
  <p> They trade blows, one for one, taking the pain and<br>
    returning it. Then slowly the alien sinks to his<br>
    knees, then rolls over on his side.</p>
  <p>20 ON WORF</p>
  <p> as he steps over the alien warrior, roars out his<br>
    victorious celebration chant, and lifts the club for<br>
    the final fatal blow. His eyes are on fire. He<br>
    smashes it down on his opponent, then spins around for<br>
    a new battle.</p>
  <p>21 RIKER</p>
  <p> Suddenly a little unsure of Worf's intentions, he backs<br>
    a step, waits.</p>
  <p>22 WORF</p>
  <p> Worf sounds out a new challenge. He scans the room for<br>
    his next adversary -- he's still coiled and in need of<br>
    action. Suddenly he swings his club at the wall.<br>
    Pounding it with rage. Broken bricks and mortar fly.<br>
    His fury is all consuming. He rips and slashes at<br>
    everything standing.</p>
  <p>23 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker watches -- still concerned. He thought he knew<br>
    the power and fury of this Klingon. Worf continues to<br>
    exercise his rage around the room. Anything that<br>
    stands, hangs, bulges, protrudes, or is suspended, is<br>
    demolished until there is nothing left to flatten.<br>
    Nothing left upright except... Worf turns -- his eyes<br>
    still blaze as they fall upon...</p>
  <p>24 RIKER</p>
  <p> The only thing left standing. Riker tenses.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>25 WORF</p>
  <p> This seems to have no effect on Worf who seems almost<br>
    out of control. A snarl -- low and vicious -- pushes<br>
    out of his twisted mouth. He takes a step forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The exercise is over.</p>
  <p>26 SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker calls more sternly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At ease, Lieutenant!</p>
  <p> Worf is almost upon Riker before beginning to regain<br>
    control of himself. He takes a deep breath, forcing<br>
    himself to become calmer. He flexes his muscles, then<br>
    seems pleased.</p>
  <p>27 EMPHASIZING RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Exit Holodeck.</p>
  <p> The EXIT APPEARS as Riker turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You do this every day?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No -- usually my calisthenics are<br>
    more...<br>
    (he searches for the<br>
    right word, then<br>
    settles for)<br>
    ... intense, but those sessions<br>
    are too personal to be shared.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (dryly)<br>
    I'll bet they are.</p>
  <p>28 RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> takes a look around at the devastation on the Holodeck<br>
    and is thankful that Worf is on his side.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF (O.S.)<br>
    Computer. Program complete --<br>
    save.</p>
  <p> Before Riker's eyes, THE BATTLE SCENE FADES, and all<br>
    that is left is the empty Holodeck. Worf pauses at the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Coming Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right behind you.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>29 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is moving through deep space. No large planets or suns<br>
    nearby... just a Milky Way of distant suns spread<br>
    across space like a tightly woven blanket of lights.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42193.6.<br>
    We are on a long reach toward the<br>
    Morgana Quadrant, a section of<br>
    the galaxy which has yet to be<br>
    visited by a manned Federation<br>
    vessel. We are using the time<br>
    to further detail the charts of<br>
    this region.</p>
  <p>30 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Jean-Luc Picard and Riker stand beside Data as he moves<br>
    his fingers across the console. The SOUND VARIES,<br>
    SLIDING UP AND DOWN ERRATICALLY IN PITCH AND INTENSITY.<br>
    Troi stands nearby listening thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There it is again. An area of<br>
    &quot;blackness.&quot;</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It appears, then disappears, then<br>
    reappears. There is no<br>
    predictable pattern -- no sequence.</p>
  <p> Data moves his fingers across the console again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> They all turn to look.</p>
  <p>31 FULL SHOT FAVORING THE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The picture on the Main Viewer shows a field of stars.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There it is.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't see anything. Magnify<br>
    section two-eight-five.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen changes. Now we can see a slight &quot;spot&quot;<br>
    on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There -- it looks like a &quot;hole&quot;<br>
    in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're acquainted with the<br>
    &quot;wormhole&quot; phenomenon. This<br>
    appears quite different.</p>
  <p>32 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard studies the Main Viewer for a beat, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do sensors indicate?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you must mean it's empty<br>
    of matter, Mister Data. There<br>
    is always some energy form at<br>
    work...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, our sensors are showing that<br>
    to be an absence of everything.<br>
    It is a void without matter or<br>
    energy of any kind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yet, this &quot;hole&quot; has a form, Data.<br>
    It has height, width...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps. Perhaps not.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    That is hardly a scientific<br>
    observation, Commander.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, the most elementary and<br>
    valuable statement in science...<br>
    the beginning of wisdom... is:<br>
    &quot;I do not know.&quot;<br>
    (indicates viewscreen)<br>
    I do not know what that is.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, if this were any ordinary<br>
    kind of hole in space...<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    ... wouldn't we be able to see<br>
    what's behind it?</p>
  <p> Obviously, this is a very good question. Picard turns<br>
    to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can feel nothing from it, sir,<br>
    if that's what you're asking.</p>
  <p> Picard eases himself down in his chair, and sits<br>
    studying the viewscreen... puzzled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- is there any record of any<br>
    occurrence even vaguely similar<br>
    to this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Similar&quot; in even the slightest<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Accessing.<br>
    (he pauses a moment)<br>
    Negative. There is no record of<br>
    any Federation vessel encountering<br>
    anything remotely like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe we have time for a<br>
    closer look, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Concur.<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Ensign, slow to one-half impulse.<br>
    Adjust course to intercept this...<br>
    this whatever it is.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Scanning and recording as we go.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Changing course to intercept in...<br>
    in twelve minutes, sir.</p>
  <p>33 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves slowly forward under impulse power toward the<br>
    large black area in the field of stars.</p>
  <p>34 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard stands watching the viewscreen as the void on<br>
    the screen grows larger. Riker is at the science<br>
    consoles in the Aft Station. Data is busy at Ops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's send a probe into it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, prepare a scanner probe.<br>
    Let's see what's in there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Close enough, Ensign. Hold this<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir. Holding this position.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Riker a slight nod.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You may launch the probe when<br>
    ready, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf makes the necessary moves on his console to launch<br>
    the probe.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>35 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> floats off the outer edge of the void. The probe is<br>
    launched. It heads straight into the center of the<br>
    great emptiness.</p>
  <p>36 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Worf stand watching the viewscreen as<br>
    the fiery tail of the probe diminishes in the distance.<br>
    Data monitors the instruments. We can HEAR THE FAINT<br>
    HISS OF THE TELEMETRY as it is received.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All the probe's systems are<br>
    functioning perfectly.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the probe just disappears. The SOUNDS OF<br>
    TELEMETRY STOP.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It's gone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Recommend we go to a Yellow Alert,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (hesitates, then)<br>
    Sorry, sir, it's...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> Worf is definitely uncomfortable now. Clearly, he<br>
    would like to avoid this entire subject now. Picard<br>
    continues gently:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This starship operates best,<br>
    Mister Worf, when we all know what<br>
    is on each other's minds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (uncomfortably)<br>
    My thoughts... were of an old<br>
    Klingon legend of... of a gigantic<br>
    black space creature which was<br>
    said to devour entire vessels...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (genuinely surprised)<br>
    Devours vessels?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sorry, Commander. I agree that<br>
    these are thoughts hardly worthy<br>
    of a trained and practical<br>
    security officer.</p>
  <p> There is a round of silence. Worf is completely<br>
    miserable. Then to Worf, ignoring his previous<br>
    statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Launch another probe, Mister Worf.<br>
    This time a Class One with full<br>
    sensor array.</p>
  <p> Worf does something on his panel, then:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Launching, sir.</p>
  <p>37 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the second probe is launched. It too disappears<br>
    even sooner after it enters the void.</p>
  <p>38 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> All are still studying the viewscreen.</p>

    Captain, based on where the probes<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, we have no communications<br>
    outside of the void.</p>

    Confirm! We are now receiving<br>

    understand it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wish I could say I did.<br>

    Increase magnification by ten.</p>
  <p> Data punches in the command. The viewscreen remains<br>

  <p> Nothing. The viewscreen remains dark.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm not a bridge officer, but<br>
    isn't this... &quot;impossible,&quot; sir?</p>
  <p> Picard gives Pulaski a &quot;be my guest&quot; gesture.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Increase by one thousand, Mister<br>
    Data.<br>

  <p> There's no change on the Main Viewer. Pulaski turns<br>
    to Picard.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing; indicates<br>
    Data)<br>
    It does know how to do these<br>
    things, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Data knows precisely<br>
    what he is doing.</p>
  <p> Pulaski looks up quickly at Data, then turns to see<br>
    that the Captain's expression is as cold.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Forgive me, Mister Data. I'm not<br>
    accustomed to working with... with<br>
    non-living devices that...<br>
    (stops, bites off her<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, are your systems<br>
    functioning?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. Wherever we are, sir,<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p>47 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard's interest in this occurrence is waning fast.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Difficult to make a judgment based<br>
    on the absence of information.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Speculate.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The obvious hypothesis is<br>
    equivocal. This void has a total<br>
    lack of dimension. Therefore by<br>
    any accepted standard it does not<br>
    exist, yet being within it denies<br>
    that conclusion.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Pulaski.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then maybe we've moved into<br>
    another dimension?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Could a lack of dimension be<br>
    another dimension in itself?</p>
  <p> Pulaski gives Data a quick look of respect.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That's an interesting question.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Data. Lock onto the<br>
    beacon, and keep it dead astern.</p>
  <p> Data and Wesley punch in the instructions. A moment<br>

    Anywhere you say, Commander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am acquainted with the Yamato,<br>

    in doubt, surprise them.</p>

  <p> Riker and Worf SPARKLE AWAY.</p>
  <p>66 INT. USS YAMATO - CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Riker -- without Worf -- STACKS UP. It looks like<br>
    the Enterprise, as it should because it is the sister<br>
    ship -- but the lighting is weird -- and:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (the obvious)<br>
    This isn't the bridge.</p>
  <p> He turns, expecting to see Worf -- but he's alone.<br>
    Almost before Riker can react he hears a sound down the<br>
    darkened corridor. A growl -- above which he hears<br>
    Worf's roar.</p>
  <p>66A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Riker heads down the corridor -- the lighting here is<br>
    much darker. Very ominous -- in the shadows -- we see<br>
    FORMS. Threatening -- again WE HEAR WORF. This time<br>
    IN PAIN. Riker, without hesitation -- charges forward.<br>
    Ready to combat whatever attempts to block his path.<br>
    It looks like a gauntlet of terror.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>66B RIKER</p>
  <p> moves forward -- phaser ready. Suddenly, in the<br>
    darkness a large form appears. It's armed and moving<br>
    toward him. Riker hesitates -- then screams out:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No -- don't fire.</p>
  <p> The figure is on him -- the light hits the creature's<br>
    face. IT'S WORF!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I heard you screaming. I was<br>
    coming to help.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Help me? But I heard you cry out.</p>
  <p> Riker realizes something bizarre is going on.</p>

  <p> Picard gets no answer. Then suddenly the bridge goes<br>

  <p> As Riker and Worf approach the turbolift, Riker scans<br>
    the corridor wall with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This isn't a Federation ship.<br>
    The walls are not tritanium...<br>
    close, but it's a material beyond<br>
    our technology.<br>
    (he then leads the way<br>
    to the turbolift)<br>
    Let's get to the bridge.<br>
    Somewhere there must be an answer<br>
    to all of this.</p>
  <p> As they approach, the turbolift doors open. Instead of<br>
    it being the turbolift, it's the bridge, weirdly<br>
    lighted. It's identical to the Enterprise, but devoid<br>
    of people.</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker exchange looks. They cautiously enter.</p>
  <p>B84 INT. USS YAMATO - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors close behind them. Riker then<br>
    turns as if to re-enter the turbolift. The doors open<br>
    -- but it's not the turbolift... it's a duplicate of<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf again exchange looks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait -- if you go through there...<br>
    where will you be?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    On the bridge.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Is it the same bridge?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p>D84 INT. USS YAMATO BRIDGE - WORF</p>
  <p> as he approaches the second set of doors. The doors<br>
    open -- and once again it's the bridge. Worf pauses.<br>
    Then steps through.</p>
  <p>E84 RIKER</p>
  <p> As he watches the door close behind Worf, he hears from<br>
    behind him:</p>
  <p> WORF (O.S.)<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker turns. It's Worf, standing in front of the doors.<br>
    The frustration of this bizarre -- whatever it is -- can<br>
    be seen on Worf's face.</p>

    REACTION</p>
  <p> Worf turns and exits - only to appear on the other side<br>
    of the bridge. He roars... rushes to another set of<br>
    doors. Exits, only to again reappear coming out of<br>
    another set of doors. Worf's emotions quickly escalate<br>
    to rage. He turns and throws himself at the doors --<br>
    hoping somehow by force to change the sequence. But<br>
    the doors open and he once again bursts out of the<br>
    doors on the opposite side of the bridge. Worf charges<br>
    for another set. He's on the verge of being out of<br>
    control. He is about to continue his manic charge,<br>
    when he catches himself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    At ease, Lieutenant! At EASE!</p>
  <p> His own words calm him. He stops... but his<br>
    frustration is more difficult for him to control.</p>

  <p> NAGILUM<br>
    Your life-form surprises me more<br>
    and more. Is it also true that<br>
    you have only a limited existence?<br>

    Answer!</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What information do you want?<br>
    I don't understand the question.</p>
  <p> NAGILUM<br>
    You exist -- and then you cease<br>
    to exist. Your minds call it<br>
    &quot;death.&quot;</p>
  <p> At that moment, there is a CRY OF PAIN from the Aft<br>
    Section -- and they turn. Holding his head as though<br>
    it were about to explode, HASKELL staggers back from<br>
    the damaged console. He screams again.</p>
  <p> NAGILUM<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How interesting.</p>
  <p>104 ANGLE - FAVORING HASKELL</p>
  <p> Haskell sinks to his knees, moaning in agony... then<br>
    pitches forward and lies still. Doctor Pulaski has<br>
    been hurrying toward him, now kneels and checks his<br>
    vital signs. She uses a power-hypo on him once, twice.<br>
    Then she shakes her head to Picard.</p>
  <p>105 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Worf has moved in fast too, kneels.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sickbay?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It won't help. The body is<br>
    already cold.</p>

    Captain's log, Stardate 42194.7.<br>
    It is obvious that whatever we<br>
    have met sees no value in our kind<br>
    of life-form. How do we fight<br>
    something that both is...</p>
  <p>108 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>

    ... and is not there?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can sense this much. We are<br>
    unimportant to it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    In a battle for survival, Captain,<br>
    thirty to fifty percent<br>
    casualties...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    ... Would be appalling...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    ... But within acceptable limits.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is not a battle, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    A &quot;laboratory experiment&quot; would<br>
    be the closest comparison.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any reason for not<br>
    believing this Nagilum?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All evidence indicates he is<br>
    willing and able to do what he<br>
    proposes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Under the circumstances<br>
    -- there is only one decision.<br>
    I will not stand by and watch<br>
    while half of my crew is<br>
    slaughtered.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir... I do not believe there is<br>
    anything you can do to prevent<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. But I can control it.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By destroying the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Isn't that like curing the disease<br>
    by killing the patient?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At least it's better than<br>
    standing by helplessly and dying.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Why do I feel this may not have<br>
    been the best time to join this<br>
    ship? I'll be in Sickbay if I'm<br>
    needed.</p>
  <p> Pulaski exits. Data, Troi and Geordi rise and go out<br>
    after her. Wesley and Worf start out. Worf pauses at<br>
    the door:</p>

    I will be at my station, Captain.</p>

    Interesting question. How long<br>
    to prepare to die?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which is the least painful to our<br>
    crew? Move to it quickly? Or<br>
    take time to prepare for it<br>
    thoroughly?</p>

  <p>112 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The captain is lying on his bunk, staring at the<br>
    ceiling as DEBUSSY'S &quot;CLAIR DE LUNE&quot; PLAYS. CAMERA<br>
    MOVES IN to examine the expressions passing over<br>
    Picard's features as he listens. After several moments<br>
    of this, his door CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>113 TO INCLUDE TROI</p>
  <p> entering as if hesitant to disturb the captain at this<br>
    time. Picard straightens into a sitting position,<br>
    looks questioningly at her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Our destroying ourselves won't<br>
    change its mind. I could feel<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (somewhat surprised)<br>
    You didn't mention you were that<br>
    certain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was wrong not to tell you,<br>
    Captain. And your decision may<br>
    also be wrong.</p>
  <p> Picard starts to say something, but it's INTERRUPTED<br>
    BY ANOTHER SOUND from the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes? Come in, please.</p>
  <p>114 TO INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> as he enters, hesitant too.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have a question, sir.<br>
    (sits)<br>
    What is death?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've picked probably the most<br>
    difficult of all questions, Data.</p>
  <p> There is the beginning of a twinkle in Picard's eyes<br>
    again. It is the sort of question that his mind loves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>114 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Some explain it by inventing<br>
    gods wearing their own form...<br>
    and argue that the purpose of the<br>
    entire universe is to maintain<br>
    themselves in their present form<br>
    in an Earth-like garden which<br>
    will give them pleasure through<br>
    all eternity. And at the other<br>
    extreme, assuming that is an<br>
    &quot;extreme,&quot; are those who prefer<br>
    the idea of our blinking into<br>
    nothingness with all our<br>
    experiences, hopes and dreams only<br>
    an illusion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Which do you believe?</p>
  <p>114A CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> considering the question.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Considering the marvelous<br>
    complexity of our universe, its<br>
    clockwork perfection, its balances<br>
    of this against that... matter,<br>
    energy, gravitation, time,<br>
    dimension, pattern, I believe<br>
    our existence must mean more than<br>
    a meaningless illusion. I prefer<br>
    to believe that my and your<br>
    existence goes beyond Euclidian<br>
    and other &quot;practical&quot; measuring<br>
    systems... and that, in ways<br>
    we cannot yet fathom, our<br>
    existence is part of a reality<br>
    beyond what we understand now<br>
    as reality.</p>
  <p> A moment of silence, then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We should not let ourselves die,<br>
    Jean-Luc!</p>
  <p> Picard is startled by the fact this statement comes<br>
    from Troi of all people. Geordi has ENTERED as:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Where Silence... &quot; - 9/27/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>114A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I agree with her, Captain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If only half of us live, I prefer<br>
    to take my chances on being one<br>
    that does.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes. It's wrong of you to force<br>
    us into this...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is wrong...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Yes, this is very wrong. None<br>
    of you should be reacting like<br>
    this.</p>

    Well, Nagilum... I hope you got<br>

  <p> NAGILUM<br>
    You have provided me with much<br>
    more than I needed...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why did you release us? You<br>
    could have seen how we faced<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> NAGILUM<br>
    It wasn't necessary. I have<br>
    learned all I needed to know.<br>
    Would you like me to share some<br>
    of my conclusions?</p>

    Of course you are. You are too<br>
    inquisitive not to want to know.<br>
    (he pauses)<br>
    You seem to find no tranquility<br>
    in anything. You struggle against<br>
    the inevitable. You thrive on<br>
    conflict. You are selfish, yet<br>
    you value loyalty. You are rash,<br>
    quick to judge, slow to change.<br>
    It's amazing you've survived.<br>
    Be that as it may -- as species,<br>
    we have no common ground. You<br>
    are too aggressive. Too hostile.<br>
    Too militant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    During this period, you too have<br>
