  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42823.2.<br>
    My meeting with Admiral James<br>
    Moore has offered me an<br>
    interesting proposal. We have<br>
    completed our repairs, and are<br>
    preparing to warp out.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD is listening to the raspy, static filled TONES<br>
    of an SOS code. RIKER enters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Recognize that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir, I'm sorry, I don't.</p>
  <p> Picard turns off the signal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's an old style Terran distress<br>
    beacon. It kicked in last month,<br>
    and was detected by the starbase.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's its origin point?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Ficus quadrant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (thinks for a moment)<br>
    Captain, there are no records of<br>
    an Earth colony in that area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral Moore has offered us the<br>
    task of investigating the signal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with a grin)<br>
    And of course we've accepted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Am I so transparent?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You've got that look in your eye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a little uncomfortable)<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The lure of a mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A lost Earth colony. That is an<br>
    exciting idea.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They may not have survived.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're calling for help, aren't<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're an optimist.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Always.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the oscillations of the sound appear on the<br>
    screen, then a page of print.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Signal analysis complete.<br>
    Distress beacon used by the<br>
    European Hegemony.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The European Hegemony?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A loose alliance that formed in<br>
    the early twenty-second century. It was<br>
    the first step toward a world<br>
    government. You should read more<br>
    history, Number One. Computer,<br>
    bracket exact dates when this<br>
    beacon was in general use.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Old Earth calendar, 2123 until<br>
    2190.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No extraterrestrial source has<br>
    ever used this beacon?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Negative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Locate all Earth deep space<br>
    launches from 2123 until 2190,<br>
    and list their destinations.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Working.</p>
  <p> A neat two column list appears on the screen. Picard<br>
    scans it eagerly. Then leans back in disappointment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing for the Ficus quadrant.<br>
    Damn it, who's out there?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Guess we'll have to wait and ask<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS, and Picard stares thoughtfully off into<br>
    space, contemplating the mystery.</p>
  <p>3A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise travelling at warp.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker has the bridge. Data is at OPS, Worf at<br>
    Tactical. Supernumeraries at the other stations. Worf<br>
    is not feeling well, but trying to hide it. Klingons<br>
    don't get sick. But as Riker and Data continue their<br>
    casual desultory conversation, Worf's faintness<br>
    increases.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How could a spaceship leave Earth<br>
    without some kind of a record?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps it was deliberate. They<br>
    may have wished to escape<br>
    detection.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're suggesting they were<br>
    fugitives?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    During the Eugenics Wars a group<br>
    of genetically superior humans<br>
    ruled the world. After their<br>
    defeat some did escape.</p>
  <p> Riker is becoming aware of Worf's silence. Riker<br>
    stands and looks back at the Klingon. (This is light,<br>
    just shoot the breeze conversation.)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you think, Worf. Can we<br>
    handle supermen?</p>
  <p> The Klingon lets out a long growling groan, and faints<br>
    dead away. Data and Riker rush up the ramp.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Medical emergency! Doctor Pulaski<br>
    to the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The android and the first officer stare in amazement<br>
    and concern at the unconscious Worf as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>6 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Worf is on a biobed. Pulaski is running a tricorder<br>
    over him, and comparing the hand held readouts to the<br>
    overhead display.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am fine.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You are not fine, you fainted.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I did not faint. Klingons do not<br>
    faint.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Excuse me, I'll rephrase. This<br>
    Klingon suffered a dramatic drop<br>
    in blood pressure, his blood<br>
    glucose level dropped, there was<br>
    deficient blood flow resulting<br>
    from perpheral circulatory<br>
    failure, in other words he curled<br>
    up his toes and laid unconscious<br>
    on the floor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor, there is no need to insult<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Worf, I'm worried. Something's<br>
    wrong. Klingons don't faint --<br>
    forgive me, but I can't think of<br>
    another word which applies --<br>
    for no reason. You're sick.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons don't get sick.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (tartly)<br>
    They sure do get stupid. Stay<br>
    there! I need to check something<br>
    with the computer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She crosses to a computer console. Checks some medical<br>
    texts. Crosses back to Worf. She is trying vainly<br>
    to suppress a smile.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Lieutenant, you've got rop'ngor.</p>
  <p> Worf looks horrified.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor, no one must learn that<br>
    I am suffering from a childhood<br>
    ailment!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I have to file a report.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But it is so humiliating!</p>
  <p>7<br>

  <p>11 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is seated at his desk thoughtfully knuckling<br>
    his chin as he studies the computer screen. This thing<br>
    has gotten under his skin, and all his scholarly<br>
    instincts are engaged. He is going to find the answer.</p>
  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, Doctor, how is Worf?</p>
  <p>11A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's in no danger. Worf was<br>
    observing a Klingon ritual<br>
    involving fasting, and he didn't<br>
    take into account that you need<br>
    to decrease physical activity as<br>
    you decrease caloric intake.<br>
    Pulaski out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11B INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard resumes his research. There is a CHIME.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS, and crosses to Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, there is a discrepancy<br>
    between our requisition order<br>
    for display panels and the number<br>
    actually tendered by the<br>
    starbase.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can something so simple<br>
    become so complicated?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Such is the nature of a<br>
    bureaucracy?</p>
  <p> Suddenly Picard reacts. He leans eagerly into the<br>
    computer, and touches a pad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself and cutting<br>
    off Data)<br>
    There's more than one way to skin<br>
    a bureaucratic cat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's no record of a launch to<br>
    the Ficus quadrant. Not unusual<br>
    if you consider the chaos of the<br>
    early twenty-second century, but someone<br>
    had to load that ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah, yes, the manifest.</p>
  <p> A page appears on the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There it is. The Mariposa, launch<br>
    date November 27, 2123. Captain<br>
    Walter Granger, commanding.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Mariposa is the Spanish word for<br>
    butterfly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I thought it might be significant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It doesn't appear to be. Ah...<br>
    and here is the cargo list.<br>
    (in an aside to Data)<br>
    You can tell a lot about people<br>
    from their luggage. Let's see,<br>
    two hundred and twenty five<br>
    Yoshimitsu computers, five<br>
    monitor beacon satellites, seven<br>
    hundred cellular commlinks, fifty<br>
    spinning wheels --</p>
  <p> Data is confused. (Data and Picard's dialogue should<br>
    proceed simultaneously.)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spinning wheels? Accessing. A<br>
    device for spinning yarn or thread<br>
    that consists of a large foot or<br>
    hand driven wheel and one spindle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cattle, chickens, pigs. . . . not<br>
    DNA, the actual livestock.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Incredible. Why would anyone<br>
    carry such an insane mix of cargo?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spindle -- a thin rounded tapering<br>
    rod --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Data!</p>
  <p> The android jerks himself back to the present, but very<br>
    coolly responds.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps they were planning for<br>
    the worst.<br>
    (Data goes into<br>
    analysis mode)<br>
    In the early twenty-second century<br>
    Earth was recovering from World<br>
    War III. A major philosopher<br>
    of the period was Liam Dieghan,<br>
    the founder of the<br>
    Neo-Transcendentalists. He<br>
    advocated a return to a simpler<br>
    life in which one lived in harmony<br>
    with nature, and learned under<br>
    her gentle tutelage --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Data. But if this was<br>
    a ship full of utopians, why<br>
    carry the technological baggage?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I have insufficient<br>
    information from which to form<br>
    a cogent theory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hate a mystery.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (confused)<br>
    But, sir what about Dixon Hill,<br>
    and your penchant for detective<br>
    fiction --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Allow me to correct myself. I<br>
    hate a mystery I cannot solve.</p>
  <p> Off Data's thoughtful expression as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> booting along at warp speed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12A INT. SICKBAY - PULASKI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> She is working. Suddenly Worf is in the doorway<br>
    carrying a tray set with two delicate, yet spartan<br>
    cups, a stone tea pot and a thorn-covered branch with<br>
    a single blossom midway up the branch. (The thorns<br>
    need to look like curving hooks.)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I wished to thank you for<br>
    protecting my --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Your secret is safe with me.</p>
  <p> He sets down the tray, strips several of the thorns<br>
    from the branch and tosses them into the steaming pot.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Worf, I'm honored. No one has<br>
    ever made the Tea for me.</p>
  <p> She plucks off the white blossom, and places it in one<br>
    of the cups so the tea pours through its petals. Worf<br>
    looks at her in surprise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You know the ceremony?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I understand the externals. Not<br>
    the mysteries. I'm not a<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must not drink the tea. It<br>
    is deadly to humans.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    And none too good for Klingons.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a test of bravery, of one's<br>
    ability to look at the face of<br>
    mortality. It is also a reminder<br>
    that death is an experience best<br>
    shared -- like the tea.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Worf, you're a romantic.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is among the Klingons that<br>
    love poetry achieves its fullest<br>
    flower.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Hold that thought.</p>
  <p> Pulaski leaves the office. Quickly returns with a<br>
    hypospray. She pours out Worf's cup, hands it to him.<br>
    Gives herself an injection. Picks up her cup, and<br>
    drinks. Worf starts to react. She holds him off with<br>
    an upraised hand.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Antidote. If we're going to<br>
    share, let's share. Now, quote<br>
    me a little of that poetry.</p>
  <p> Off his expression as we GO TO:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - A SUN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Throwing out spectacular flares. We trace one of these<br>
    tongues of fire as it seems to almost touch a planet.</p>
  <p>13A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, TROI, Riker, Worf and Data.<br>
    Supernumerary at CONN.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Scans indicate human life form<br>
    readings thirty meters below the<br>
    planet's surface.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing on all frequencies,<br>
    Captain. So far no response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no evidence of an<br>
    advanced communication network.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But the comlinks?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is no artifical power<br>
    source on the planet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13A CONTINUED:</p>

    But they've got a monitoring<br>
    satellite.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    A good thing, too. Without it<br>
    we would never have known they<br>
    needed help.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, the stellar flares are<br>
    increasing in intensity and<br>
    frequency. Computer projections<br>
    indicate they will envelope the<br>
    planet in three point six hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, prepare for immediate<br>
    evacuation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Evacuation will be difficult.<br>
    Our shields can be lowered for<br>
    transport only between the flares.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, these people have been<br>
    isolated for three hundred<br>
    years. We cannot beam them to<br>
    the Enterprise without warning.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And if they have slipped back<br>
    into barbarism the experience<br>
    would scare them to death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll have to go down there,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.</p>

    to begin the evacuation.</p>
  <p>15 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Troi, Worf and Data.<br>
    Supernumerary at CONN.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's the situation, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    There are roughly two hundred<br>
    people down here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Their condition?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Surprisingly good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are they willing to leave?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, but --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Well, get them up here.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm having a little altercation<br>
    with the colony's leader.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not interested, Commander.<br>
    Initiate the transport.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    But, sir --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No arguments.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, aye, sir, we're on our way.<br>
    All of us. Riker out.</p>

  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges a quizzical glance with Troi who<br>
    merely shrugs. In the background we hear the SOUNDS<br>
    of people, the bleat of goats, the cackle of chickens,<br>
    the squealing of pigs.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Uh... Captain, you better get down<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Troi an incredulous glance, and she<br>
    stifles a giggle. Off Picard's expression as we GO<br>
    TO:</p>
  <p>15A INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN, his eyes bugging out of his head regards the<br>
    Bringloidi refugees, and DANILO complete with their<br>
    livestock, who are climbing off the transporter<br>
    platform.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

  <p>16 OMITTED</p>
  <p>17 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf are hustling down the corridor. The<br>
    Transporter Room doors open, and a terrified chicken<br>
    comes clucking and weaving its way into the corridor.<br>
    (Worf presses himself against the corridor wall. It's<br>
    the elephant and the mouse.) The doors open again, and<br>
    out comes a SMALL GIRL who gathers up the hen, and<br>
    carries her back into the Transporter Room. Worf and<br>
    Picard exchange glances, and follow the child and the<br>
    livestock into the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>18 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> It is a scene of chaos. Straw, feathers and animal<br>
    droppings litter the platform, and spill out onto the<br>
    floor. An older man, DANILO ODELL, dressed in boots,<br>
    homespun pants and a handknit sweater, and holding a<br>
    flask, is directing traffic and bending O'Brien's ear.<br>
    People, all holding some kind of livestock (crates of<br>
    chickens, a lamb, a piglet), are milling around the<br>
    Transporter Room. (A second wave of Bringloidi, with<br>
    Riker among them, are climbing off the transporter<br>
    platform.) O'Brien stares in consternation at a goat<br>
    on a lead which is sniffing at his pants, and tries<br>
    to respond to Danilo.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Ah, O'Brien, I should have known<br>
    that a good Irishman would be<br>
    running this ship, and not some<br>
    Frenchy.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to the goat)<br>
    Shoo! Shoo, damn you!</p>
  <p> Danilo reacts to this, because he's not sure who<br>
    O'Brien is addressing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What the devil is going on<br>
    here?!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Danilo saunters toward Picard. Riker notices and<br>
    starts pushing through the crowd.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Oh, Picard is it. The man who<br>
    makes decisions for me and mine<br>
    without so much as a by-your-<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't like the man's tone to the captain. He<br>
    lets out a low throated rumble. Danilo stares at the<br>
    flask, at Worf, gives his head a shake, and carefully<br>
    pockets the flask.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (re Worf)<br>
    Do you generally have him on a<br>
    leash?</p>
  <p> Worf snarls, but he is a little taken aback by this<br>
    insouciance. Riker finally pushes through the crowd.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My security chief, Lieutenant<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Danilo Odell, at your service.</p>
  <p> He extends his hand to Picard. Picard ignores it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't want your service, Mister<br>
    Odell. I want this damn<br>
    livestock off my ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sotto voce to Picard)<br>
    You said you didn't want to waste<br>
    time arguing.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Captain, this damn livestock has<br>
    fed our children, been company<br>
    to the old and sick and playmates<br>
    to the young...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And can this man ever argue.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    ... I couldn't leave them to<br>
    die. Besides, how can we rebuild<br>
    without our animals?</p>
  <p> This is beginning to appeal to Picard's sense of the<br>
    absurd.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Alright. Chief O'Brien, kindly<br>
    transport this group to Cargo<br>
    Hold Seven, and the remaining<br>
    refugees on the planet should go<br>
    directly into the hold so we can<br>
    stop dirtying my ship.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Danilo turns and bellows to the assembled Bringloidi.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Back onto the infernal machine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're taking another little ride.</p>
  <p> The Bringloidi and Riker cram onto the platform.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    We've got to have a little talk.</p>
  <p> Picard finds himself propelled into the corridor by<br>
    Danilo. Worf follows.</p>
  <p>18A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Er... fine, and then Mister Worf<br>
    can show you the ship.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    That would be grand. And Captain,<br>
    it was grand of you to resue us<br>
    from out troubles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very dry)<br>
    My pleasure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>18A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The threesome walk together, Picard a little hunched<br>
    shouldered. He is really intent on getting to that<br>
    turbolift.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    You must be worth quite a bit to<br>
    own a ship like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't own the Enterprise, I<br>
    command her.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Whatever. Would you happen to<br>
    be married?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Why?</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    I have a daughter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (very dry)<br>
    I felicitate you.</p>
  <p> They have reached the turbolift, and Picard steps in.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Would you be interested?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (explosively)<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> The doors start to shut, and Danilo squeezes quickly<br>
    into the turbolift.</p>
  <p>18B INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    You're sure?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes!</p>
  <p> Danilo holds up his hands placatingly, and backs out of<br>
    the turbolift. Off Picard's reactions as we GO TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>19 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Riker, Worf and Pulaski.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    What is the colonists' overall<br>
    condition?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    They're a little hungry, a little<br>
    scared, but hiding it well. They<br>
    were suffering from an amazing<br>
    variety of preventable diseases -- but<br>
    the transporter handled<br>
    that. They're also tough,<br>
    determined and fun. Overall,<br>
    I'd say they're charming examples<br>
    of homo sapiens at their best.</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    What's the total?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Two hundred and twenty-three.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Count on four more in the next<br>
    few days.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Next question, what to do with<br>
    them? Take them to a starbase?<br>
    They were anachronistic in 2123.<br>
    How will they cope?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's no question they could<br>
    learn and adapt, but it would be<br>
    dislocating, and the colony would<br>
    probably be splintered. Maybe<br>
    we should be looking for a new<br>
    home for them?</p>
  <p> Suddenly there is a strident klaxon as an internal<br>
    alarm goes off. Worf taps his insignia.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, report!</p>

  <p> Everyone is heading for the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I wonder what they've done to my<br>
    ship now.</p>
  <p> And despite his concern Riker has to grin.</p>

    Unseal the doors.</p>
  <p> Worf punches in the override code into the computer and<br>
    the doors open. Danilo staggers out. He is drenched,<br>
    clutching his heart, really playing this to the hilt.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    My God, Picard, the place is a<br>
    bloody death trap! Lightning<br>
    bolts falling from the ceiling!</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Worf follow Danilo back into the<br>
    cargo hold.</p>
  <p>20A INT. CARGO HOLD</p>
  <p> People are milling about, subdued, frightened chatter<br>
    fills the hold.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What the hell was that thing?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Automated fire system. A force<br>
    field contains the flames until<br>
    the available oxygen within the<br>
    field has been consumed.</p>

  <p>20A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    What if I had been under that<br>
    thing?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You would have been standing in<br>
    the fire.</p>
  <p> Danilo glares at the Klingon, not sure if he's being<br>
    made the butt of a joke, but that dark, impassive face<br>
    gives away nothing.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Well, ignoring that for the<br>
    moment. What would have happened<br>
    to me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You would have suffocated and<br>
    died.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Sweet mercy.</p>
  <p> Danilo has led the officers to a corner where a few<br>
    slightly charred sticks are surrounded by a wide pool<br>
    of spilled soup. A large iron cauldron is tipped on<br>
    its side, obviously the source of this mess. Standing<br>
    near this mess like an outraged goddess is Danilo's<br>
    daughter BRENNA. She is a stunningly beautiful young<br>
    woman, and her soaked gown is revealing every lovely<br>
    curve. Arms militantly akimbo she eyes Picard.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Your hospitality leaves a hell<br>
    of a lot to be desired! You don't<br>
    offer us a bite or a sup, and when<br>
    we build a fire to cook a little<br>
    something, the place goes mad!</p>
  <p> She flings aside the ladel she is holding. Riker is<br>
    staring in wonder at Brenna.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My apologies, ma'am, I was unaware<br>
    that you had not been instructed<br>
    in the use of the food dispensers.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (truculently to Riker)<br>
    And what are you staring at? Have<br>
    you never seen a woman before?</p>

    I thought I had.</p>
  <p> Danilo slops forward with an incredibly ingratiating<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    Commander, may I present my<br>
    daughter, Brenna Odell.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very pleased to meet you, ma'am.</p>
  <p> They shake hands, and Riker keeps holding hers. She<br>
    glances pointedly down at his hand, up at him.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    You may have all the time in the<br>
    world, but I've dozens of<br>
    frightened and hungry women and<br>
    children to care for.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about the men?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (with asperity)<br>
    I'm sure they'll find their<br>
    comfort as they always do -- in<br>
    the bottom of a mug of home brew!</p>
  <p> She disappears around some cargo containers and hung<br>
    blankets.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (to Riker with an<br>
    ingratiating smile)<br>
    Pay her no heed, she's a grand<br>
    girl. And not usually so...<br>
    er...<br>
    (he coughs)<br>
    ... sharp tongued.</p>
  <p> BRENNA (V.O.)<br>
    (like a Banshee)<br>
    Father!</p>
  <p> Danilo darts away at Brenna's bellow. Picard throws<br>
    back his head, and begins to laugh. Riker stares at<br>
    him.</p>

    Of all the reactions that's not<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, there are times in<br>
    life when you have to simply bow<br>
    to the absurd.</p>
  <p> Danilo returns from around a cargo container.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    How did the ship sense the fire?</p>
  <p> The three officers exchange glances. How do you<br>
    explain something as complex as the Enterprise to a<br>
    nineteenth century man?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (clearing his throat)<br>
    The... ah... ship's computers<br>
    sense a localized increase in --</p>
  <p> Brenna emerges from behind the cargo containers with an<br>
    armful of blankets.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Men! Always talking when there's<br>
    work to be done.</p>
  <p> She throws them down on the spilled soup.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (continuing to Picard)<br>
    Shouldn't you be flying this ship,<br>
    or whatever it is you do?</p>
  <p> So powerful and driving is her personality that the<br>
    Enterprise officers find themselves heading for the<br>
    doors. Riker suddenly pauses and says a little too<br>
    casually.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I'll go give her some<br>
    help, Captain.</p>
  <p> Worf and Picard EXIT the shot, and Riker walks back to<br>
    Brenna. She is fastidiously picking up the sodden<br>
    blankets.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    That wasn't necessary. The ship<br>
    will clean itself.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Well, good for the bloody ship!</p>
  <p> For the first time, she actually looks at Riker and<br>
    realizes how handsome he is. She gives him a<br>
    speculative glance from beneath her eyelashes. Then<br>
    lifts the sodden hem of her skirt, and inspects her<br>
    feet.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (continuing, cooing<br>
    like a dove)<br>
    Where does a girl go to wash her<br>
    feet on this ship?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think it's the responsibility<br>
    of the ship's first officer to<br>
    show that girl all the amenities.</p>
  <p> Riker holds out a hand to her. She lays her hand in<br>
    his, and gives him a heart-stopping smile. Off their<br>

  <p>24 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Pulaski is treating an ancient Bringloidi. Riker and<br>
    Brenna ENTER. Pulaski runs a device over the OLD<br>
    MAN'S arm, and cures his crippling rheumatoid<br>
    arthritis. His claw-like hand relaxes and he<br>
    experimentally wiggles the fingers. Brenna is amazed.<br>
    This is magic. The old man is so pleased with this<br>
    new mobility that as Pulaski turns away to replace the<br>
    device he leans off the biobed, and pinches her on<br>
    the ass. Pulaski calmly swats his hand.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Behave yourself.</p>
  <p> OLD MAN<br>
    You're a fine woman, and you've<br>
    made a young man of me.</p>

    attention.</p>
  <p> Riker chuckles. He doesn't mind being made the butt of<br>
    a joke. Brenna crosses to Pulaski.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    How did you give Joey back his<br>
    hand?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (picking up the<br>
    instrument)<br>
    Oh dear, that would be difficult<br>
    to explain.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    Like everything else aboard this<br>
    ship. I'm too ignorant to<br>
    understand. And this is the one<br>
    thing that looks useful.</p>
  <p> The frustration is evident in her voice. Pulaski says<br>
    very gently --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You're interested in medicine?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    I'm healer and midwife. Or I<br>
    thought I was.</p>
  <p> Pulaski tries to comfort her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    All I've every wanted is to take<br>
    away the hurt. These wonderful<br>
    tools help me do that, but<br>
    sometimes I feel more like a<br>
    mechanic than a doctor.</p>
  <p> Now the situation's reversed. Brenna takes Pulaski's<br>
    hand in both of hers, closes her eyes as she searches<br>
    for the healing power.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    You've the hands of a healer.<br>
    You can't put that in a machine.</p>
  <p> Suddenly there's a hell of a bond between these women.<br>
    Riker knows when he's a fifth wheel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll leave you ladies to your<br>
    discussions. Dinner, Brenna?<br>
    I'll cook.</p>
  <p> Brenna glances at Pulaski and raises her eyebrows.<br>
    Leans in close, keeping it private between the two of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Is he real?</p>
  <p> Both of the women are eyeing Riker thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (sotto voce to Brenna)<br>
    Oh, yes, very real.</p>
  <p> The message is subtle -- when life offers you<br>
    something... take it. Riker knows female bonding when<br>
    he sees it. He gets the hell out of the way. Riker<br>
    EXITS.</p>
  <p>24A INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (FORMERLY SCENE 26)</p>
  <p> Brenna and Riker ENTER. The first officer has left<br>
    books spilled across his desk. Brenna surveys the<br>
    disorder.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    William Riker, you're a mess.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>24A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She moves to the desk, and begins stacking the books.<br>
    Riker catches her by the shoulders, and turns her<br>
    around. They are very close.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You don't have to do that.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    And if I don't, who will?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can see why your father wants<br>
    to marry you off.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Oh, and why is that?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (imitating the patois)<br>
    So he can have a pipe, and mug<br>
    of beer in peace.</p>
  <p> Brenna is eyeing him speculatively.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    You've shown me so many wonders<br>
    on your great ship, but there is<br>
    still one thing you haven't shown<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> Brenna lifts the floor length heavy skirt revealing<br>
    her feet and a pair of gorgeous legs.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    I'm still waiting to wash my feet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Through there. Glass of wine<br>
    while I cook?</p>
  <p> Riker keys a wall panel and soft, romantic music fills<br>
    the room. He pours out two glasses of wine from the<br>
    carafe. Brenna is staring at him in confusion. We have<br>
    two people from completely different cultures trying<br>
    to seduce each other, but they don't have the proper<br>
    cues.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    William, is something wrong?</p>

  <p>24A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Do you not like girls?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course I like... Oh... is there<br>
    a technique to this foot washing?</p>
  <p> Brenna approaches him. Unhooks her skirt. It puddles<br>
    about her feet, and she steps out of it wearing a<br>
    pretty petticoat.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    You generally start low... and<br>
    work your way up.</p>
  <p> Riker reaches up pulls the pins from her long hair.<br>
    It cascades over her shoulders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I can handle that.</p>
  <p> They are in each other's arms now.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    I was hoping you might.</p>
  <p> They embrace as we GO TO</p>
  <p>24B EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Booting along at warp speed.</p>
  <p>24C INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data has the bridge. Supernumeraries at all other<br>
    stations. Worf is heading for the forward turbolift as<br>
    Riker emerges from the forward lift. The first officer<br>
    looks very content.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Feeling better, Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. And you, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Couldn't be better.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p>24D INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Brenna, also looking very content, is tatting lace (or<br>
    sewing). Suddenly she notices movement behind some<br>
    cargo containers.</p>
  <p>25 INT. CARGO BAY - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A secluded corner behind some cargo containers. Danilo<br>
    and two other men are working about a still. Worf<br>
    comes around the containers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You sent for me?</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    We're brewing poteen, but we need<br>
    a way to heat it without this<br>
    bloody ship firing bloody<br>
    lightning bolts at us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You can obtain spiritous liquors<br>
    from the food dispensers.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (suspicious)<br>
    It's not that synthehol bilge<br>
    O'Brien offered me, is it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, if you wish it can be real<br>
    alcohol.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT THREE 32.</p>

  <p> DANILO<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    effects intact.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    As it should be.</p>
  <p> In the b.g. a group of Bringloidi cluster about a food<br>
    dispenser. Danilo leads Worf to the wall unit and<br>
    pushes past the waiting tinkerers.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You see, lad, every moment of<br>
    pleasure has to be purchased by<br>
    an equal moment of pain.<br>
    (to the wall unit)<br>
    Whiskey.</p>
  <p> A glass MATERIALIZES. Danilo tries a belt. Makes a<br>
    face. After a lifetime of drinking potato whiskey this<br>
    is really poor stuff -- far too refined.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Terrible.</p>
  <p> He passes the glass to the other men who sip then nod<br>
    in agreement.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>

    It's got no bite.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to the unit)<br>
    Chech'tluth.</p>
  <p> A glass of the potent Klingon brew MATERIALIZES. Worf<br>
    hands it to Danilo. The human knocks back a slug.<br>
    It feels as if his lungs and stomach have been<br>
    vaporized.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (almost unable to speak)<br>
    Now that's what I call a wee drop<br>
    of the creature.</p>

    (continuing to Worf)<br>
    You remember that moment of pain?<br>
    Well, it's about to begin.</p>
  <p> Brenna comes roaring up to join them. Danilo stares<br>
    at her in comic dismay, with a big ingratiating grin.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Hello, darling.</p>
  <p> She snatches away the glass.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Darling is it! I might have<br>
    known!<br>
    (re the glass)<br>
    Are you drunk yet, or can you talk<br>
    with Doctor Pulaski about the<br>
    children?</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    What about them?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    She wants to send them to school<br>
    with the ship's children.</p>
  <p> DANILO<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    I think it's a good idea.</p>
  <p> Danilo nods thoughtfully, pulls out his pipe and starts<br>
    to fill it.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    So go handle it!</p>
  <p> He jumps like a startled deer, and EXITS. Brenna turns<br>
    her gaze on the two cronies. They visibly wilt.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I'm sure there's something<br>
    you can be doing with your time.</p>
  <p> They fade back into the other Bringloidi, but they're<br>
    still visible. Brenna turns on Worf.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    And as for you...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What!</p>
  <p> Brenna is unimpressed.</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    Why did you have to tell them that<br>
    this magic wall can give them more<br>
    than meat and potatoes? Now we'll<br>
    never get a lick of work out of<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> She's appealed to Worf's sense of humor. Dryly he<br>
    asks.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Madam, have you considered a<br>
    career in security?</p>
  <p> BRENNA<br>
    If it's anything like babysitting<br>
    (she jerks thumb toward<br>

    We feared that Earth had suffered<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid you were lost in the<br>

    door opens, and an athletic black man (2C) steps out,<br>
    and walks toward the front doors. Worf does a double<br>
    take, but can't quite get a look at the man.</p>
  <p> GRANGER 1B<br>
    Your arrival really is<br>
    serendipitous.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh, how so?</p>
  <p> GRANGER 1B<br>
    Well, perhaps I should leave that<br>
    for the prime minister to<br>
    explain.</p>
  <p> The away team walks past the open door of an office.<br>
    Seated at a desk is the ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (4A)<br>
    working at a computer. Another woman (4B) comes down<br>
    the hall, and enters the office with 4A. Riker stops<br>
    and stares in at these twins, then hurries to catch up.<br>
    Riker catches Worf and says in a low tone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    Captain's log, supplemental. Prime<br>
    Minister Granger has requested<br>
    an urgent meeting to discuss the<br>
    future of the Mariposan colony.</p>
  <p>33 INT. GRANGER'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Riker, Pulaski and Granger. There<br>
    is a coffee service on the desk, and they are each<br>
    holding a glass. Pulaski has her tricorder in her lap.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    Captain, we need your help.<br>
    Three hundred years ago during<br>
    our landing on Mariposa, the skin<br>
    of the ship was breached. Only<br>
    five colonists survived. The<br>
    progenitors weren't willing to<br>
    just give up and die, and they<br>
    were scientists --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So they used that expertise and<br>
    turned to cloning.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    Yes. They had no other option.<br>
    Two women and three men were an<br>
    insufficient gene pool from which<br>
    to build a society.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How did you suppress the natural<br>
    sexual drive? Drugs? Punitive<br>
    laws?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Send In The Clones&quot; - 3/17/89 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    In the beginning we used a little<br>
    of both. Now three hundred years<br>
    later the entire concept of<br>
    sexual reproduction is a little<br>
    repugnant to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A culture with no children.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    It's economically more viable to<br>
    accelerate clone growth. Some<br>
    basic learning can be chemically<br>
    imprinted on the developing clone,<br>
    the rest we do after emergence.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How did you overcome the problem<br>
    of replicative fading?</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    We didn't.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You have got a problem.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait. I don't understand.<br>
    Replecative fading?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Each time you clone you're making<br>
    a copy of a copy. Subtle errors<br>
    creep into the chromosomes, and<br>
    eventually you end up with a<br>
    non-viable clone.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    Yes. We're developing a sort<br>
    of mental hardening of the<br>
    arteries. It's increasingly<br>
    difficult to respond to new<br>
    situations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can we help?</p>

  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    We need an infusion of fresh DNA.<br>
    I was hoping that you would be<br>
    willing to share tissue samples<br>
    from your crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You want to clone us?</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No way. Not me.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    How can you possibly be harmed?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not a question of harm. A<br>
    single William Riker is unique,<br>
    maybe even special. Hundreds or<br>
    thousands of them diminish me in<br>
    a way I can't explain.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    You would be preserving yourself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Human beings have another way of<br>
    doing that. We have children.</p>
  <p> Granger looks to Pulaski. She shakes her head,<br>
    refusing. To Picard who also shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think you will find this to be<br>
    the attitude of a predominate<br>
    number of Enterprise people.</p>
  <p> GRANGER<br>
    I see. Well, if you will not help<br>
    us by sharing your DNA will you<br>
    at least send people to repair<br>
    our malfunctioning equipment?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, of course. Number One, form<br>
    away teams, and get the repairs<br>
    underway.</p>

    2C).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You sent for us?</p>
  <p> The clones by the door draw phaser-like weapons, and<br>
    fire at Riker and Pulaski. They collapse. The two<br>
    athletic clones heft Riker by the shoulders and feet,<br>
    clones 5A and 5B take Pulaski. They start to carry<br>
    the officers out a side door.</p>
  <p> There is a knock, clone 2A opens the door.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I finally understand. That<br>

    Is there some reason why we<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, every time I asked where<br>
    you were, some clone lied to me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (very grim)<br>
    Lied to you?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (removes his VISOR)<br>
    Commander, with this I can see<br>
    a lot more than your average<br>
    person. When people lie there<br>
    are certain physical<br>
    manifestations; variations in<br>
    blush response, pupil dilation,<br>
    pulse and breath rate. I can't<br>
    use the VISOR on aliens, but<br>
    humans -- I've got them nailed.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>

    whereabouts?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't remember anything<br>
    happening. I was working in<br>

    a call to report to Granger's<br>
    office. I ran into Will on the<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Granger said he hadn't seen<br>
    either of you. Did you get to<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Although you can clone from any<br>

    lining the stomach are the best<br>
    choice because they're relatively<br>

  <p> Riker whirls, and heads toward the door. He is<br>
    furiously angry.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Riker, Pulaski and Geordi beam into the chamber. At<br>
    last we see two of the cloning units. Riker<br>
    approaches one of the smoke filled artificial wombs.<br>
    He opens the door, and the smoke vents into the lab.<br>
    Inside is a half-formed clone, but it is still<br>
    recognizably the first officer.</p>
  <p> He recoils. We see his anger and disgust as he gropes<br>
    for his phaser.</p>

    and cocks his head toward the clone. Pulaski nods.</p>
  <p> Riker blasts that clone, and it vanishes.</p>
  <p> The doors open, and Granger with three identical armed<br>

    phaser in hand to the empty space which used to hold<br>
    the cloning equipment.</p>

    Doctor, how desperate is the<br>
    colony's situation?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    They've got two maybe three more<br>
    generations, then the fading will<br>
    become terminal. They're the<br>
    walking dead now, they just<br>
    haven't been buried.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I want that cloning equipment<br>
    inspected. Who knows how many<br>
    tissue samples they've stolen.<br>
    I have the right to exercise<br>
    control over my own body.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You'll get no argument from me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know the Mariposan culture seems<br>
    alien, even frightening, but we<br>
    really do have much in common.<br>
    They're human beings fighting to<br>
    survive. Would we do any less?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you saying we should give them<br>
    the DNA samples they require?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (stepping in)<br>
    That's just postponing the<br>
    inevitable. So they get an<br>
    infusion of fresh DNA -- fifteen<br>
    generations and they're back to<br>
    the same problem. Cloning isn't<br>
    the answer. They need breeding<br>
    stock.</p>
  <p> Suddenly all the pieces of the puzzle come together.</p>

    him. As we GO TO:</p>
  <p>46B EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p>47 OMITTED</p>
  <p>48 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard in the command chair, Troi is at his side. Worf<br>
    is at Tactical. Data at OPS. Supernumerary at CONN.<br>
    Riker and Pulaski ENTER from the aft turbolift.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All squared away?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Bringloidi have reached their<br>
    new home.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is unfortunate that we cannot<br>
    remain for several months, and<br>
    observe the integration of the<br>
    two colonies.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    They're going to do just fine.<br>
    They're survivors, both of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've done what we could. We've<br>
    put the cats in the same sack,<br>
    and given it a good shake.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But what is occurring on Mariposa<br>
    is a demonstration of<br>
    sociobiology, and the concept of<br>
    the selfish gene.<br>

  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    Males and females are each<br>
    pursuing their respective<br>
    reproductive strategies in an<br>
    effort to maximize their<br>
    contribution to the gene pool of<br>
    the next generation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, I liked the captain's<br>
    analogy better.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It was more romantic.</p>
  <p> Troi is laughing. Riker is struggling to suppress a<br>
    smile. Data is bewildered.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How are cats in a sack romantic?<br>
    They would fight and scratch<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> Everyone is laughing now.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Very romantic. I hunt in darkness.<br>
    The stars my guide. The memory<br>
    of you sings in my blood. I seize<br>
    the gift.</p>
  <p> The bridge crew is really entranced. Wow, Klingon<br>
    poetry. This is really building to something. What is<br>
    the gift?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Carry it to your bower. And lay<br>
    at your feet the hearts of my<br>
    enemies.</p>
  <p> The silence is deafening. Picard turns slowly back to<br>
    face the main viewscreen. Points at CONN.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
