    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND THE USS REPULSE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise has rendezvoused with the other<br>
    Federation ship near the spectacularly beautiful binary<br>
    system -- Alvacorn Major.</p>
  <p>1A INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttlecraft leaves the Enterprise for the USS<br>
    Repulse.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is not on the bridge. RIKER has the command<br>
    chair - DATA is at Science Station, WESLEY is at Conn<br>
    -WORF is at Tactical. The other positions are filled<br>
    by n.d. crewmembers. Riker watches the Main Viewer as<br>
    the shuttlecraft closes with the Repulse.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies opened.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Repulse, this is the Enterprise.<br>
    We are getting underway.</p>
  <p> REPULSE VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged, Enterprise.<br>
    Transfer complete -- good luck on<br>
    your mission.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And to you.</p>
  <p> REPULSE VOICE<br>
    Give my regards to your captain.<br>
    Repulse out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    The Shuttle Bay is secure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you Mister Crusher. Make<br>
    all preparations to get underway.</p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is there with GEORDI. Geordi is showing Picard<br>
    the plans for a device he is proposing to build.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We will construct this large<br>
    enclosure on Cargo Deck Five.</p>
  <p> The door CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker enters and makes his report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The transfer is complete. Doctor<br>
    Pulaski is being shown to her<br>
    quarters. We are ready to get<br>
    underway.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good. Take a look at the<br>
    containment module our new chief<br>
    engineer has designed.</p>
  <p> Riker steps over.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    &quot;Chief engineer,&quot; that has a nice<br>
    ring to it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It does to me.<br>
    (then to business)<br>
    Each will have total atmospheric<br>
    control... temperature, radiation,<br>
    light, humidity, plus electrical<br>
    spectrums.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And these are put into the large<br>
    containment area?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, these modules will keep the<br>
    specimens alive -- the large<br>
    containment area will keep us<br>
    alive. Now, I have to go and<br>
    replicate this five hundred and<br>
    twelve times. This will mean<br>
    it will be necessary to divert<br>
    power from the warp engines to<br>
    the replicator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will we be on impulse<br>
    power?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    For a few hours, but it can't be<br>
    helped.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When we leave 'aucdet Nine - I'm<br>
    going to want all the power you<br>
    can slam into those warp engines.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You'll have it.</p>
  <p> Geordi exits.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will relieve you at zero three<br>
    zero zero.</p>
  <p> Riker acknowledges and leaves.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as Riker walks back onto the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take us out of orbit, Mister<br>
    Crusher -- set course for 'aucdet<br>
    Nine.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir. Course for 'aucdet Nine<br>
    has been input.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maximum impulse velocity.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it makes a slow graceful turn.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise starts as a dot in the distance -- quickly<br>
    approaches at impulse speed and makes a close passby.<br>
    After a beat, a heretofore unseen speck begins to glow,<br>
    then moves -- chasing after the starship.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the glowing ENERGY closes on the Enterprise. It<br>
    catches the ship and approaches from the rear -- going<br>
    between the warp engines.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Minimal crew. Data is at the Science Station studying<br>
    the display screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Engineering -- this is Science One.<br>
    I just observed what appeared to<br>
    be a random energy transference.</p>
  <p>10 INT. CHIEF ENGINEER'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Geordi is working at the panel on the far wall.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Where?</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aft. Outboard of the port<br>
    nacelle.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hold on -- I'll check.</p>
  <p>10A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to the center console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No -- I show nothing here, Data.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is not satisfied and continues running checks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Problem, Commander?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possibly. An unexplained power<br>
    fluctuation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me know if it reoccurs.</p>
  <p>12 EXT. SPACE - CLOSE ON THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ball of light moves closer to the Enterprise. It<br>
    slides along the skin of the ship; then, without damage<br>
    to the hull, the ball goes inside.</p>
  <p>13 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The corridor is empty. If there were nighttime in<br>
    space, this would be it. The ship is quiet. The<br>
    little glow of energy emerges. It pauses as though<br>
    getting its bearings, then cautiously moves off.</p>
  <p>14 INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We FOLLOW the glow as it continues along. The<br>
    turbolift doors open and TWO CREWMEMBERS exit. The<br>
    glow blends into the corridor wall and neither<br>
    crewmember sees it. The glow falls in behind them as<br>
    they pass.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>15 INT. CORRIDOR - ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At an intersection the crewmembers turn left. The<br>
    energy again pauses, then continues straight ahead<br>
    resuming its journey - or is it a search? The energy<br>
    exits up through the overhead.</p>
  <p>15A OMITTED</p>
  <p>16 INT. CREWMEMBERS' QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The energy enters. It pauses over the sleeping form of<br>
    one of the male crewmembers... then moves away.</p>
  <p>17 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The energy enters the room, passing effortlessly<br>
    through the closed door. It pauses -- again getting its<br>
    bearings. It has a definite sense of purpose as it<br>
    moves slowly toward the sleeping form on the far side<br>
    of the room.</p>
  <p>18 ANOTHER ANGLE - THE BED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We recognize COUNSELOR DEANNA TROI. The energy pauses<br>
    by her head, then LEAVES THE FRAME as it moves down her<br>
    body. We HOLD on Troi's face. After a beat she turns<br>
    -- the restless movements of a tortured dream... sweat<br>
    beads up on her forehead, SUDDENLY she wakes. For a<br>
    moment she does not move -- then she looks around the<br>
    room for the &quot;person&quot; (lover) she knows must be there.<br>
    There is no one. The room is empty. But she knows<br>
    that someone or something has been there and that she<br>
    will never be the same again.</p>
  <p> Off her look of concern... and fear... we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it continues along at impulse speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42073.1.<br>
    There has been an outbreak of a<br>
    yet unclassified Plasma Plague<br>
    in the densely populated Rachelis<br>
    system. We are on an emergency<br>
    run to a Federation Research<br>
    station on 'aucdet Nine, where<br>
    specimens of Plasma Plague are<br>
    kept. We will then transport that<br>
    deadly cargo to Science Station<br>
    Tango Sierra, where hopefully an<br>
    antidote can be manufactured.<br>
    Every hour we delay, thousands<br>
    die.</p>
  <p>20 OMITTED</p>
  <p>20A INT. CARGO DECK FIVE</p>
  <p> In the center of the huge cargo bay, a crewmember is<br>
    assembling a very large containment area which will<br>
    hold the five hundred and twelve modules.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How's it going?</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>
    Finished, just waiting to insert<br>
    the modules.</p>
  <p>21 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard comes out of his Ready Room:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge says we will<br>
    be able to engage the warp drive<br>
    within the hour.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard nods an acknowledgement as he takes his seat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, when we receive a<br>
    complete list of all the specimens<br>
    we will be carrying, I want you<br>
    and Doctor Pulaski to go through<br>
    it... by the way. Where is our<br>
    new doctor? Has she reported in?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not yet.</p>
  <p> Picard is obviously irritated by the breach in<br>
    procedure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sickbay, this is the captain.</p>
  <p> SICKBAY VOICE<br>
    Sickbay, aye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is Doctor Pulaski there?</p>
  <p> SICKBAY VOICE<br>
    (slight hesitation)<br>
    Ah... no, Sir. The doctor is in<br>
    Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?!<br>
    (surprised, then<br>
    annoyed)<br>
    A few hours on board and she's<br>
    already found Ten-Forward.</p>
  <p> Riker starts to rise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll go and get her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Number One. I'll go.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and strides toward the turbolift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not the best way to meet your new<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>22 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Picard exits the turbolift, he encounters Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hello, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a greeting)<br>
    Ensign Crusher.</p>
  <p> Picard continues to stride purposefully down the<br>
    corridor with Wesley a few steps behind trying to keep<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry this mission will delay<br>
    your reunion with your mother.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's all right. I can use the<br>
    time to finish some projects.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dismissive)<br>
    We shouldn't be more than a week<br>
    or so.</p>
  <p> Wesley wants to continue the conversation.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It is going to be hard to leave<br>
    the Enterprise...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mixed feelings for all of us.</p>
  <p> Picard glances back and sees the look of sadness in the<br>
    young man's eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's always difficult leaving any<br>
    ship, as it was for your mother<br>
    when she left to become head of<br>
    Starfleet Medical. But going<br>
    from one assignment to another<br>
    is part of the life which you are<br>
    choosing.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, but this isn't &quot;any&quot; ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Truly.</p>
  <p> Wesley stops and watches Picard continue to<br>
    Ten-Forward. The sadness remains in the young man's<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p>23 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> As Picard enters he crosses with a CREWMEMBER. The<br>
    crewmember's reaction tells us very clearly that Picard<br>
    is not a frequent visitor to Ten-Forward. We FOLLOW<br>
    Picard as he walks over to the BARTENDER. This is the<br>
    first time we get to see this wonderful room.</p>
  <p>24 ANOTHER ANGLE - PICARD AT BAR</p>
  <p> GUINAN is behind the bar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (greets her)<br>
    Guinan.</p>
  <p> She nods a greeting.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where's Doctor Pulaski?</p>
  <p> With a hand motion, Guinan indicates a table.</p>
  <p>25 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard approaches one of the tables. We can see<br>
    that DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI is talking with someone,<br>
    but we cannot see with whom. Picard strides<br>
    purposefully up. Clearly his ire is up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Katherine Pulaski?</p>
  <p> Pulaski looks up.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Ah... you must be Captain<br>
    Picard...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor -- protocol on your last<br>
    assignment might have been lax,<br>
    but here on the Enterprise...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (she abruptly cuts him<br>
    off)<br>
    Sit down, Captain. You better<br>
    listen to this.</p>
  <p>26 ANOTHER ANGLE - TABLE</p>
  <p> We now see that the doctor is with Troi. Picard and<br>
    Troi exchange looks. Picard senses trouble and moves<br>
    a step closer.</p>
  <p>27 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and Worf have assembled. Picard enters<br>
    with Doctor Pulaski and Troi. As he walks briskly<br>
    toward his seat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (he touches his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, status<br>
    report.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    The containment area is completed,<br>
    the last of the modules are being<br>
    inserted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take us to warp six as soon as<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Picard takes his seat and moves on to other -- equally<br>
    urgent business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Doctor Katherine Pulaski.<br>
    We will handle the formal<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The SUBTLE APPRAISALS, the doctor of the crew and the<br>
    crew of the new doctor, are cut short as Picard takes<br>
    his seat and announces.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Counselor Deanna Troi is<br>
    pregnant.</p>
  <p> The reactions of the crew. During what follows we<br>
    will INTERCUT the reactions of everyone. These will<br>
    change as each new piece of information is revealed.<br>
    Data, almost in awe. Life, any life, is amazing to<br>
    him. Riker glances over at Troi and thinks however<br>
    briefly of what might have been. Worf -- suspicious,<br>
    distrustful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A baby!</p>
  <p> Worf is noncommittal, Data curious. Riker surprised,<br>
    and the question is clearly on his mind (whose baby?).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is a surprise.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    More so for me.</p>
  <p> Before Riker can react to that statement, Pulaski takes<br>
    control of the meeting.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    This pregnancy is unlike anything<br>
    I have ever encountered. Since<br>
    she came to me a few hours ago,<br>
    I have made two complete<br>
    examinations of Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> She activates the wall viewer on which appears the<br>
    sonic representation of a healthy, humanoid fetus.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is from the first<br>
    examination. The fetus is about<br>
    halfway through the first<br>
    trimester -- about six weeks old.<br>
    Understand, we...<br>

  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PULASKI (Cont'd)<br>
    (indicating herself and<br>
    Troi)<br>
    ... believe conception occurred<br>
    about eleven hours ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It gets better.</p>
  <p> The screen changes.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The second exam, an hour later<br>
    was consistent, except for the<br>
    fact that the fetus &quot;appeared&quot;<br>
    to be several weeks older.</p>
  <p> She steps away from the screen.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At this growth rate, Counselor<br>
    Troi will have her baby within<br>
    the next thirty-six hours. The<br>
    normal gestation for a Betazoid<br>
    is ten months.</p>
  <p> For a beat, the group is in stunned silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I do not mean to be indelicate,<br>
    but...<br>
    (pause)<br>
    ... who's the father?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Last night, while I slept...<br>
    something... which I can only<br>
    describe it as a presence, entered<br>
    my body.</p>
  <p> Troi turns and looks at the image of the fetus.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A life-form of unknown origin<br>
    and intent is breeding right now<br>
    inside Counselor Troi. Our<br>
    purpose here is to determine what<br>
    is to be done about this very<br>
    &quot;unusual&quot; situation. Discussion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me get this straight -- Deanna<br>
    was impregnated by... by what?<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    Doctor, what do your tests show?<br>
    Is it a humanoid? An alien?</p>
  <p> She stands, goes to the display screen and activates<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's a male human... or in this<br>
    case half-human -- half-Betazoid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Exactly the same as Deanna!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In every way. There is no<br>
    indication from any of my tests<br>
    of any other genetic patterns<br>
    except hers.</p>
  <p>28 TROI</p>
  <p> We HOLD on Troi as she continues to watch the child<br>
    moving inside her. The discussion fades from her<br>
    consciousness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think this is a random<br>
    occurrence. There is a purpose<br>
    here -- a reason. What, I don't<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, obviously the pregnancy<br>
    must be terminated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For the safety of the ship and<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> Troi stares at the moving fetus on the viewscreen.<br>
    Seeing it, alive, helpless, touches other emotions.<br>
    However it was conceived, it is hers. She does not<br>
    completely lose her uncertainty and apprehension, but<br>
    other, stronger instincts begin to emerge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, you can't assume its intent<br>
    is belligerent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is my safest assumption.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, this is a life-form.<br>
    Not to allow it to develop<br>
    naturally would deny us the<br>
    opportunity to study it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If the fetus is aborted,<br>
    laboratory analysis is still<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is there any health risk to<br>
    Counselor Troi if the fetus is<br>
    aborted?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Medically, no.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, is that your<br>
    recommendation?</p>
  <p> As the words swirl around her, she knows in her<br>
    Betazoid heart that the child must be born, and she<br>
    makes her decision. Troi gets everyone's attention.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, do whatever you feel is<br>
    necessary to protect the ship and<br>
    the crew... but know this. I am<br>
    going to have this baby.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts, then:</p>

  <p> coming out of warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    have finally arrived at 'aucdet<br>
    Nine. We will pick up the<br>
    specimens of Plasma Plague and<br>
    transport them to Rachelis.</p>
  <p>30A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> approaching 'aucdet Nine.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It is only because so many lives<br>
    are at stake that I am willing<br>
    to put this ship and crew at such<br>
    great risk.</p>
  <p>31 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is in his command seat, Riker beside him. Data<br>
    is at Ops and Wesley has the Conn. Troi enters from<br>
    the aft turbolift. She is FIVE months pregnant. The<br>
    crew can't help watching as she crosses and takes her<br>
    place next to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How are you feeling?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I should be feeling uncomfortable<br>
    with all the changes in my<br>
    body... but, I'm not. I feel<br>
    fine -- better than fine.<br>
    Wonderful.</p>
  <p> There is a look of concern in his eyes - not only for<br>
    his counselor, but because he still isn't sure what is<br>
    going to be born onto his ship.</p>

    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    'Aucdet Nine, this is Captain<br>
    Jean-Luc Picard of the USS<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> There is a pause, then the viewscreen comes alive.<br>
    A MAN APPEARS. He's dressed in a disposable lab coat<br>
    and wearing a twenty-fourth century medical mask pushed up on<br>
    the top of his head. His name is LIEUTENANT COMMANDER<br>
    HESTER DEALT. INTERCUT VIEWSCREEN WHERE NECESSARY.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Ah... yes... Enterprise you're<br>
    here at last. Good.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excuse me, to whom am I speaking?</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Oh... I'm Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Hester Dealt. The medical trustee<br>
    of the Federation Medical<br>
    Collection Station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are the specimens ready for<br>
    transfer?</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Yes, but with your permission I<br>
    would like to inspect the<br>
    containment area before we<br>
    proceed. It is not that I doubt<br>
    the ability of your crew; we just<br>
    cannot afford a mistake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate your caution -- in<br>
    the same vein, I need a complete,<br>
    detailed manifest of everything<br>
    which you intend to bring on board<br>
    my ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    I will allow access to the<br>
    computer banks.</p>
  <p> The screen returns to a view of 'aucdet Nine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Download the inventory and go<br>
    through it with Doctor Pulaski.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Number One, arrange to have Hester<br>
    Dealt transported up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I'm suddenly feeling a<br>
    little tired. I'll be in my<br>
    quarters if you need me.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Troi gets slowly up and walks to the<br>
    turbolift. Picard watches her leave. In the b.g. Worf<br>
    also watches. He is still very uneasy.</p>
  <p>32 INT. TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> She steps up to her sink. She touches her face with a<br>
    wet cloth as she studies her image in the mirror. The<br>
    emotional strain of this event is etched on her<br>
    features. She looks down at her swollen body....</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It won't be long now. Soon<br>
    you'll arrive and so many<br>
    questions will be answered.</p>
  <p> The thought makes her smile.</p>
  <p>33 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around 'aucdet Nine.</p>
  <p>34 INT. CARGO HOLD FIVE</p>
  <p> Hester Dealt continues his inspection on the<br>
    containment area, which is a very large rectangular<br>
    object suspended off the floor of the Cargo Deck. It<br>
    has a very sophisticated monitoring system for the<br>
    hundreds of compartments within.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    This is very good. Exactly what's<br>
    needed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I just followed your instructions.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Good. Exactly what I wanted.</p>
  <p> Hester moves around the containment area -- over -- under<br>
    -- up -- down -- inspecting it from every possible angle.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Five hundred and twelve<br>
    compartments. Individually<br>
    controlled. Very good.<br>
    Independent of one another.<br>
    Perfect. Ah, they can be<br>
    monitored from here. And,<br>
    isolation is assured. Very, very<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wanted to be sure they wouldn't<br>
    get out.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Good, Lieutenant. Very good<br>
    indeed.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    How's it coming, Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    It will be just a little while<br>
    longer. I want to go over it<br>
    again in more detail.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It will be another couple of<br>
    hours, Commander.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    You do understand, it's critical<br>
    that we have zero growth.</p>

    It's been fourteen hours since<br>
    we arrived at 'aucdet Nine.<br>
    Hester Dealt is making final<br>
    selections of the specimens we<br>
    will carry. Meanwhile, we<br>
    continue to receive desperate<br>
    pleas from the Rachelis System.</p>
  <p>35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is finishing up something at Science One.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, the final manifest has<br>
    been received.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At last. Review it with Doctor<br>
    Pulaski. I want both of you to<br>
    be completely familiar with it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Data leaves Science One and crosses to the turbolift.</p>
  <p>36 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The turbolift doors open and Data steps into the<br>
    corridor. As he turns toward Sickbay he sees Troi,<br>
    walking with some difficulty. He quickly goes to her<br>
    aid.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Data -- help me get to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> He offers his arm for support and together they<br>
    continue along.</p>

  <p>38 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> It's Troi and Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's time.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh, you bet it is. Let's get you<br>
    into Sickbay.</p>
  <p> As she helps Troi through Sickbay, Data touches his<br>
    communicator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Worf -- assemble your security team<br>
    in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Is that necessary?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes -- captain's orders.</p>
  <p> He then follows them into Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Strange to need armed guards in<br>
    the delivery room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, and strange to think my child<br>
    is the cause.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Before you referred to it as &quot;the<br>
    child,&quot; now it's become your<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, whatever his beginnings,<br>
    that's what he's become.</p>
  <p> They exit Sickbay.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>39 INT. SICKBAY - MATERNITY</p>
  <p> They enter and Pulaski leads Troi to the bed. Her<br>
    MEDICAL ASSISTANTS move to prepare for the delivery.<br>
    Data comes up behind them.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How frequent are your<br>
    contractions?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Very close together.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In all my other deliveries -- with<br>
    a couple of exceptions -- the<br>
    father was present.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Difficult under the circumstances.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's unfortunate you have to go<br>
    through this alone. It helps to<br>
    have someone with you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I could serve in that<br>
    capacity. I can quickly review<br>
    the procedures I will be required<br>
    to execute.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Troi is going to need the comfort<br>
    of a &quot;human&quot; touch... Not the cold<br>
    hand of technology.</p>
  <p> Data reaction.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Doctor. I think Commander Data<br>
    will do nicely.</p>
  <p> A look from the doctor to Troi and back to Data.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Your choice.</p>
  <p>40 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There is nothing specific you have<br>
    to do, Data, you just have to be<br>
    with me.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    There is nothing to be nervous<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is very interesting to me.<br>
    Although I understand in technical<br>
    terms how life is formed, there<br>
    is still a part of the process<br>
    which eludes my understanding.<br>
    I began my existence as an adult.<br>
    I have no memory -- no cognizance<br>
    of conception, birth, childhood,<br>
    so to be allowed to witness this<br>
    event is...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    It's happening.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Doctor!</p>
  <p> Pulaski steps over.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    This is an impatient baby. He's<br>
    eager to make his appearance.</p>
  <p> She picks up her hypospray.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll give you something for the<br>
    pain. It won't in any way<br>
    diminish the experience.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have felt no pain.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    None?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... none at all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>40A INT. CORRIDOR - ENTRANCE TO SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Worf and SECURITY TEAM arrive.</p>
  <p>41 ANOTHER ANGLE - SICKBAY</p>
  <p> They now have Troi in position in the birthing chair.<br>
    Worf and the security team enter and take up their<br>
    positions as Pulaski and her Assistant prepare for the<br>
    delivery.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Have your security team stand over<br>
    there. I understand the need to<br>
    have you here, but keep out from<br>
    under foot.</p>
  <p>42 AND NOW THE BIRTH (INTERCUT THE PIECES OF THE<br>
    EVENT)</p>
  <p> This is more than just the wondrous act of life. It<br>
    has as well the added tension of Worf and his security<br>
    team. Data, and his first close encounter with<br>
    creation of the thing he understands least -- life. As<br>
    this sequence begins, Riker appears in the background.<br>
    He stands to the side -- out of the way, but there in<br>
    case his friend, Deanna Troi, needs him.</p>
  <p> WE WILL LAY THIS OUT, BASED ON HOW A CHILD IS<br>
    BORN ON THE TWENTY-FOURTH CENTURY ENTERPRISE.</p>
  <p> And the CHILD comes out -- Worf edges closer -- the<br>
    doctor takes it to one side. Ties the cord, cleans<br>
    it, and brings it back to Troi. This is an effortless<br>
    birth -- no pain -- no strain.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Are easy births the norm for<br>
    Betazoids?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not according to my mother.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (as she hands it to<br>
    Troi)<br>
    It's a boy. A normal, healthy,<br>
    six pound, three ounce baby boy.</p>
  <p> Then to Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT TWO 26.</p>

    (continuing; without<br>
    any edge)<br>
    You can come the rest of the way<br>
    in now.</p>
  <p> Worf enters and approaches the baby as he would a<br>
    deadly snake.</p>
  <p>43 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Worf and the newborn exchange looks.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No threat here, Lieutenant, you<br>
    and your men can relax... it's<br>
    just a baby.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts.</p>
  <p>44 TROI</p>
  <p> as she holds the baby. Data leans in to see the child.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was remarkable. Thank you for<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker now steps forward to pay his respects. He leans<br>
    down and kisses her on the forehead.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Have you been here all along?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (then just for her)<br>
    He's beautiful, Deanna... just<br>
    like his mother.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I don't think you are going to<br>
    be needed here, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Worf nods an acknowledgement and leads his security<br>
    team off. Riker and Troi exchange looks and he too<br>
    exits.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Fine. Absolutely wonderful and<br>
    thank you, Doctor... for<br>
    everything.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome to the bridge, Doctor.<br>
    How's Counselor Troi? Did she<br>
    have a good night?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I have delivered dozens of babies.<br>
    But none like this. There was<br>
    no pain, no trauma. It was<br>
    effortless for both of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not sure of your point.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    She had the baby yesterday. If<br>
    I were to examine her now, I would<br>
    not be able to tell that she just<br>
    had a baby, or ever had a baby.<br>
    It's as though the incident never<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    How long before we are ready to<br>
    begin the transfer?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Two hours, nineteen minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (he stands)<br>
    You have the Conn, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, you would accompany me,<br>
    please. I think it's time I paid<br>
    my respects.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CORRIDOR - ENTRANCE TO TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Pulaski approach the doorway. The CHIME<br>

  <p> Troi's back is to him. She is doing something with her<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wanted to come by and see how<br>
    you were and have a look at<br>
    your...</p>
  <p> At this moment the CHILD looks out from around Troi.<br>
    It is already THREE YEARS OLD!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... baby! My goodness.</p>
  <p> The Doctor takes out her medical recorder and does a<br>
    quick body scan of the child.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How old is he?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In actuality a day.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    ... In appearance, almost four<br>
    earth years old.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ian, say hello to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You mean he can talk?</p>
  <p> The boy answers.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Picard is stunned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello, Ian.</p>
  <p> Picard moves closer.</p>

    Don't worry. Everything is fine.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    are faced with two major problems:<br>
    Troi's child and the deadly cargo<br>
    we are about to load, which is<br>
    so desperately needed in the<br>
    Rachelis system. In the hours<br>
    since his birth, Troi's baby has<br>
    continued to age and now appears,<br>
    physically and mentally, to be<br>
    a child of eight. And still there<br>
    is no indication as to who he is,<br>
    or why he is here.</p>

  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    We need a little more time. It's<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My name. It is pronounced Data.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (with a wry smile)<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You called me Data.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What's the difference?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One is my name and the other is<br>
    not.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Is this possible?</p>
  <p> Data is puzzled by the apparent non sequitur. Pulaski<br>
    stands, picks up her medical recorder, steps over to<br>
    Data and begins a body scan.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In all of your neural nets,<br>
    algorithms, and heuristics, is<br>
    there some combination which makes<br>
    up a circuit for bruised feelings?</p>
  <p> Data looks confused.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Apparently so, because I think<br>
    I just offended your tender<br>
    sensibilities.</p>
  <p> She looks at the puzzled Data.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Possible?</p>
  <p> Then with an amused look, gets back to business.</p>

  <p> Data steps around and examines the screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It indicates a genetically<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    About twenty percent of the<br>
    specimens fall into that category.<br>
    (to herself)<br>
    Some eager beaver at play.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Query... &quot;eager beaver?&quot;</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In this case, 'eager beaver'<br>
    refers to some overachieving<br>
    genetic engineer, who probably<br>
    for lack of something better to<br>
    do forced this strain of virus<br>
    to mutate, just to see how bad,<br>
    bad can get.<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>

    risks we are about to take...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enlighten me.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    If the most innocuous specimen<br>
    on the manifest list gets loose,<br>
    it will destroy all life on the<br>

  <p>51 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand, Doctor. Do you have<br>
    a recommendation?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Considering how desperately this<br>
    is needed, no I don't. Just want<br>
    you to know what we're carrying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Doctor. Commander<br>
    Data, if you have completed your<br>
    review, you are needed in<br>
    Transporter Room Three.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    Excuse me, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That's okay...<br>
    (with long A, then short<br>
    A)<br>
    Data, Data... whatever.</p>
  <p> He gives the doctor a look. Doctor Pulaski returns to<br>
    her viewscreen.</p>
  <p>52 INT. CHILDREN'S PLAY AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi is standing by the door with the TEACHER (MISS<br>
    GLADSTONE). They are watching a GROUP OF KIDS playing<br>
    with a half a dozen puppies. Sitting right in the<br>
    middle of everything and playing with abandon is IAN,<br>
    WHO IS NOW ALMOST EIGHT. Troi is enthralled by the<br>
    actions of her &quot;son.&quot;</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ian!</p>
  <p> The boy looks up and smiles when he sees his mother.<br>
    Then he notices a LITTLE GIRL next to him. Ian takes<br>
    his hands off the puppy, and puts them (without any<br>
    sense of threat, just curiosity) on the girl's hair.</p>
  <p> MISS GLADSTONE<br>
    He's a very tactile child. He<br>
    wants to touch and feel<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Come on, sweetheart, time to go.</p>
  <p> Ian scrambles to his feet and trots over to his mother<br>
    and gives her a big hug.</p>
  <p> MISS GLADSTONE<br>
    Unbelievable -- I think he's<br>
    actually grown since you dropped<br>
    him off.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    I like it here, Mommy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I thought you would. Thank Miss<br>
    Gladstone for having you, and<br>
    let's go get you something to eat.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    (to the teacher)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Ian then turns and waves to the other kids who are<br>
    still involved with the puppies.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Bye...</p>
  <p> Some of the other children wave -- most are too involved<br>
    in what they are doing to notice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (also to the teacher)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Miss Gladstone nods an acknowledgement, then watches<br>
    them leave. Her eyes reflect the amazement she feels<br>
    about Troi's unusual child.</p>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I wanted to stop by and see how<br>
    Ian was doing.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We're doing fine. I was just<br>
    going to give Ian his supper.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>

    Do you want your supper now, too?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Ian, but thank you for the<br>
    invitation.</p>

  <p> IAN<br>
    You're welcome.</p>
  <p> A spoon which Ian is playing with more than using,<br>
    slips out of his hand and falls on the floor. Picard<br>
    retrieves it.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Have you ever played with puppies?</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Troi for an explanation. Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They had a litter today in the<br>
    nursery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, I have never played with<br>
    puppies.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    You'd like it. You should go<br>
    to the nursery while the puppies<br>
    are still there.</p>
  <p> PICARD.<br>
    Perhaps later.</p>
  <p> Troi puts the boy's supper down in front of him. It<br>
    includes some hot steaming soup. Picard and Pulaski<br>
    watch as Ian examines his food. He tries to touch the<br>
    steam coming off the soup, then feels the wetness on<br>
    his little fingers. Everything connected with his<br>
    physical senses fascinates the child. He sticks his<br>
    hand into the hot soup and holds it there for a beat:</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    (pulling it out)<br>
    Ouch...</p>
  <p> He looks at his scalded fingers. Tears well up in his<br>
    eyes and like any other child his age; he runs to his<br>
    mother.</p>

    Let me look at that.</p>
  <p> Ian holds out the fingers and watches with great<br>

    the pocket of her smock to medicate the fingers.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's not serious.</p>
  <p> Ian studies his fingers as he realizes the pain is<br>
    gone. Then he touches his cheek and feels the tears.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    My face is wet.</p>
  <p> Troi gently dries his tears with the tips of her<br>
    fingers, then lovingly strokes his hair.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is it better now, sweetheart?</p>
  <p> The boy nods and cuddles in against his mother.</p>

    He allowed himself to be burned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, for the experience.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>

    does he want?</p>

  <p> He watches the child intently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ian, could you tell us why you<br>

    I live here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ian, the captain wants to know<br>
    if you are ready to tell us why<br>
    you came here.</p>
  <p> IAN<br>
    No. Not yet.</p>
  <p> Ian picks up the glass, which unlike the soup, this is<br>
    cold.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The answer is within him. When<br>
    his cognitive powers develop<br>
    sufficiently, he will be able to<br>
    articulate it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope he will tell us soon.</p>
  <p> He takes some of the liquid into his mouth... rolls<br>
    it around, swallows some, and lets the rest run down<br>
    his chin. Picard watches as Ian pours some of the<br>
    liquid onto his leg just to know how it feels, then<br>

    time you've asked me.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's what I'm expected to do.<br>
    Don't you always do what's<br>
    expected?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I try to.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sometimes. Sometimes you have<br>
    to consider others more than<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's true. But sometimes the<br>
    game is to know when to consider<br>
    yourself more than others and to<br>
    give yourself permission to be...<br>
    selfish.</p>
  <p> He looks at her. Then -- before he can answer, the<br>

    We can't do that either. It will<br>

    would be disastrous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> HESTER<br>
    The rate of growth is increasing.<br>
    Within thirty minutes it will push<br>

  <p> Hester inputs the freestanding viewscreen, and the<br>
    HISTORY OF &quot;L-SEVEN-THREE&quot; APPEARS. Pulaski looks<br>
    at it.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's a mutated strain developed<br>
    by Doctor Susan Nuress during an<br>
    outbreak of Plasma Plague seventy<br>
    years ago in the Oby System.<br>
    (she pauses as she<br>
    continues to read)<br>
    It was number nine in a series<br>
    of tests. This particular one<br>
    bombarded by low levels of Eichner<br>
    radiation.<br>
    (then she turns to<br>
    Hester)<br>
    Could exposure to Eichner<br>
    radiation stimulate growth?</p>
  <p> As a reflex act, Hester Dealt makes a sweep of the area<br>
    with his handheld monitor.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Yes, it could, but...</p>

    Uh, oh...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Don't tell me.</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>

    Eichner radiation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't you catch it before?</p>
  <p> HESTER<br>
    Because it wasn't here before..</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Well, it is now. What emits that<br>
    type radiation?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A subspace phase inverter.</p>

  <p> as Pulaski leads the others to Troi's quarters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's Ian. Please... please hurry.</p>
  <p> Pulaski moves quickly to the unconscious child; pulls<br>
    back the covers. She removes an instrument from her<br>
    smock and makes a scan of the child's body. In the<br>
    b.g., Picard enters with Riker and Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Save him, you must save him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What happened? Did he eat<br>
    anything? Did he fall?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Data, using his tricorder, confirms with a nod to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The child is the source of the<br>
    unusual radiation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He said he's the reason the ship<br>
    is in danger.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That analysis is correct.</p>
  <p> Pulaski injects the child with hypospray.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm losing life signs.</p>
  <p> Troi stands by helplessly. Like any mother in this<br>
    situation, she is beyond grief. Tears streak her face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, please. Please save him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>82 PULASKI</p>
  <p> resets the injector and again she administers a dose<br>
    of hypospray. She waits for a reaction. There is<br>
    none.</p>
  <p>83 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room is very quiet. Pulaski stands.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Troi moves next to the cot on which the child is lying.<br>
    She is beyond despair. Her heart has completely<br>
    broken. The others allow her a moment alone, then as<br>
    Riker is about to move to Troi's side, a LIGHT -- the<br>
    glowing energy which we saw at the beginning -- gathers<br>
    from within the child and slowly rises. As it does,<br>
    the body that was Ian fades away until there is only<br>
    the LIGHT.</p>
  <p>84 INTERCUT REACTIONS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects<br>
    the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her.<br>
    As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow.<br>
    Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through<br>
    the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines<br>
    from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the<br>
    essence of the entity before her and she knows now why<br>
    he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure<br>
    love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a<br>
    dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave.<br>
    Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall<br>
    of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat.</p>

    Apparently so.</p>
  <p> Troi pauses, gathering her feelings and picking her<br>
    words carefully. She settles her emotions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is a life-force entity... as<br>
    we passed each other in space he<br>
    was curious and wanted to know<br>
    about us, and he thought the best<br>
    way to learn was to go through<br>
    the process. To be born, to live<br>
    as one of us and in that way to<br>
    understand us.</p>
  <p> She pauses, then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, he never meant any harm.</p>
  <p> Picard nods -- he knows that is true.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There was a moment when you<br>
    smiled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (she smiles again)<br>
    He said thank you.<br>
    (she pauses)<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No, before I do that, I wanted<br>
    your permission to stay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wes, it's a little more<br>
    complicated than that.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, for right now... this<br>
    is where I want to be. This is<br>
    where I feel I belong.</p>
  <p> Picard studies the young man for a beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain -- transfer complete. We<br>
    are ready to leave orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Number One.<br>
    (then to Wesley)<br>
    Return to your position.</p>
  <p> Wesley hesitates a beat because he still hasn't<br>
    received an answer.</p>
  <p>89 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard -- followed by Wesley -- comes on to the bridge.<br>
    Troi steps off the turbolift and takes her place.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All stations secure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take us out of orbit, Mister<br>
    Crusher and lay in a course for<br>
    the Morgana Quadrant.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard takes his seat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (loud enough for<br>
    everyone to hear)<br>
    Mister Crusher has requested to<br>
    remain on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not surprised. How did you<br>
    respond?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I haven't as yet, Number One.<br>
    I don't think it's my decision<br>
    alone. His remaining will cause<br>
    difficulties for us all.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, indeed. With his mother not<br>
    around, who will see to his<br>
    studies?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly. That duty would fall<br>
    to Commander Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And, who'll tuck him in at night?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Come on, Commander.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will accept that responsibility.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, we know he'll get his sleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, Number One, that leaves you<br>
    the task of guiding young Mister<br>
    Crusher through his most hazardous<br>
    journey -- from youth to man. Are<br>
    you willing to serve?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Difficult question...</p>
  <p> Wesley turns and looks at Riker with a plea in his<br>
    eyes. INTERCUT look between them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... Yes, I think I can do that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right then. Mister Crusher,<br>
    communicate with your mother at<br>
    Starfleet Medical headquarters.<br>
    Give her my regards and tell her<br>
    you have my permission to remain<br>
    on board the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> There is a big smile on Wesley's face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But, that I will abide by her<br>
    wishes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir... thank you sir... I<br>
    just know she'll agree.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Child&quot; - 9/20/88 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now -- if you have course and speed<br>
    laid in.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (back to duty)<br>
    Yes sir, they are.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, Mister Crusher -- engage.</p>
  <p>90 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves off to its next assignment.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
