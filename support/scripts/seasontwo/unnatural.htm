    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> EXT. DEEP SPACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The USS ENTERPRISE moves through the galaxy at warp<br>
    speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42303.7.<br>
    The Enterprise is bound for Star<br>
    Station India to rendezvous with<br>
    a Starfleet courier.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The lights on the bridge are down, with only the OPS<br>
    and CONN stations illuminated. An n.d. crew goes quietly<br>
    about it's business.</p>
  <p> NOTE: THIS DIALOGUE HAS TO BE REWRITTEN:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Hopefully the mission will<br>
    provide an opportunity to<br>
    evaluate our newest staff<br>
    officer...</p>
  <p> INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A pensive CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD paces restlessly,<br>
    pausing in front of the antique brass ship's barometer<br>
    mounted on the bulkhead.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    In the short time she's been<br>
    aboard, Doctor Pulaski has<br>
    distinguished herself as a<br>
    meticulous and competent<br>
    physician. But can someone so<br>
    focused on her own specialty also<br>
    assume the broader duties of the<br>
    ship's Chief Medical Officer?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Absently, Picard raps the barometer's face plate with<br>
    his knuckle. Surprisingly, the needle moves --<br>
    pointing to &quot;STORMY.&quot;</p>
  <p> INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> COMMANDER RIKER, GEORDI and several male crewmembers<br>
    from Engineering are seated around a table near the<br>
    bow ports. The center of attention is clearly the new<br>
    Specialist Trainee, RINA, an arrestingly beautiful<br>
    young woman.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    ... warp drive theory always came<br>
    easy for me, but I'm looking<br>
    forward to some hands on<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure we'll be able to<br>
    accommodate you.</p>
  <p> Rina is well aware that Riker is flirting with her,<br>
    but she's not flattered. She concentrates on finishing<br>
    her drink.</p>
  <p> Geordi, on the other hand, seems oblivious to the<br>
    tension.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I know what you mean. It's a<br>
    really electrifying experience<br>
    to be down there where the action<br>
    is. Whenever I push the drive<br>
    past warp six I still get a lump<br>
    in my throat.</p>
  <p> Riker takes Rina's empty glass from her hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (standing)<br>
    Can I get you another?</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Tell me Commander. Is it the<br>
    custom on the Enterprise for the<br>
    First Officer to wait on<br>
    trainees?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    If they were all like you, I'm<br>
    certain it would be.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Rina)<br>
    What's it like these days at the<br>
    academy? Is Tsiolkovski still<br>
    teaching Propulsion Theory?</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Are you kidding? They'll have<br>
    to tear down the building around<br>
    him. The first time I saw him...</p>
  <p> MOVE WITH RIKER as he heads for the bar carrying two<br>
    empty glasses. He slides them across the bar to an<br>
    n.d. bartender.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Same again.</p>
  <p> In the b.g. we see DOCTOR KATHERINE PULASKI leave her<br>
    table and approach Riker.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Good to see you, Commander. When<br>
    you missed your test this morning<br>
    we all feared the worst.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (turning)<br>
    My apologies, Doctor. A minor<br>
    crisis...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    in Engineering.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (not buying it)<br>
    You know, a Rheinman tissue<br>
    sample sounds a good deal worse<br>
    than it is. I can assure you<br>
    there's no discomfort involved.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's not that! It's just... my<br>
    duties are so diverse.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Suppose we leave the appointment<br>
    open?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Spontaneity is the sand in the<br>
    clockworks of science.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But it's just an unimportant<br>
    detail...</p>
  <p> A raised eyebrow from Pulaski tells Riker this is a<br>
    dead-end.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    If I didn't consider it important<br>
    I wouldn't insist. Don't force<br>
    me to relieve you of duty to make<br>
    my point.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You can't be --<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'll work something out. But<br>
    my schedule is tight for the next<br>
    three or four days...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    So I see.</p>
  <p> They both glance toward the table where Rina and Geordi<br>
    are still in conversation.</p>
  <p> BEYOND THE PORTS the stars streak toward us at warp<br>
    speed.</p>
  <p> Rina has a clear view.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Beautiful, isn't it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S POV -- He &quot;sees&quot; the ship's navigational<br>
    shield as a gossamer scrim of shimmering color, and<br>
    beyond, countless waves of energy bursting from<br>
    exploding suns.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The most beautiful thing I know.</p>
  <p> ON RINA as she turns to face him. She's not used to<br>
    hearing men talk like this.</p>
  <p> INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard stands in the darkness, his face bathed in<br>
    starlight. He's staring out the port at the same view<br>
    that facinates Rina.</p>
  <p> A CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> COM PANEL VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    Captain, this is the bridge.<br>
    We're receiving a distress signal<br>
    on an open sub-space frequency.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Sound emergency stations, and<br>
    respond on the same frequency.</p>
  <p> Picard rushes for the door.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The great ship sweeps past at warp speed.</p>
  <p> INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> ENSIGN WESLEY CRUSHER emerges from the turbolift<br>
    adjusting his uniform and rubbing the sleep from his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> WE FOLLOW as he stops at the food slct, grabs a cup<br>
    of tea, and moves to replace the n.d. crewmember at the<br>
    CONN.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (O.S.)<br>
    (from com panel)<br>
    Sickbay on full emergency<br>
    status, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard is on his feet with Riker and COUNSELOR TROI<br>
    next to him. COMMANDER DATA is at the OPS station and<br>
    WORF is at TACTICAL.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by, Doctor. Commander<br>
    Data. Have we locked on to the<br>
    signal yet?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. A voice only<br>
    transmission from the USS<br>
    Lantree, a Federation supply<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    Lantree, this is Jean-Luc Picard<br>
    of the USS Enterprise. What<br>
    is the nature of your emergency?</p>
  <p> A long beat of silence as they wait anxiously for a<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> VOICE (V.O.)<br>
    (from viewscreen)<br>
    -- can't hold out any -- dying<br>
    -- too many -- help ...<br>
    (silence)</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf glance at each other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, we are still recieving their<br>
    signal. There is simply no<br>
    message.</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Picard's worried expression.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to viewer)<br>
    Lantree! Are you under attack?</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Underway at warp speed.</p>
  <p> INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and the others are at their stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    USS Lantree, this is the<br>
    Enterprise, come in, Lantree.</p>
  <p> Nothing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Replay that last transmission.</p>
  <p> The Lantree's last desperate call is replayed.</p>
  <p> VOICE (V. O.)<br>
    (from viewscreen)<br>
    -- can't hold out any -- dying<br>
    -- too many -- help ...<br>
    (silence)</p>
  <p> PICARD (CONT.)<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Great stress is all I'm able to<br>
    sense.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Have we got a fix on her?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Two point two milli-parsecs,<br>
    bearing three-zero at one-four-<br>
    five degrees.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We better take a look.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    What vessel is it?</p>
  <p> Data accesses the computer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    USS Lantree, a class R Starfleet<br>
    supply ship assigned to Gamma<br>
    seven seven, Captain L.I. Taleka<br>
    commanding. Normal complement,<br>
    twenty-six officers and crew.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Armed?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Class three defensive only.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is she still underway?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed. She is at maximum speed.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker glance at each other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Alter course to intercept.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (enters course)<br>
    Course to intercept.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Execute.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Let's go to Yellow Alert.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yellow Alert, sir.</p>
  <p> The KLAXONS SOUND.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engineering?</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> KLAXONS continue as the crew moves to alert stations.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Engineering.</p>
  <p> Geordi replaces an n.d. crewmember at the command console.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (from com panel)<br>
    Give us maximum warp.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maximum warp, sir.<br>
    (to crew)<br>
    Let's show 'em what we've got.</p>
  <p> The crew springs to action. Rina is electrified.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (CONT.)<br>
    (to Rina)<br>
    Go to the backpanels and give<br>
    me a direct reading of the<br>
    dilithium temperature spread.</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINE ROOM</p>
  <p> Rina enters...</p>
  <p> And up on the catwalk, one of the crewmember is distracted<br>
    by her; he trips, and tumbles over the railing onto<br>
    the main deck.</p>
  <p> The automatic ALARM SOUNDS. Rina and several others<br>
    rush to the man's aid. His leg is broken.</p>
  <p> Geordi runs in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>
    My fault, sir. Missed the turn.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks up at the catwalk, then down at the<br>
    crewmember. Then he looks at Rina.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (pained)<br>
    Ensign... maybe you better stay<br>
    in the control room.</p>
  <p> Rina recoils as if she'd been slapped. But she says<br>
    nothing. Wounded, she gets to her feet and exits.</p>
  <p> EXT. ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> In the distance is the USS Lantree, underway at warp<br>
    speed. The Enterprise is closing on her slowly.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The bridge crew is at stations. On the viewscreen is<br>
    the Lantree.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lantree, this is the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD (CONT.)<br>
    Captain Telaka, this is Picard,<br>
    USS Enterprise. Do you read me?</p>
  <p> Only the EMPTY WHISTLING TONE of the Lantree's carrier<br>
    signal answers. The bridge crew is uneasy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No life signs, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This could be an ambush.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Force fields up. Arm photon<br>
    torpedoes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Force fields up.</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>
    Torpedoes armed and ready.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Red alert.</p>
  <p> The KLAXONS SOUND.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont.)<br>
    What else have we got in the<br>
    neighborhood?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No other vessels of any kind<br>
    within two parsecs.</p>
  <p> The Lantree is now larger in the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No battle damage.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All systems seem functional,<br>
    Captain. Everything is in perfect<br>
    order.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And no life signs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No life signs.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're going to have to board her,<br>
    Will.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and the much smaller Lantree streak<br>
    along together at warp speed.</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Riker talks to Geordi. Rina is here as well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The only way we can wind up in<br>
    the same starfield is if you<br>
    bring us out of warp speed at<br>
    precisely the same instant as<br>
    the Lantree.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    First I have to get control of<br>
    the her engines. Very tricky.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's why we gave you the job.<br>
    (friendly pat)<br>
    Let me know as soon as you're<br>
    set.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Will I be on the away team?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (aware of Rina)<br>
    Too dangerous for a valuable man<br>
    like you.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Fortunately, first officers are<br>
    expendable.</p>
  <p> He starts out, then turns to Rina.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont.)<br>
    Just in case we don't make it<br>
    back...<br>
    (kisses her hand)<br>
    It was a pleasure.</p>
  <p> He exits.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to the crew.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll man the bridge station.<br>
    Our first problem is to gain<br>
    control of the Lantree's drives.<br>
    (to Rina)<br>
    Come on. You'll get a chance<br>
    to see what the bridge is like<br>
    on alert.</p>
  <p> Her eyes widen.</p>
  <p> INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The first team is on the bridge as Geordi enters,<br>
    followed by Rina.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ready to give it a try, Captain.</p>
  <p> Geordi sits at the console with Rina watching over his<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    First we have to download the<br>
    Starfleet access codes for the<br>
    Lantree...<br>

  <p> Not even Picard is immune to Rina's beauty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Ensign?</p>
  <p> Rina is flattered at being noticed by the captain, but<br>
    she's still trying to keep an eye on what Geordi is<br>
    doing.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps you'd like to take a look<br>
    from down here.<br>
    (indicates the area<br>
    in front of the<br>
    viewscreen)</p>
  <p> Frustrated again; but she has no choice.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf, Riker, Data and a couple of n.d. crewmembers are<br>
    preparing to be transported.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're going in amidships<br>
    protected by an isolation<br>
    forcefield. We'll take one quick<br>
    look. Fifteen seconds. If we<br>
    don't like what we see, we beam<br>
    back immediately.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    (from com panel)<br>
    We have a lock on the Lantree,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Okay, let's drop out of warp<br>
    speed. And see if you can keep<br>
    us in the same galaxy.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and the Lantree travel side by side.</p>
  <p> AS THE TWO SHIPS DROP OUT OF WARP SPEED, they wind up<br>
    separated by some distance.</p>
  <p> INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and his team are ready.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (V.O.)<br>
    (from com panel)<br>
    Sorry about that. We got as<br>
    close as we could.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's okay, Geordi. What's a<br>
    light year among friends?</p>
  <p> Riker turns to the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If it looks secure at first<br>
    glance, we'll proceed to the<br>
    bridge.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If we find anyone alive, the<br>
    medical team will beam over.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Set phasers for kill.</p>
  <p> They set phasers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's do it.</p>
  <p> The controller touches the panel and they beam away.</p>
  <p> INT. USS LANTREE</p>
  <p> The away team materializes adjacent to the central<br>
    computer. Phasers at the ready, they find no one in<br>
    sight.</p>
  <p> Data plugs a memory module into the computer, touches<br>
    a few buttons, then takes the module with him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have the ship's logs, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker scans the area. He glances at Worf.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's see if anbody's home.</p>
  <p> Cautiously, they open the door to the adjacent area.<br>
    It's empty.</p>
  <p> INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf emerges. He checks the corridor. Still no one<br>
    in sight. Riker, Data and the others follow him out.</p>
  <p> Slowly they move on. They come to the sickbay door.<br>
    Worf opens it, glances in--and freezes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Every bed contains a body. Worf guards the entrance<br>
    as Data scans the bodies with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How's the environment?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No abnormal viral or bacterial<br>
    forms.</p>
  <p> Riker goes to the nearest bed and looks at the dead<br>
    crewmember's face. The man is wrinkled and ancient.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They were carrying passengers?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is not a passenger. He is a<br>
    crewmember.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But he's nearly two hundred years<br>
    old!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It would seem they all are.</p>
  <p> Riker looks around the room in astonishment. The other<br>
    corpses are equally antique.</p>
  <p> Riker looks from one to the other in horror.</p>
  <p> They back away.</p>
  <p> INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The door opens and there is Worf at the ready with his<br>
    phaser. Data and Riker enter the room.</p>
  <p> CAPTAIN TELAKA is sprawled across his desk, face down.<br>
    His hand still holds a communications device. Riker<br>
    looks down at it. The hand is thin, bony, and<br>
    wrinkled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How old was Captain Telaka?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thirty-two earth years.</p>
  <p> Riker reaches down and gently turns Telaka's head--knowing<br>
    what to expect, and still shocked by what he<br>
    sees.</p>
  <p> The face is withered, and the transparent skin is<br>
    stretched over a toothless skull.</p>
  <p> INT. LANTREE BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker enters, phaser at the ready.<br>
    Worf and Data follow him in.</p>
  <p> At the CONN station, a crewmember is slumped over the<br>
    console. Like the others, he is wrinkled and ancient.</p>
  <p> Grim, Riker moves to the console and touches a panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enterprise... this is the USS<br>

  <p> Picard appears on the viewscreen.</p>

    Captain, the entire crew has been<br>
    wiped out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> Riker looks down at the corpse of the toothless hag<br>
    in the first officer's chair.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It looks like they were in a<br>

    Chief medical officer's log.<br>
    Extensive autopsies performed<br>
    on the crew of the Lantree reveal<br>
    a gamut of primary organ failures<br>
    as the direct cause of death.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY</p>
  <p> One of the ancient looking Lantree corpses is lying<br>
    on a platform surrounded by a forcefield. The platform<br>
    moves slowly through a twenty-fifth century CAT scanner<br>
    as Dr. Pulaski and her assistants study the readouts<br>
    with growing frustration.</p>

  <p> The corpse sparkles briefly then disappears. One of<br>
    the technicians touches a control panel and the area<br>
    inside the forcefield is flushed with an electric blue<br>
    light. Then the protective field is dropped.</p>

    they all died of natural causes.</p>

    Natural causes? What in nature<br>

  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    For the record Captain, these<br>
    people died of old age.</p>
  <p> Data, at the OPS station, enters a query into his<br>
    console, and swivels to face Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, according to the Lantree<br>
    logs the oldest crew member was<br>
    seventy-three, and the mean age<br>
    of the crew was thirty-two point<br>

    Every member of the Lantree crew<br>
    had a complete examination at<br>
    the beginning of their last duty<br>
    cycle just eight weeks ago.<br>
    (glances at Riker)<br>
    They were in perfect health.</p>

    Nothing since then? No geriatric<br>
    symptoms reported?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    A single medical entry noting<br>
    that the first officer was<br>
    treated for Thelusian flu five<br>
    days ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thelusian flu?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    An exotic, but harmless rhinal<br>
    virus. And there was no evidence<br>
    of infection in the first<br>
    officer's autopsy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we don't know what we're<br>
    looking for, how can we be<br>
    certain the Lantree is safe?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We can't. We'll have to assume<br>
    whatever caused this is still<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> Picard clenches his jaw.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf. You know what<br>
    to do.</p>

    At the very least they deserve<br>
    a warning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Geordi approaches the maintenance table where Rina is<br>
    working on an exotic piece of equipment about the size<br>
    of a basketball. Two enthralled ENGINEERING CREWMEMBERS<br>
    are watching her work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> RINA<br>
    Yes, sir!</p>
  <p> Rina lifts the unit off the table. The two crewmembers<br>
    rush to help her carry it -- and the delicate device<br>
    is knocked from Rina's hands. Geordi lunges and<br>
    manages to catch it inches from the deck. Slowly he<br>
    gets to his feet, trying to check his anger.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> The embarrassed crewmembers begin packing up the test<br>
    equipment as Rina follows Geordi into the corridor.</p>

  <p> RINA<br>
    Don't bother, I've heard it all<br>
    before. It's not your problem,<br>
    anyway. It's me.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and studies her. He doesn't need to &quot;see&quot;<br>
    her face to read the disappointment in her voice. It<br>
    makes what he has to say next even harder.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's right. You've got plenty<br>
    of aptitude, but you're<br>
    attitude's not makin' it.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    What do you know about my<br>
    attitude? How'd you like it if<br>
    people always behaved as if<br>
    you're some kind of freak?!</p>

    to human genetics. I assure you<br>
    we're not dealing with some<br>
    mutated pathogen that &quot;got away<br>
    from us.&quot; We believe the<br>

    Doctor, we encountered The<br>

  <p> MANDEL<br>

    These children are more than our<br>

    isn't telling us the whole truth.<br>
    I recommend caution.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The two children could be encased<br>

    that worth some risk?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're always at risk, Doctor.<br>
    You may proceed with your<br>
    examination, but I shall demand<br>
    positive proof that these<br>

    placing the lives of my crew in<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    These children are in better<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    It takes time to get to know him.<br>

  <p> INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> The A-team is assembled. Picard has the floor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Pulaski's studies indicate<br>
    the children are harmless. She<br>
    believes the rest of the colony's<br>
    children should be beamed aboard<br>
    and transported to a new<br>
    environment while there's still<br>
    time to save them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you sure they're safe?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> A murmer of alarm.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (CONT.)<br>
    In the time we have available,<br>
    the only true test is to expose<br>
    the children to another human<br>
    being.</p>
  <p> An audible silence. Everyone is looking at her.</p>

    You would risk yourself?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    They're living beings and they<br>
    need our help.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    I don't like it. If we lost the<br>
    force field for some reason...<br>
    we could lose the ship.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    But the children are in perfect<br>
    health. And we can use double<br>
    redundant forcefields.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As Geordi says, forcefields can<br>
    fail. And until --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Captain, I can understand your<br>
    concern, but --</p>
  <p> She's cut him off again. She glances at him. Picard<br>
    eyes her coolly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You say you understand, Doctor,<br>
    but I wonder if you do.</p>
  <p> Pulaski is up against a wall. She stares at the table<br>
    with a hand to her forehead. Picard studies her. He<br>
    softens.</p>
  <p> PICARD (CONT.)<br>
    If you can find a way to prove<br>
    the children are biologically<br>
    harmless without risking the<br>
    crew, I'll do everything in my<br>
    power to assist.</p>
  <p> She nods. She gets up and heads for the exit. Picard<br>
    motions to Troi. The two of them hold back until the<br>
    others are gone.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm concerned about our CMO.<br>
    (off Troi's look)<br>
    She's absolutley obsessed with<br>
    the medical viewpoint. She<br>
    doesn't seem able to step back<br>
    and see the overall picture.</p>
  <p> Troi has trouble suppressing a smile.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What's the matter?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nothing, Captain. Perhaps you<br>
    and the CMO just need to give<br>
    each other a little more time.</p>
  <p> INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Pulaski strides onto the bridge and addresses the<br>

    Mandel is visibly older.</p>

  <p> MANDEL<br>
    How can that be?!</p>
  <p> Pulaski stiffens her spine to carry the weight.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The risk to our ship and crew<br>
    is too great. Until we're<br>
    absolutely certain of the cause<br>
    of the disease, the children --</p>

  <p> She's angry. She's about to reply, but she's<br>
    interrupted by Pulaski, who comes storming into the<br>
    control room.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I need your help. I've got very<br>
    little time. I've got to find<br>
    a way to test the children, to<br>
    make sure they're harmless. And<br>
    I need a fail-safe environment.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The problem is, there's no area<br>

    I'm afraid that's out of the<br>

    to the same quarantine as the<br>

    The medical emergency at Darwin<br>

    continue to assist, but our<br>
    immediate concern is the<br>
    evacuation of our two officers.<br>
    Anyone?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Shouldn't Kate be involved in<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Judging from what we saw on the<br>

    I suggest transporting them both<br>

    the best medical resources<br>
    available.</p>

    Precisely. We can't protect<br>

    isn't bio-dependent.</p>
  <p> They ponder. Finally,</p>

  <p> Everyone turns to Rina, their faces reflecting degrees<br>
    of skepticism.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The transporter trace?</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    The transporter keeps a computer<br>
    record of every transmission,<br>
    a footprint if you will. Usually<br>
    it's only stored for security<br>
    purposes, but if we used the<br>
    trace data to control the<br>
    reconstitution process...</p>

    Is that possible?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> He exits with Data.</p>
  <p> Rina is dumbstruck. She looks at Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Hop to it Ensign. You've got<br>
    work to do.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard enters and addresses the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Darwin Station, this is the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> On the viewscreen, Pulaski appears -- now well over<br>
    100 years old. Picard tries to keep his emotions under<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    We may have come up with an<br>
    answer, Doctor. We're looking<br>
    for a sample of your normal DNA<br>
    to use as a filter. We think<br>
    we'll be able to transport you<br>
    while cancelling out any changes<br>
    that have taken place.</p>
  <p> INT. DARWIN ISOLATION LAB</p>
  <p> Pulaski and Mandel stand before the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    An interesting idea, Captain.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But what about Doctor Mandel and<br>
    her colleagues?</p>
  <p> MANDEL<br>
    Kate.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If this works -- we may be able<br>
    to use the same technique to save<br>
    ourselves. We have DNA samples.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Data frantically search the medical records.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A blood test or tissue specimen<br>
    -- anything that would provide<br>
    a sample of Pulaski's original<br>
    DNA.</p>
  <p> They've been through everything.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Afraid not, sir. Her records<br>
    were shipped by way of Starfleet<br>
    headquarters. They haven't<br>
    caught up with us yet.</p>
  <p> Riker is stupefied.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is ridiculous.<br>
    (slams his fist)<br>
    A single cell! A single --</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a beat -- then dash for<br>
    the exit.</p>
  <p> INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker and Data race for Pulaski's quarters. The door<br>
    is locked. Riker speaks to the com panel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    This is an emergency! Unlock<br>
    Medical Officer Pulaski's<br>
    quarters!</p>
  <p> COM PANEL (V.O.)<br>
    Riker, William T., relieved of<br>
    active duty on<br>
    two-three-four-six-nine-point-seven...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (embarrassed)<br>
    Allow me, sir.</p>
  <p> INT. PULASKI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker and Data rip the place apart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Anything! Even a fingernail<br>
    clipping!<br>
    (looks at Data)<br>
    Or a hair!</p>
  <p> He lunges for the dressing table. There, on her<br>
    hairbrush, is a single blonde strand.</p>
  <p> They dash for the exit.</p>
  <p> INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard addresses Pulaski on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor... you should know. This<br>
    has never been done before. Are<br>
    you willing to chance it?</p>
  <p> INT. DARWIN LABORATORY.</p>
  <p> Every movement is now painful for Pulaski.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to viewscreen)<br>
    I'll tell you one thing. If I<br>
    live through this...<br>
    (bends elbow and<br>
    flinches in pain)<br>
    I'll have a much better<br>
    understanding of geriatrics.<br>
    (weak smile)<br>
    Standing by, Captain.</p>
  <p> INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Several of the panels are off, technicians are all over<br>
    the place, and Rina is supervising the modification<br>
    of the circuitry. Geordi, Riker and Data are making<br>
    last minute adjustments to the control console.</p>
  <p> Picard enters, followed by Worf.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Ready, Captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The isolation forcefield is in<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> Picard surveys the scene.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'll operate the transporter<br>
    myself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That's not necessary, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid it is. If something<br>
    should go wrong. If Doctor<br>
    Pulaski is not fully... restored.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    Then she's still capable of<br>
    contaminating the ship.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    In that event there should be<br>
    time to redirect the transporter<br>
    and... disperse her. It's not<br>
    a responsibility I can delegate.</p>
  <p> Picard steps to the control panel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't worry, Captain. It's not<br>
    going to come to that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You seem to have absolute faith<br>
    in the ensign's work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (glances at Rina)<br>
    Like I said, she's never wrong.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well, then.<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Engage forcefield.</p>
  <p> The isolation forcefield rises around the transporter<br>
    platform.</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont.)<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    Doctor Pulaski, are you ready?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (from com panel)<br>
    I suppose I --</p>
  <p> Picard touches the panel. His eyes narrow as he<br>
    focuses on the empty transporter platform. Everyone<br>
    is holding their breath.</p>
  <p> Rina looks at Geordi anxiously.</p>
  <p> In the transporter bay, Pulaski's form appears... STILL<br>
    AGED! Then it fades... then re-materializes.</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf glance at each other.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> Picard reaches out, his hand poised above the controls.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> On the transporter platform Pulaski's energy field<br>
    sparkles one last time -- she begins to coalesce --<br>
    and all signs of aging have disappeared.</p>
  <p> Pulaski, seeing Picard, can't suppress a flicker of<br>
    admiration.</p>
  <p> Picard, too, has trouble concealing his admiration.</p>
  <p> The forcefield is dropped. Picard steps forward and<br>
    extends his hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Everyone rushes to welcome the CMO back.</p>
  <p> And Riker is ready -- anxious -- to bite the bullet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor... I'm ready to take the<br>
    Rheinman test.</p>
  <p> Pulaski looks at him quizzically. Has she forgotten?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Glad you reconsidered, Commander.<br>
    (to com panel)<br>
    This is Chief Medical Officer<br>
    Pulaski. Commander Riker is<br>
    restored to active duty effective<br>
    immediately.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    My schedule's a little tight.<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    What do you say we put it off<br>
    for a day or so?</p>
  <p> Picard is at the doorway. Pulaski catches up with him,<br>
    and they exit together.</p>
  <p> INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Pulaski and Picard step into the lift.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Captain... If this hadn't<br>
    worked? If...</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (clears his throat)<br>
    It would have been necessary to<br>
    beam your energy into empty<br>
    space.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Happily, there's no reason to<br>
    concern yourself with --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Why should I be concerned about<br>
    having my atoms spread across<br>
    the galaxy? I imagine that's<br>
    what's going to happen every time<br>
    I use the damn thing.</p>
  <p> Picard's smile turns to laughter.</p>
  <p> INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Geordi and Rina are walking together.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Looks like you'll be going to<br>
    your next assignment with a<br>
    captain's commendation in your<br>
    record.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Thanks to you. And the way<br>
    you... see things.<br>
    (turns to him)<br>
    Tell me. When you look at me,<br>
    what do you see?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To me beauty is a constantly<br>
    changing thing. Sometimes people<br>
    have it and sometimes they don't.<br>
    It all depends on their energy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I see your energy and it's<br>
    beautiful. But it comes from<br>
    within.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    You're the only poetic chief<br>
    engineer I've ever heard of.</p>
  <p> CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And you're the most able trainee<br>
    I've ever met.<br>
    (kisses her hand)<br>
    To quote our first officer, &quot;It's<br>
    been a pleasure.&quot;</p>
  <p> He looks up, but she's still holding his hand.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Technically, I'm off duty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Technically, so am I.</p>
  <p> They have arrived at the entrance to her room. They<br>
    look at each other for a moment.</p>
  <p> RINA<br>
    Maybe you'd like to come in.<br>
    I've got a fabulous collection<br>
    of antique star drive drawings.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sounds riveting.</p>
  <p> The door opens. They enter.</p>
  <p> As the door closes, we see her arms encircle him, and<br>
    they kiss.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise moves away from Gagarin IV.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Course and speed set for Star<br>
    Station India, Sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> The great ship clears Gagarin system and disappears<br>
    in a flash of light.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT:</p>
  <p> THE END </p>
