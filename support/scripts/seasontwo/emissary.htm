    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> RIKER, PULASKI, GEORDI, DATA, and WORF, in that order,<br>
    sit around the table playing poker. By far, Worf has<br>
    the biggest stack of chips.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (eyeing his cards)<br>
    Lookin' good. I say... five.</p>
  <p> Riker throws in five chips. Pulaski meets the bet.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Five here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (adding chips)<br>
    And five more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (evaluating)<br>
    I believe the wiser course of<br>
    action here is to bend.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You mean fold.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. Fold -- to bend,<br>
    make compact or give in.</p>
  <p> Data lays his cards on the table. All eyes on Worf.<br>
    Worf calmly counts the right amount of chips and puts<br>
    them in the pile. Then he adds two more large stacks<br>
    of chips.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I raise fifty.</p>
  <p> Everyone is taken aback.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe Lieutenant Worf<br>
    understands all the nuances of<br>
    this betting procedure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/14/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't be too quick to judge, Data.<br>
    His pile's a lot bigger than<br>
    yours.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Than all of ours.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The cards have been favoring the<br>
    Lieutenant, but that is the result<br>
    of random chance... hence it is<br>
    a temporary condition.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You hope.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Talk or play. Not both.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks it over.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fifty, right?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Fifty is the bet. What's the<br>
    matter -- are your feet getting<br>
    cold?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, just my cards...</p>
  <p> He bets, somewhat less sure of himself.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Thanks for staying in -- I need<br>
    the chips.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Got to earn them first.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh, I will. This pot has my name<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Talk, talk, talk...</p>
  <p> Pulaski bets.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/14/89 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Here's some action. Fifty...<br>
    (adds more)<br>
    ... and another fifty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (backpedalling)<br>
    Fold, fold, fold...</p>
  <p> Geordi throws in his hand. Worf pushes out four<br>
    stacks of chips and adds another two.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your fifty, and fifty more.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at Worf and at Pulaski -- who stare at each<br>
    other. Pulaski smiles but Worf is deadpan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Love to stay in -- but not with<br>
    these cards.</p>
  <p> Riker folds.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Looks like it's just you and me,<br>
    handsome.</p>
  <p> Worf is a statue. Pulaski gathers up the needed<br>
    amount. It takes every last chip she has, but --</p>
  <p> PULASKI (cont'd)<br>
    I'll see you.</p>
  <p> Pulaski pushes in the needed amount. Everyone stares<br>
    at Worf as he slowly puts down his cards. A full house<br>
    -- aces over queens.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (cont'd)<br>
    Beats my straight.</p>
  <p> Everyone except Worf SIGHS as the tension is released.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Iceman wins again.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You took my last chip. You could<br>
    at least smile, Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf says nothing; he simply pulls in all the chips<br>
    and stacks them, preparing for the next hand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Smiling might break his<br>
    concentration.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    If you don't enjoy winning -- what<br>
    do you enjoy? Losing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'd be happy to accommodate you.</p>
  <p> Worf, unruffled, collects the cards and hands them to<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your deal.</p>
  <p> Data takes the cards, shuffles them like an old pro,<br>
    and deals.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The game is seven card stud; after<br>
    the queen, one-eyed jacks and low<br>
    card in the hole are wild.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let me write this down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just deal. I'd like to get some<br>
    of my losings back before the next<br>
    century.</p>
  <p> Pulaski and Geordi CHUCKLE.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I open with fifty.</p>
  <p>1A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A moment of stunned silence -- broken by:</p>

  <p> FEMALE COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Commander Riker. We<br>
    are receiving a class eleven<br>
    emergency signal from Starfleet<br>
    Command.</p>
  <p> Instantly, the players throw their cards onto the<br>
    table, get to their feet --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> -- and head for the door. As they cross:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Fifty? You were bluffing.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons never bluff.</p>
  <p> Geordi gives Worf a look of uncertainty -- is Worf<br>
    kidding? -- as the group EXITS.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS from the Ready Room. At Conn is a young<br>
    female: ENSIGN CLANCEY. Riker, Data, and Worf ENTER<br>
    and take their stations; Data relieves the<br>
    supernumerary at Ops, examines readouts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Emergency signal reads as follows:<br>
    Enterprise to divert to<br>
    coordinates four-two-three by<br>
    one-one-two by five-one<br>
    immediately. Further orders<br>
    forthcoming.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's it? What's the emergency?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The message does not elaborate.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving at high warp.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, and Ensign Clancey as<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our destination is a point near<br>
    the Boradis system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That area was colonized fairly<br>
    recently, as I recall.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The first Federation outpost was<br>
    established thirty-four years ago<br>
    on Boradis Three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And since then, the Federation<br>
    has colonized several planets in<br>
    that sector.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yet we are not headed for a<br>
    specific colony. The coordinates<br>
    given are outside the Boradis<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any problems reported in that<br>
    area?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    None.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then what the devil's going on?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, Starfleet Command is<br>
    hailing us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's about time. On screen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6A ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as ADMIRAL GROMEK appears on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    Greetings, Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My compliments, Admiral Gromek.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    Captain, you'll soon be joined<br>
    by a Federation special emissary<br>
    from Starbase one five three.<br>
    We're now transmitting the<br>
    specifics.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Data, who's checking readouts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods to Picard)<br>
    We are receiving.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    The rendezvous will be a bit<br>
    tricky, so it's imperative you<br>
    reach the intercept point on<br>
    schedule.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood. And -- the mission?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    The envoy will fill you in. You<br>
    are to cooperate fully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you give me any details?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    Negative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I find it difficult to<br>
    prepare for a mission I know<br>
    nothing about.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK<br>
    (softening)<br>
    I sympathize, Jean-Luc, but<br>
    Starfleet Command considers this<br>
    a top-security matter.</p>
  <p> The admiral permits herself a thin smile.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL GROMEK (cont'd)<br>
    After the envoy's briefed you,<br>
    I think you'll understand our<br>
    caution. Gromek out.</p>
  <p> Gromek's image VANISHES from the viewscreen.</p>
  <p>7 OMITTED</p>
  <p>8 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, what ship is carrying the<br>
    envoy?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The envoy is not aboard a<br>
    starship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently there were no starships<br>
    available at Starbase<br>
    one five three. The emissary is<br>
    aboard a class eight probe.</p>
  <p> Surprised reactions from the group.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A class eight probe is just over<br>
    two meters long!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinking)<br>
    True, Number One. But if the<br>
    sensors and transmitters were<br>
    removed and life-support<br>
    installed, there would be just<br>
    enough space for one person.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And those probes are designed to<br>
    go warp nine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    By sending the probe to meet us<br>
    rather than diverting the<br>
    Enterprise to the starbase, they<br>
    have saved us six point one hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Obviously Starfleet feels that<br>
    time is of the essence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, but still... to seal someone<br>
    up inside a Class Eight Probe and<br>
    then just launch it off...<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Hell of a way to transport a<br>
    Federation dignitary.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Clancey)<br>
    We'll need an intercept course<br>
    with pin-point accuracy. The<br>
    probe carrying the emissary has<br>
    no means of navigation...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (finishing the thought)<br>
    ... so if we don't catch it on the<br>
    first try, we'll have to chase<br>
    it.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> zooming along at high warp.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Geordi is now at his bridge Engineering<br>
    Station; O'BRIEN is looking over Geordi's shoulder.<br>
    The two of them study readouts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data -- if we project our course<br>
    past the rendezvous coordinates,<br>
    what lies ahead?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As far as I can determine, sir<br>
    -- very little. There are four<br>
    colonies in the Boradis system,<br>
    and nine other outposts scattered<br>
    throughout the sector.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, we have a way to save<br>
    you some time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I believe we can beam the probe<br>
    aboard while we're still<br>
    travelling at Warp Nine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a low whistle)<br>
    Quite a trick.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right -- at warp speed it's<br>
    nearly impossible to get a solid<br>
    transporter lock. But if we<br>
    caught the probe with a tractor<br>
    beam...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (catching on)<br>
    We could use the tractor beam to<br>
    focus the transporter.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Risks?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    None to the emissary. There's<br>
    a chance the probe could break<br>
    free... then we'd have to find<br>
    it and start over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So it's a gamble.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Odds, gentlemen?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Twenty to one it'll work.</p>
  <p> O'Brien nods agreement. Picard makes up his mind:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> CLANCEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p> Inside the probe is a person whose face we cannot see<br>
    -- the head is fully covered by an oxygen helmet.<br>
    Pulaski does a medical scan, is surprised at the<br>
    readings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something wrong, Doctor?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm not sure. The readings are<br>
    quite... interesting.</p>
  <p> Pulaski is about to help the envoy sit up -- but the<br>
    envoy, not needing help, waves Pulaski aside, sits up,<br>
    removes the oxygen helmet, and emerges from the probe<br>
    casing.</p>
  <p>30 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> on the envoy -- K'EHLEYR, a lovely, exotic woman,<br>
    half-Klingon, half-human, with the appearance and<br>
    physical strength of the former and the sardonic wit of<br>
    the latter.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I greet you. I am K'Ehleyr.</p>

  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    You speak Klingon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A little. I am Commander Riker,<br>
    and this is our chief medical<br>
    officer, Katherine Pulaski.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr nods greeting.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    I hope your voyage wasn't too<br>
    unpleasant.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Klingons are not supposed to mind<br>
    hardship.<br>
    (breaks into a smile)<br>
    Nonetheless -- I'm delighted to<br>
    be out of that damned coffin.</p>
  <p> Riker can't help smiling in return.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/17/89 - ACT ONE 16.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't blame you.<br>
    (re the probe)<br>
    Not the most luxurious<br>
    accommodations Starfleet has to<br>
    offer...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Whoever said that getting there<br>
    is half the fun never rode in<br>
    a class eight probe.</p>
  <p> Under this, Pulaski has repeated the medical scan.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How are you feeling? Your vital<br>
    signs are rather atypical for a<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    No doubt because I am only half<br>
    Klingon.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Yes. My father was Klingon; my<br>
    mother was human.</p>
  <p> Riker and Pulaski react. This is one interesting<br>
    lady...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>31 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, TROI, Worf, and Data. The turbolift doors OPEN<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, I'd like to present<br>
    Special Federation Emissary<br>
    K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard. I'm Jean-Luc<br>
    Picard.<br>
    (introducing)<br>
    Counselor Troi, Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Data, and --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT ONE 16A.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard turns to introduce Worf -- and a big grin<br>
    spreads across K'Ehleyr's face.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Worf! So this is where you've<br>
    been hiding. I told you we'd meet<br>
    again!</p>
  <p> Worf is anything but pleased to see K'Ehleyr. His<br>
    surprise turns to resentment.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    Aren't you going to greet me?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have nothing to say to you.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Haven't changed a bit, eh? Well,<br>
    I missed you, too.</p>
  <p> On the surprised faces of our crew -- and the indignant<br>
    face of Worf, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>32 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Streaking across space at warp eight.</p>
  <p>33 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, and Data are at the<br>
    conference table. K'Ehleyr is all business.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Two days ago, Starbase three three six<br>
    received an automated<br>
    transmission from a Klingon ship,<br>
    the T'Ong.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    That ship was sent out over<br>
    seventy-five years ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When the Federation and the<br>
    Klingon Empire were still at<br>
    war...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    The message was directed to the<br>
    Klingon High Command. It said<br>
    only that the T'Ong was returning<br>
    home and was about to reach the<br>
    &quot;awakening point.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which suggests that the crew was<br>
    in cryogenic sleep for most of<br>
    the long voyage.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And when the crew is revived...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    ... we'll have a ship full of<br>
    Klingons who think the war is<br>
    still going on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/12/89 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So our task is to find the ship,<br>
    and tell the Klingons we are no<br>
    longer at war.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why us? A Klingon ship would have<br>
    been a better choice.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    A Klingon ship -- the P'rang --<br>
    is on its way, but it's two days<br>
    behind us. That may be too late.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why too late?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Because the T'Ong's crew is about<br>
    to awaken within striking range<br>
    of a dozen Federation outposts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are thirteen colonies<br>
    with minimal defenses in that<br>
    sector...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Nice ripe targets for a Klingon<br>
    warship.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you believe you can convince<br>
    these Klingons that humans are<br>
    now their allies?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    No. Not a chance.</p>
  <p> Everyone is surprised.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    If you ask me, talking will be<br>
    a waste of time. Klingons of that<br>
    era were raised to despise humans.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    We'll try diplomacy. But I<br>
    promise you -- it won't work.<br>
    And then you'll have to destroy<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Everyone is taken aback -- except Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (calmly)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    No? Captain, these Klingons are<br>
    killers. You'll have no choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Find me another choice. I want<br>
    some options -- and I want them<br>
    before we encounter the Klingon<br>
    ship.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Lieutenant, I'm assigning you to<br>
    help the emissary. Dismissed.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr smiles, but Worf is anything but pleased.</p>
  <p>34 OMITTED</p>
  <p>35 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Riker, Troi, K'Ehleyr, and Data get to their feet.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to K'Ehleyr)<br>
    I'll escort you to the guest<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> Troi and K'Ehleyr EXIT, followed by Data and Riker.<br>
    Worf and Picard are the last ones to leave. Worf is<br>
    uncharacteristically hesitant. Picard picks this up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir... I suggest Commander Riker<br>
    or Data would better serve Special<br>
    Emissary K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are there personal reasons you<br>
    don't want the assignment?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any professional reasons?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Worf a measured look: &quot;need I say more?&quot;<br>
    Worf thinks it over, then:</p>
  <p> WORF (cont'd)<br>
    I withdraw my request, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS.</p>
  <p>36 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi and K'Ehleyr walk, deep in conversation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't know it was possible<br>
    for a human and a Klingon to<br>
    produce a child.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Actually, the DNA is compatible<br>
    -- with a fair amount of help.<br>
    (a grin)<br>
    Rather like my parents.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know exactly what you mean.<br>
    My father was human... and my<br>
    mother was Betazoid.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (brightens)<br>
    Really! It was the other way<br>
    around for me -- my mother was<br>
    human.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You must've grown up like I did<br>
    -- trapped between cultures.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I never felt trapped -- I felt<br>
    fortunate. I experienced the<br>
    richness and diversity of two<br>
    worlds.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (shakes her head in<br>
    wonder)<br>
    Perhaps you got the best of<br>
    each...</p>
  <p> They reach the guest quarters.</p>
  <p>37 INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Troi leads K'Ehleyr into the chamber.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Myself, I think I got the worst<br>
    of each.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    I doubt that.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Oh, yes. Having my mother's sense<br>
    of humor is bad enough -- it's<br>
    gotten me into plenty of trouble.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And your Klingon side?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    That, I keep under tight control.<br>
    It's like a terrible temper --<br>
    it's not something I want people<br>
    to see.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why hide it? We all have<br>
    tempers...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Not like mine. Sometimes I feel<br>
    there's a monster inside me,<br>
    fighting to get out.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And that frightens you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT TWO 22A.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Of course it does. My Klingon<br>
    side can be terrifying... even<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yet it gives you strength. It's<br>
    part of you.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That doesn't mean I have to like<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles in return.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>38 INT. TACTICAL ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf is alone, sitting at a library computer. K'Ehleyr<br>
    breezes in. She's freshened up, changed clothes, and<br>
    is even more attractive than before. Worf, all<br>
    business, doesn't even look at her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are late.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Sorry. Had to make myself<br>
    beautiful.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I fail to understand why.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Worf, we're alone now. You don't<br>
    have to act like a Klingon<br>
    glacier. I don't bite...<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    ... well, that's wrong; I do bite.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (ignoring)<br>
    Shall we proceed with our assigned<br>
    duties?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (moving closer)<br>
    I haven't even had a proper<br>
    welcome.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I would prefer to keep this<br>
    professional.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (gives it right back)<br>
    &quot;I fail to understand why.&quot;</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And I feel no need to explain.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (needling)<br>
    Oh, go ahead. Tell me. It's<br>
    because you find me irresistible,<br>
    isn't it? You always have.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Did you come on board the<br>
    Enterprise to work, or to discuss<br>
    your pointless fantasies?</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr smiles. She's getting under his skin.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    You just won't open up, will you?<br>
    Come on -- what happened to the<br>
    Worf I met on Samrin's Planet?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He became a Starfleet lieutenant.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Oh, is that it? Starfleet Academy<br>
    turned you into a robot? You<br>
    won't make me believe that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have no wish to make you believe<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Perhaps you have changed. You<br>
    weren't this aloof six years<br>
    ago... or don't you remember?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is nothing wrong with my<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Well, there's something wrong with<br>
    the rest of you. You're not even<br>
    looking at me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am familiar with your<br>
    appearance.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    And it gives you no pleasure to<br>
    see me again?</p>
  <p> Worf is silent.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    It isn't as if we tried it and<br>
    it didn't work, you know. You<br>
    never gave it a chance.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/17/89 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I never?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (sly)<br>
    I mean, as I see it, we have<br>
    some... unfinished business, you<br>
    and I.</p>
  <p> Worf turns, looks her full in the face.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not as far as I'm concerned.</p>
  <p>39 ON K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> It's as if he slapped her face. Worf turns back to<br>
    the console, punches up a screen:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    According to the library computer,<br>
    the captain of the T'Ong is<br>
    K'Temoc. But there is nothing<br>
    regarding the ship's mission.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (indifferent)<br>
    So?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You're not interested in why the<br>
    ship was sent out?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    Probably some secret military<br>
    objective.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps, but we have no evidence<br>
    of that --</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Why else would there be no record<br>
    of the mission?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The records may simply have been<br>
    lost.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/17/89 - ACT TWO 25A.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    In any case, what does it matter?<br>
    Our concern is the present -- the<br>
    possible threat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And to contend with that threat,<br>
    we need information.</p>
  <p> They're both getting irritated with one another.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    We have all the information we<br>
    need.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is foolish. Knowing their<br>
    mission might help us understand<br>
    them --</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (cutting him)<br>
    There's nothing to understand!<br>
    They're Klingons! They'll attack!<br>
    In their minds, we're the enemy<br>
    -- and there's no way we're going<br>
    to talk them out of that!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Oh, are there? Tell me: whatever<br>
    happened to that wonderful<br>
    Klingon fatalism of yours?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My experience aboard this ship<br>
    has taught me that most problems<br>
    have more than one solution.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>

  <p> K'Ehleyr storms into the chamber, boiling with<br>
    frustration. She stops in the center of the room,<br>
    tries to regain control over herself -- clenching her<br>
    fists and tensing all her muscles.</p>
  <p> But her Klingon half needs release -- and with one<br>
    sudden blow, K'Ehleyr smashes her fist through a<br>
    glass-topped table.</p>

    You're upset.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (heavy sarcasm)<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Well -- that, and the table.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr can't help a CHUCKLE.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I warned you about my Klingon<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    May I make a suggestion?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    I thank you, Counselor. But I<br>

    we should be in scanner range in<br>
    fifteen hours, eight minutes.</p>
  <p> Under Data's speech, Worf has ENTERED and moved to<br>
    Tactical. The tactical crewman yields the position<br>
    to him. Worf begins operating Tactical in a flurry of<br>
    activity. Picard is surprised to see Worf on the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Special Emissary K'Ehleyr has...<br>
    declared a short recess, sir.<br>
    I wish to run a full diagnostic<br>
    test on all tactical back-up<br>
    equipment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    We just ran a full test of those<br>

  <p> WORF<br>

    I feel it necessary to check them<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant, I commend your<br>
    diligence. However, I'm concerned<br>
    that you're working yourself too<br>
    hard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, considering the unknown<br>
    elements we are about to face --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (cuts him off)<br>
    Lieutenant -- I order you to<br>
    relax.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (tense)<br>
    I am relaxed.<br>
    (on his look)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf EXITS. The tactical crewman takes over the<br>
    station. Picard crosses to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've never seen the Lieutenant<br>

  <p>48 INT. HOLODECK - BATTLEGROUND</p>
  <p> Twilight. A shattered, desolate terrain. Rocks,<br>
    ruins, shadows. K'Ehleyr, cat-like, moves silently<br>
    through it. She's alert, coiled, ready for anything.<br>
    She's wearing a Klingon glove/weapon similar to the one<br>
    worn by Worf in &quot;Where Silence Has Lease.&quot;</p>
  <p> Then, seemingly from nowhere, a massive ALIEN WARRIOR<br>
    springs into view, charges at K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p>49 ON K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> calmly dodging the alien's blow and smashing the side<br>
    of her fist into the alien's face. The alien SNARLS<br>
    and attacks again.</p>
  <p>50 ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> standing on the sidelines and watching with interest.</p>
  <p>51 ON K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> as the alien tries to get an arm around her throat.<br>
    K'Ehleyr slams an elbow into its midriff, follows up<br>
    with a lightning punch. The alien, unfazed, catches<br>
    K'Ehleyr with a blow to her side.</p>

  <p>54 WIDER</p>
  <p> as K'Ehleyr goes berserk. Her speed doubles; her blows<br>
    become less &quot;scientific&quot; and more brutal. The Klingon<br>
    warrior in her has taken over.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr dodges an alien blow, jabs with all her<br>
    strength -- her fist SMASHES the alien in the face.<br>
    The alien topples like a tall tree.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>58 ON K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> A long beat as she and Worf gaze at each other. He's<br>
    seen a side of her -- her Klingon side -- that she lets<br>
    no one see, and she's uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> Then, K'Ehleyr breaks the eye contact, shrugs with<br>
    indifference:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    It's not much of a program.</p>
  <p>59 ON WORF</p>
  <p> The barest hint of a smile.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Computer. Level Two.</p>
  <p>60 WIDER</p>
  <p> as suddenly the &quot;dead&quot; alien Warrior is back on its<br>
    feet, joined by TWO MORE ALIEN WARRIORS; all three are<br>
    brandishing gleaming, razor-edged swords.</p>
  <p> On a nearby rock are two swords; Worf and K'Ehleyr pick<br>
    up the swords as the aliens ROAR and attack --</p>
  <p>61 ANGLE ON THE FIGHT</p>
  <p> Everything we've seen is tame compared to what follows.<br>
    Worf and K'Ehleyr turn into fighting machines --<br>
    vicious, snarling animals whose only goal is survival.</p>
  <p>62 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf and K'Ehleyr are a blur. Blades flash and CLANG.<br>
    The aliens drop, unable to withstand the dual<br>
    onslaught. One alien is literally sliced in half.</p>
  <p> And, almost before it's begun, it's over -- Worf and<br>
    K'Ehleyr are the only ones left standing.</p>
  <p>63 ON WORF AND K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> sweaty, breathing hard, covered with grime -- but<br>
    triumphant.</p>
  <p> Slowly, swords still in hand, Worf and K'Ehleyr turn<br>
    toward one another -- eyes hard, expressions ferocious,<br>
    blood still boiling.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>64 WIDER</p>
  <p> as Worf quite deliberately tosses his sword aside.<br>
    K'Ehleyr raises hers in defense -- but Worf is already<br>
    upon her, gripping her sword-arm.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr struggles, but Worf is stronger -- inexorably<br>
    bending her arm back and making her drop the sword.</p>
  <p>65 OMITTED</p>
  <p>66 ON K'EHLEYR</p>
  <p> eyes ablaze in challenge and defiance. Worf locks his<br>
    gaze to hers. They're almost nose to nose. A long<br>
    beat of tense, silent communication. Then, Worf shoves<br>
    her away.</p>
  <p> Her eyes never leaving his, K'Ehleyr slowly removes<br>
    her glove, extends her naked hand to Worf.</p>
  <p>66A ON WORF</p>
  <p> Worf takes her wrist, raises her hand to his face,<br>
    sniffs at it.</p>

  <p>66F NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they move closer. Except for their hands on each<br>
    other's wrists, they have not touched, nor do they<br>
    now... instead, they sniff at each other's hair, their<br>
    ears, their necks. It's slow, ritualized -- and also<br>
    instinctive, primal, animal behavior.</p>
  <p> Their passion mounting, Worf and K'Ehleyr release their<br>
    grips, then extend their hands to one another.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>66G CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS</p>
  <p> as they touch their wrists, then the heels of their<br>
    hands together. Their fingers intertwine -- their<br>
    palms touch -- their grips tighten -- and they savagely<br>
    clasp hands... so tightly that their nails dig in and<br>
    draw blood.</p>
  <p>66H WIDER</p>
  <p> Worf and K'Ehleyr violently draw each other close.<br>
    With a low GROWL, Worf buries his face in K'Ehleyr's<br>
    neck -- and as they fall together into the mist, we:</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>67 INT. HOLODECK - BATTLEGROUND</p>
  <p> Stillness. The distant KEENING of some alien catcreature.</p>
  <p> PAN to reveal Worf and K'Ehleyr, spent. Worf, eyes<br>
    closed, is sitting cross-legged at the base of a low,<br>
    flat rock. K'Ehleyr, sitting atop the rock, smiles<br>
    contentedly.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Some calisthenics programs are<br>
    better than others.</p>
  <p> Worf, mildly surprised, opens one eye.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You can still make jokes?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Of course I can. I still have<br>
    enough energy for that...<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    You're not laughing.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are most observant.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    You don't like people with a sense<br>
    of humor?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I did not say that.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr waits, but nothing else is forthcoming.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Worf, you're the perfect Klingon<br>
    -- the ultimate minimalist. Talk<br>
    to me!</p>
  <p> After a beat, Worf grudgingly elaborates:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've noted that some people use<br>
    humor as a shield... they talk<br>
    much yet say little.</p>

    commendable... if belated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/17/89 - ACT FOUR 40A.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (ignoring the dig)<br>
    So far, I'm having no success.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I could use some help.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stiffly)<br>
    I am here to assist you.</p>
  <p> Worf steps in, revealing Data behind him. K'Ehleyr<br>
    smiles, almost sadly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/10/89 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Unwilling to be alone with me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I've asked Lieutenant Commander Data to <br>
    help us analyze the alternatives.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (&quot;oh, sure&quot;)<br>
    An android chaperone?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Android&quot; is, of course, correct,<br>
    but I fail to see how &quot;chaperone&quot;<br>
    is applicable in this situation...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Never mind. Come on in.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I guess I can't blame you.</p>
  <p> Worf says nothing. He and Data take seats on either<br>
    side of K'Ehleyr.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    (impulsively)<br>
    Tell me one thing.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her -- &quot;go ahead.&quot;</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    You would have gone through with<br>
    the oath, wouldn't you?<br>
    Regardless of the consequences<br>
    to our careers -- to our lives?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Honor demanded no less.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (sighs)<br>
    I'm sick to death of Klingon<br>
    &quot;honor.&quot; What do you want? Is<br>
    honor all you care about? Don't<br>
    you feel anything else?</p>
  <p>76 ON WORF</p>
  <p> Silent and stonefaced. Maybe he doesn't know the<br>
    answer; maybe he does and isn't telling. K'Ehleyr sees<br>
    she's going to get nothing out of him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>76 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    No comment, huh?</p>
  <p> She shrugs -- &quot;be that way.&quot; Data, mystified by all<br>
    this, looks from one to the other. K'Ehleyr picks up<br>
    on Data's confusion.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Poor android. Which behavior do<br>
    you find more perplexing -- human<br>
    or Klingon?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At the moment, I would be hard<br>
    pressed to choose.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (sardonic)<br>
    So would I.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr takes a breath, gets businesslike.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    Okay. When we locate the T'Ong,<br>
    there are two possibilities.<br>
    First --</p>
  <p> MATCH CUT TO:</p>
  <p>77 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Same ANGLE on K'Ehleyr, with Worf nearby -- but now<br>
    Picard, Riker, Troi, and Geordi are present, listening.<br>
    (Data is not present.)</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    -- we find the ship before it<br>
    reaches the &quot;awakening point.&quot;<br>
    In that case, we could simply keep<br>
    the crew asleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Is that feasible?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    We can beam an away team onto the<br>
    T'Ong and override the cryogenic<br>
    controls.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Then we await the arrival of the<br>
    Klingon ship P'rang...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... so that when the T'Ong's crew<br>
    awakens, they're surrounded by<br>
    their fellow Klingons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That would be ideal.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    But there's the second<br>
    possibility... that the crew of<br>
    the T'Ong has already revived.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They discover they're in<br>
    Federation territory -- and they<br>
    attack the nearest outpost.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are we sure they'll attack?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We don't even know what the<br>
    T'Ong's mission was.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It may have been a scientific<br>
    voyage.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    Klingons of that period -- doing<br>
    research for its own sake?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The point is, they may not be<br>
    warlike.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    The point is that this is beside<br>
    the point. These are Klingons...<br>
    at war with us. Whatever their<br>
    mission was -- once they see a<br>
    Federation target, they'll attack.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could the T'Ong be disabled rather<br>
    than destroyed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/12/89 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>77 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We could probably knock out their<br>
    warp engines without damaging the<br>
    rest of their ship...</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    That would gain you nothing.<br>
    Disable the ship, and K'Temoc will<br>
    destroy it himself.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Worf for confirmation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Klingons do not surrender.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Face it -- if we don't reach the<br>
    T'Ong before its crew wakes up,<br>
    you have no alternatives.</p>
  <p>78 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> getting to his feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not accept that. There<br>
    must be a way to make the Klingons<br>
    listen. If we can only convince<br>
    them --</p>
  <p> Picard is interrupted by a HALL from the bridge:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, we have detected a ship,<br>
    bearing three-one-six mark<br>
    forty-two, extreme sensor range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Plot an intercept course. And<br>
    go to Yellow Alert.</p>
  <p> Picard and the group EXIT the Observation Lounge.<br>
    Geordi EXITS out the far door.</p>
  <p>79 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Clancey's at Conn; N.D. CREW, including the tactical<br>
    crewman, at other stations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr, Riker, and Worf ENTER and take their<br>
    stations. Data yields the center chair to Picard,<br>
    sits down at Ops.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields are up.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Better lock on phasers. This may<br>
    be the only chance you get.</p>
  <p> Picard ignores her.</p>
  <p> CLANCEY<br>
    Intercept course laid in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hold this position. Let's see<br>
    if they've spotted us.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Magnification one hundred.</p>
  <p>80 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> upon which is a vision from the past -- the eighty-year-old<br>
    KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER T'ONG.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors show lifeforms aboard,<br>
    sir, but I am unable to ascertain<br>
    if they are awake or dormant.<br>
    (checks a reading)<br>
    However, the vessel's propulsion<br>
    systems are inactive, so I would<br>
    hypothesize that the crew is<br>
    asleep --</p>
  <p> And without warning, the T'Ong FIRES upon us --</p>
  <p>81 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the bridge is SHAKEN by the attack. RED ALERT comes<br>
    on automatically.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, I could be in error.</p>

  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Shields holding.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    They've cloaked themselves.</p>
  <p>83 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as K'Ehleyr matter-of-factly turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Well, Captain -- you had your<br>
    chance.</p>
  <p> PUSH IN on Picard's grave expression as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>84 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Worf, Data, Clancey as before. RED<br>

    his bridge Engineering Station.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Transfer Engineering to bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you find them?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (working at the station)<br>
    I think so. Those old shields<br>
    weren't a hundred percent<br>
    efficient at blocking gamma-ray<br>
    output. If I can tune the sensors<br>
    to a particular band of...<br>

    There! Got 'em! Transferring<br>

    Intercept. Warp two.</p>
  <p> CLANCEY<br>
    Warp two, sir.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Captain -- let them die like<br>
    Klingons... in battle. They<br>
    deserve that much.</p>
  <p> Worf steps forward.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... I have another option.</p>
  <p> Picard and the others react to Worf's calm assertion.</p>
  <p>85 OMITTED</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>87 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before, except that Worf and K'Ehleyr are no longer<br>
    present. The tactical crewman is at Worf's station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The T'Ong has changed course to<br>

    They're making a break for it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Overtake. Warp eight.</p>

    Aye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put us right in their path and<br>

  <p>87B INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've thrown down the gauntlet...<br>
    let's see if they pick it up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They are slowing to impulse --</p>
  <p>88 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> On the screen, the star field SHIMMERS -- and the T'Ong<br>
    APPEARS as it drops its cloaking. It FIRES phasers at<br>
    us --</p>
  <p>89 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the bridge is SHAKEN slightly by the attack.</p>
  <p> TACTICAL CREWMAN<br>
    Phaser hit on forward shields.<br>
    No damage.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The T'Ong is attempting to flank<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Compensate.</p>
  <p>90 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the T'Ong FIRES a photon torpedo --</p>
  <p>91 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the torpedo hits, SHAKING the ship a bit more.</p>
  <p> TACTICAL CREWMAN<br>
    Photon torpedo hit. Shield number<br>
    two weakened... firming up now...<br>
    No damage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think we've piqued their<br>
    curiosity by now...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>91 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. Let's give them the<br>
    chance to look their enemy in the<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to look offscreen. We don't see who he's<br>
    addressing:</p>
  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Ready, Lieutenant?<br>

    Open a hailing frequency.</p>
  <p> TACTICAL CREWMAN<br>
    Hailing frequency open, sir.</p>
  <p>92 OMITTED</p>
  <p>93 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> motionless, facing the T'Ong.</p>
  <p>94 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the image of the T'Ong is replaced by a view of the<br>
    T'ONG BRIDGE. K'TEMOC, the captain, is a formidable<br>
    warrior who commands his ship with a typical Klingon<br>
    iron first. A FIRST OFFICER and another KLINGON CREWMAN<br>
    are in the b.g.</p>
  <p> The Klingons all react with surprise. K'Temoc leaps<br>
    to his feet --</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    What --</p>
  <p>95 ANGLE ON THE ENTERPRISE COMMAND CHAIR</p>
  <p> The captain of the Enterprise is a Klingon! Worf, in<br>
    full Klingon captain regalia, sits in the command chair<br>
    glaring at K'Temoc.</p>
  <p> Next to Worf is K'Ehleyr, similarly in full Klingon<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are not visible, but Data, Clancey,<br>
    Geordi, and the tactical crewman are at their stations.</p>

  <p>95 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (imperious)<br>
    Captain K'Temoc -- have you lost<br>
    your mind? Halt your ship and<br>
    drop your shields.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>96 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Klingon crewmen are stunned. So is K'Temoc, but<br>
    he keeps a lid on it and blusters back to Worf:</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    What treachery is this? By whose<br>
    authority?</p>
  <p>97 ANGLE ON WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf gives K'Temoc a look as if K'Temoc were a two-year-old<br>
    challenging a parent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Worf, commanding the<br>
    Enterprise. It is you who have<br>
    committed an act of treason --<br>
    by firing upon this ship.</p>
  <p>98 INTERCUTS -- WORF AND VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    I have standing orders to fire<br>
    on all Federation ships. We are<br>
    at war.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You fool. Did it not occur to<br>
    you that the war would be over<br>
    by now?</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    I have no proof of that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Trust your eyes! Or is your brain<br>
    still stuck in its long slumber?</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    How can I be sure this is not a<br>
    Federation trick?</p>
  <p> Worf SIGHS. Why must underlings make life difficult?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, as you are new to this<br>
    century, I have tried to be<br>
    patient. But I will tolerate no<br>
    further insubordination. Drop<br>
    your shields immediately.</p>

  <p>98 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>

    You dare not destroy us. We have<br>

    of the Klingon High Command...</p>
  <p> Worf, the Iceman, impassively raises his hand as a<br>
    signal to fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?</p>
  <p> TACTICAL CREWMAN<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with a shrug)<br>
    Very well. Fire all phasers --</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    Wait!</p>
  <p> K'Temoc crosses his arms and gently bows his head.</p>
  <p> K'TEMOC (cont'd)<br>
    (to first officer)<br>
    Lower the shields.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I yield command of the T'Ong to<br>
    you, Captain Worf. Long live the<br>
    Klingon Empire.</p>
  <p> Worf is deadpan, indifferent.</p>

  <p>99 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A wise decision, Captain.<br>
    Commander K'Ehleyr will board your<br>

  <p> K'TEMOC<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.</p>

  <p>100 ANGLE ON WORF (OPTICAL)</p>

    you, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you and congratulations,<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    All set.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I relieve you.</p>
  <p> O'Brien opens his mouth to say something, changes his<br>

    alone.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>

  <p>102 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Worf turns to face K'Ehleyr. They treat each other in<br>
    the most formal manner -- perhaps as a way of easing<br>
    the separation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Klingon vessel P'rang will<br>
    rendezvous with you in three days.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    In the meantime, I'll begin the<br>
    assimilation of these Klingons<br>
    to our era.</p>
  <p> A silent look. Is that all?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is there anything else you<br>
    require?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    No. Nothing else.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr takes a step towards the transporter, stops<br>
    and turns back to face Worf.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go<br>
    without saying another word,<br>
    wouldn't you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What needs to be said?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Nothing. Everything. We're about<br>
    to go our separate ways again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And that disturbs you?</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    (takes a breath)<br>
    Yes, it does.</p>
  <p> She moves closer to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - REV. 4/12/89 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>102 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    I hid the truth from you. Last<br>
    night did have meaning.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I was tempted to take the oath<br>
    with you. That scared me. I've<br>
    never had such strong feelings<br>
    toward anyone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (after a beat)<br>
    Nor have I.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr's stunned. From Worf, that's quite an<br>
    admission.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR<br>
    Then it was more than just a point<br>
    of honor.</p>
  <p> Worf's silence is eloquent.</p>
  <p> K'EHLEYR (cont'd)<br>
    Maybe someday, when our paths<br>
    cross again, I won't be as easy<br>
    to get rid of.</p>
  <p> K'Ehleyr and Worf extend their hands, touch palms, and<br>
    clasp -- a gentle version of the passionate handclasp<br>
    they shared in the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    K'Ehleyr... I will not be complete<br>
    without you.</p>
  <p> A long beat. Then, K'Ehleyr steps onto the transporter<br>
    pad.</p>
  <p>103 ON WORF</p>
  <p> Perhaps to cover his sorrow, his face bears something<br>
    with a close resemblance to a smile...</p>
  <p>104 ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as K'Ehleyr DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Emissary&quot; - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>105 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> as his face returns to the more familiar unemotional<br>
    expression of -- the Iceman.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE <br>
    THE END </p>
