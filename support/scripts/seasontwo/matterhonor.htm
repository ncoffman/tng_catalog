    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels through space at warp speed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> WESLEY is at the Conn. WORF is at Tactical. DATA is<br>
    at Ops, RIKER has the Command Chair. All other<br>
    stations are staffed by n.d. crewmembers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are approaching Starbase<br>
    one-seven-nine.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Half impulse, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Going to half impulse.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise comes out of warp, slows to the<br>
    proper impulse speed.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, this is the bridge. We<br>
    have arrived at Starbase<br>
    one-seven-nine.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    Establish position -- zero-nine-zero mark<br>
    three-seven-five -- at<br>
    twenty-seven thousand<br>
    kilometers.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Open hailing frequencies,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Starbase one-seven-nine, this is<br>
    the USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STARBASE COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise, this is Starbase<br>
    one-seven-nine. We are ready for<br>
    transfer on your mark.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Riker gets to his feet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Commander Data, you have the<br>
    bridge. Ensign Crusher, you will<br>
    accompany me.</p>
  <p> As Riker and Wesley exit, Data takes the Command<br>
    position.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise establishes its position near the<br>
    starbase. The starbase is located on a misty, shrouded<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p>6 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data has the Command Chair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Starbase one-seven-nine. We are<br>
    ready to commence transfer.</p>
  <p> STARBASE COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledge Enterprise. Begin<br>
    transfer.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> FIVE MEMBERS of the Enterprise crew (three men, two<br>
    women) stand on the transporter pads. Riker and the<br>
    TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN at the control panel.<br>
    Wesley is off to one side. Riker eyes them with a<br>
    warmth and with a sense of humor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is my last chance to say that<br>
    it has been a pleasure to serve<br>
    with you and to wish you luck on<br>
    your new assignment. You have<br>
    served the Enterprise well.<br>
    (slight smile)<br>
    No tears, please.</p>
  <p> Before the members on the pad can cover their smiles to<br>
    answer:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The five crewmembers DEMATERIALIZE. Wesley and Riker<br>
    laugh.</p>
  <p> Transporter Chief O'Brien responds to a signal on the<br>
    panel, announces in response.</p>
  <p> CHIEF O'BRIEN<br>
    Enterprise ready. Beam aboard.</p>
  <p>8 ON PADS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> FOUR REPLACEMENTS MATERIALIZE on the pads, among them<br>
    is ENSIGN MENDON, a large, blue-skinned officer from<br>
    the planet Benzar. He breathes through a special<br>
    device at his chest which converts the oxygen level to<br>
    his use. He is young, alert, quick moving and as the<br>
    nature of Benzites, he is always ready to please and<br>
    demonstrate his abilities.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>9 SCENE</p>
  <p> The new members step off the pad and file through the<br>
    doorway with nods and smiles. Wesley spots Mendon and<br>
    reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    I'm Commander William Riker, your<br>
    first officer. Those of you who<br>
    are here as replacements will step<br>
    outside and Lieutenant Lewis will<br>
    assign you to crew quarters.<br>
    (to Mendon)<br>
    Ensign, you are here on the<br>
    exchange program, you'll follow<br>
    Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley steps forward anxiously. He addresses Mendon in<br>
    a friendly manner.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Mordoc, what are you doing here?<br>
    You couldn't have graduated from<br>
    the Academy already.</p>
  <p> Mendon eyes Wesley oddly.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I am not Mordoc. I am Mendon.<br>
    Ensign Mendon of the planet<br>
    Benzar.</p>
  <p>10 ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> He is slightly flustered, embarrassed. He explains:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm sorry sir. I thought you were<br>
    a friend... Mordoc...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... You look just like him.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    We are from the same<br>
    geostructure. Naturally we look<br>
    alike.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How do you tell each other apart?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    We just do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>11 SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker steps in to save Wesley any further<br>
    embarrassment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, nice to have you here<br>
    Ensign. There will be a<br>
    briefing and indoctrination<br>
    session as soon as you settle in.</p>
  <p>12 SCENE</p>
  <p> Mendon stops next to Riker to announce.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I want to tell you how happy I<br>
    am to be assigned to the<br>
    Enterprise. It wasn't just luck.<br>
    I requested it. I know I can<br>
    be of great help to the ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Yes, of course. Now if you'll<br>
    just follow Ensign Crusher.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> As Mendon exits the room Riker gives a quick &quot;God save<br>
    us&quot; glance to Transporter Chief O'Brien. Picard's<br>
    com voice is heard.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker, report to the<br>
    Phaser Range, please...</p>
  <p> Riker touches his communicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On the way.</p>
  <p> Riker exits the room.</p>
  <p>12A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in position near the starbase.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>13 INT. PHASER RANGE - CLOSE ON TARGET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it is zapped by a phaser beam and flashes a burst of<br>
    light and a change of color. Then another one next to<br>
    it. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Riker and Picard at<br>
    the firing station, almost back to back and firing at<br>
    light targets that appear in an arc around them.<br>
    Picard fires off two blasts of his own phaser. The<br>
    targets are HIT.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was wondering if you had any<br>
    feelings about the Officer<br>
    Exchange Program that has been<br>
    initiated by Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just positive ones sir. I've<br>
    already welcomed Ensign Mendon<br>
    on board and he certainly seems<br>
    eager to please.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's a Benzite trait.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's been suggested that one of<br>
    the officers on the Enterprise<br>
    might like to participate in this<br>
    exchange program.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Probably a good idea.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a moment to fire off three quick blasts<br>
    and then to remark offhandedly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's a Klingon vessel in the<br>
    vicinity.</p>
  <p> Riker covers any reaction by firing his own phaser at<br>
    the target. Both men continue to fire in order, both<br>
    of them covering any reaction and attempting to act<br>
    nonchalant about this assignment</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't recall ever hearing of<br>
    a Federation officer serving on<br>
    a Klingon vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Neither have I.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It could be beneficial.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Having Worf on board certainly<br>
    has been.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes sir, that's true.<br>
    (a shot)<br>
    Who did you intend to send?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was going to ask for a<br>
    volunteer.</p>
  <p> As Picard fires his phaser:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wouldn't mind, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What was that, Number One?</p>
  <p> Picard covers his smile. Riker spots it, knows he's<br>
    been played with.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I said I wouldn't mind the<br>
    assignment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any particular reason?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (broad grin)<br>
    Because nobody has ever done it<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> Riker opens up with a series of three blasts at the<br>
    target which light it up like a Christmas tree.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll notify starbase of your<br>
    acceptance... They'll contact the<br>
    Klingon vessel and make the<br>
    arrangements.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard fires at his target, hits it, turns to Riker to<br>
    smile, then walks away.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it continues its solo, steady and effortless<br>
    impulse flight.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 42606.5.<br>
    I have informed the staff of<br>
    Commander Riker's temporary duty<br>
    assignment and we have departed<br>
    from Starbase one-seven-nine and<br>
    are headed for a rendezvous with<br>
    the Klingon vessel, the Pagh.</p>
  <p>15 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker walk and talk. Worf is more animated<br>
    than usual as he speaks of the Klingon ship and his<br>
    heritage with a certain pride.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have studied and know everything<br>
    about my heritage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you are the one to fill me<br>
    in on something that I'm not<br>
    clear about.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's my understanding that one<br>
    of the duties of the first officer<br>
    on a Klingon ship is to<br>
    assassinate the captain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Wouldn't that bring about chaos?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course not. When and if the<br>
    captain becomes weak and unable<br>
    to perform, it is expected that<br>
    his honorable retirement should<br>
    be assisted by his &quot;first.&quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The second officer would<br>
    assassinate you for the same<br>
    reasons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This method of attrition could<br>
    take a little getting used to.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Klingon system has operated<br>
    successfully for centuries.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is different.</p>
  <p>16 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> He looks at Riker, nods solemnly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Many things will be different.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley at his Forward Station of Conn. Data is in<br>
    Command. All other stations are covered by n.d.<br>
    crewmembers except for Science One, which is manned<br>
    by Ensign Mendon.</p>
  <p> Ensign Mendon steps from his station to look over the<br>
    shoulder of the crewmember at the Tactical Station. He<br>
    watches for a beat, then comments:</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    That's a wonderful method of<br>
    maintaining a constant control<br>
    factor over defensive shields,<br>
    but I'm sure there's a way to<br>
    improve response time.</p>
  <p> The crewmember turns to give Mendon a look. Mendon<br>
    reads it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Oh, sorry, didn't mean to<br>
    interrupt you... Just thought I<br>
    could be of some help, however<br>
    I am correct in what I said.</p>
  <p> Mendon continues his studying walk and ends up next<br>
    to Wesley at Conn. He peers over Wesley's shoulder<br>
    in the same overseeing manner.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    That is superb designing,<br>
    absolutely first rate.</p>
  <p> Wesley remains courteous to a ranking officer even if<br>
    he has the annoying Benzite trait of aggressiveness<br>
    of an over-achiever.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes it is. Would you care to<br>
    be more specific?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    The input sampling. It's simple<br>
    yet efficient enough. Of course<br>
    a minor change of the helm<br>
    readout would be much more<br>
    helpful in emergency situations.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We've never had any trouble with<br>
    it. Have you seen it work?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Not in a practical exercise, but<br>
    in theory... my theory... it would<br>
    be more than a marginal<br>
    improvement. I'll have to mention<br>
    this to the captain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You're going to advise Captain<br>
    Picard?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Captain Picard... I'll have to<br>
    discuss these improvements with<br>
    him.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He is open to some astute<br>
    observations, isn't he?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, I've never heard Captain<br>
    Picard refuse to listen to his<br>
    officers.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Outstanding! Pretty soon we'll<br>
    get things running perfectly.</p>
  <p> Mendon walks away. Wesley's look follows him.</p>
  <p>18 INT. TEN-FORWARD LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker sits at a table surrounded by an assortment of<br>
    dishes. Each one is a little more disgusting than the<br>
    other. If they are edible it is the surprise of the<br>
    space age. Riker grimaces as he tests each one in<br>
    order. Pulaski steps over to look down on his feast.<br>
    She reaches over to lift something ugly.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A Klingon delicacy. That's heart<br>
    of targ -- this is pipius claw.<br>
    And this is stewed &quot;gagh.&quot;</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    &quot;Gagh&quot;?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Serpent worms... would you like<br>
    to know how they're prepared?</p>
  <p> Pulaski sits down at the table. A waiter arrives with<br>
    about six different drinks. Riker moves some plates<br>
    around to make room.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No thanks. I've never heard of<br>
    a Klingon starving to death on<br>
    one of their own vessels, but you<br>
    might.</p>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I know all about that. Their<br>
    beliefs may be somewhat brutal<br>
    but usually what kills us, kills<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sniffing an awful<br>
    drink)<br>
    That's something to look forward<br>
    to. Would you like a drink,<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm abstaining in honor of your<br>
    last hour on board.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (mock serious)<br>
    Your sacrifice will not go<br>
    unnoticed.</p>
  <p> Picard approaches the table from the turbolift.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard looks down at the table full of food and<br>
    covers his reaction. Riker is about to get to his<br>
    feet. Picard puts a restraining hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand the theory of the<br>
    feast before the transfer. I've<br>
    done the same thing dozens of<br>
    times. However, I usually made<br>
    more civil choices.</p>
  <p> Pulaski covers her grin. A tray of desserts arrives<br>
    and Pulaski starts to arrange them in whatever space is<br>
    left.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    These are the most civil choices.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see... Well, their food may be<br>
    somewhat backward but the Klingons<br>
    are efficient, loyal to their<br>
    beliefs, and are regulated by a<br>
    strict code of ethics.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    True enough. They tend to lean<br>
    towards a Samurai civilization<br>
    that is thousands of years old.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But they are pure in that<br>
    tradition.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is a great opportunity,<br>
    Number One. We really know so<br>
    little about them. We have so<br>
    much to learn.<br>
    (beat, smile)<br>
    I think I envy you, Will Riker.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes him, nods, almost takes another bite of<br>
    food accidentally, then drops it as he becomes<br>
    aware...</p>
  <p>20 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker moves down the corridor towards the Transporter<br>
    Room. Worf approaches him. He carefully hands Riker a<br>
    small electronic device about the size of a Bic<br>
    lighter. Riker studies it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    An emergency transponder?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Slightly altered to transmit an<br>
    omnidirectional signal and an<br>
    emergency call.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (examining)<br>
    Are you sensing some trouble<br>
    that I don't?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (embarrassed)<br>
    Simply a security precaution.<br>
    I want to insure your return to<br>
    this ship.</p>

  <p>22 MAIN VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We see the Klingon vessel on viewscreen. Then the<br>
    fierce and unmerciful face of CAPTAIN KARGAN fills the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Jean-Luc Picard, captain of<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    And I am Captain Kargan of the<br>
    Pagh. Beam your first officer<br>
    on board immediately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are preparing to do so.<br>
    You're getting a good man,<br>
    Captain Kargan.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Thank you for your opinion but<br>
    I will judge that for myself.<br>
    Screen off.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen goes blank. Mendon comments to Worf.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Not very hospitable are they?</p>
  <p> Worf responds to him immediately.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is not your concern. Observe<br>
    your station, Ensign Mendon.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    (realizing)<br>
    Didn't mean to offend you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You didn't...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... Yet.</p>
  <p>22A ANGLE ON SCIENCE SCREEN</p>
  <p> Mendon turns back to his screen, adjusts a knob so that<br>
    the schematic on screen starts to turn. It is a<br>
    skeleton version of the Klingon vessel. Various<br>
    technical information scrolls across the screen below<br>
    the blueprint.</p>
  <p> Then the faint glimmer of a red smear appears on the<br>
    hull of the ship.</p>
  <p>23 CLOSER ON SCREEN</p>
  <p> Mendon magnifies the screen and brings the red smear<br>
    to the forefront. Then he punches in an informational<br>
    request DIRECT SENSOR BEAM. The screen blinks with<br>
    SUBSTANCE REQUEST then after a beat answers NOT<br>
    DETERMINED. Mendon types in an additional request,<br>
    CATEGORY. The scrolled response appears MICROBIOTIC<br>
    COLONY... BACTERIAL ANALOG... SUBATOMIC...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Then DIAGNOSIS, the answer TO BE DETERMINED. Mendon's<br>
    concentration is interrupted by Captain Picard's<br>
    orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good Luck, Commander.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>27 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Klingon vessel Pagh slowly moving away from the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>28 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard eyes the main viewscreen. We see the Pagh<br>
    diminishing in size as it puts more distance between<br>
    itself and the Enterprise. Data acting as first<br>
    officer issues the orders.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Viewscreen off. Resume course.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen returns to its original pattern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take over Commander Data, I'll<br>
    be in my quarters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> Picard moves away from his Command position. He passes<br>
    the Science One station, nods to Mendon who seizes this<br>
    opportunity to attempt to ingratiate himself to his<br>
    new commander, much to the annoyance of Worf.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Sir, I'm Ensign Mendon. I just<br>
    wanted to tell you how pleased<br>
    I am to be aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (distracted)<br>
    Yes, of course. Nice to have you<br>
    on board.</p>
  <p> Picard continues on the move. Mendon takes a few steps<br>
    with him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    If you have a few minutes I've<br>
    noted a few procedural items that<br>
    could speed up operations on the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> Picard understanding his Benzite traits, is patient<br>
    with him.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I pick things up very quickly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you do Ensign, you<br>
    have an excellent record.<br>
    However, on the Enterprise we use<br>
    the chain of command. You may<br>
    report your observations to<br>
    Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I didn't mean to challenge your<br>
    authority...<br>
    (trailing off)<br>
    ... I just wanted to impress upon<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No need to apologize Ensign...<br>
    we should have explained it better<br>
    during indoctrination.</p>
  <p> Picard continues on to the turbolift.</p>
  <p>28A ANGLE ON WORF</p>
  <p> He turns to Mendon with a look that could burn holes<br>
    in your chest.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ensign Mendon... You may impress<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> On Mendon's look.</p>
  <p>29 EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON VESSEL &quot;PAGH&quot; (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> alone in space. Its harsher angles and look almost<br>
    scary against the stillness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 INT. PAGH - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Everything about this ship is utilitarian and lacks<br>
    the smooth free-flowing lines and coloring of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Riker and a KLINGON OFFICER, who is the TACTICS<br>
    OFFICER, turn a corner and walk down the corridor.<br>
    They are both wary but open. The Klingon studies Riker<br>
    in a speculating manner.</p>
  <p> Crewmembers also eye Riker in passing. Some with the<br>
    same reaction as the tactics officer, others simply<br>
    interested... They all acknowledge Riker with a<br>
    courteous nod.</p>
  <p> Riker returns the look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something wrong?</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    No, Commander.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's just I have never seen anyone<br>
    of your species before...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smile)<br>
    I'm just your average everyday<br>
    human who happens to be a<br>
    commander. Now what are your<br>
    orders?</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    I am to escort you to the captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Riker falls in behind the Klingon.</p>

  <p>33 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker and his escort enter onto the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The same sparse but functional look. The bridge is<br>
    manned by FIVE CREWMEMBERS at varying stations.<br>
    Captain Kargan is seated in the Command Chair. SECOND<br>
    OFFICER KLAG stands next to him. They are businesslike<br>
    in their appraisal of Riker. Firm but not harsh.<br>
    Riker steps forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander William Riker of<br>
    the Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    That is incorrect.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You are Commander Riker, first<br>
    officer of the Klingon Cruiser<br>
    Pagh, or do you intend to<br>
    disobey Federation orders?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have no such intentions,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Exactly where are your loyalties,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm afraid I still don't<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> Kargan explains carefully in a low, calm voice.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    This ship is equipped with our<br>
    best weapons and our finest<br>
    warriors. Although we are on a<br>
    peaceful mission we are prepared<br>
    to go into battle instantly. I<br>
    know I can count on every Klingon<br>
    warrior in this crew to serve and<br>
    die in that battle. So I ask<br>
    again Commander Riker,<br>
    (beat)<br>
    where are your loyalties?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have been assigned here to serve<br>
    this ship and to obey your orders.<br>
    I will do exactly that.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Will you take an oath to that<br>
    effect?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (meets his gaze)<br>
    I just did.</p>
  <p> Klag interjects firmly to Captain Kargan.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do<br>
    not believe him! He lies!)</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    (to Klag)<br>
    Hol-chaj yI-jatlh. (Speak in<br>
    their language.)<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    This is your second officer,<br>
    Lieutenant Klag.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Was there something you wanted<br>
    to say to me, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Yes sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't believe you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I take it you challenge my<br>
    authority over you.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Kargan)<br>
    And your position in this,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    (with disdain)<br>
    I would call it your first command<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Riker looks around the Main Bridge at the other<br>
    crewmembers.</p>
  <p>33A RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> The Klingon crewmembers watch him, waiting to see his<br>
    reaction to this challenge.</p>
  <p>33B SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the arrogant stance and size of Klag who<br>
    gives him an insubordinate snort. Riker realizes he<br>
    has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or<br>
    aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his<br>
    full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the<br>
    chest of Klag.</p>
  <p>33C SERIES OF CUTS</p>
  <p> The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes<br>
    through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his<br>
    breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing<br>
    against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.</p>
  <p> Riker calmly steps around the still-seated captain and<br>
    steps in front of Klag who is struggling to his feet.</p>
  <p> Klag is almost to his feet when Riker swings again,<br>
    this time taking the legs out from under Klag who drops<br>
    to the ground again.</p>
  <p> The crewmembers are animated and watch the fight with<br>
    relish, not caring who wins or loses but that there is<br>
    combat.</p>
  <p> Riker looks over to the captain.</p>
  <p> Captain Kargan simply sits back and allows it to<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> Riker turns back to the dazed but still active Klag who<br>
    is once more attempting to get to his feet.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the combatant with a calculated but<br>
    astonished eye. Klag can barely stand but bravely<br>
    fights for balance. Riker shrugs, and rams his fist<br>
    into Klag's stomach, then drops him with another<br>
    double-handed blow over the head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>33D SCENE</p>
  <p> Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.</p>
  <p> Klag is awake but prone. He struggles to his feet,<br>
    manages to prop himself against the wall. Klag gives<br>
    Riker as much a look of respect as he is able...</p>
  <p>33E ON RIKER</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My oath is between Captain Kargan<br>
    and myself. Your only concern<br>
    is how to obey my orders.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Or do you prefer the rank of<br>
    prisoner over that of lieutenant?</p>
  <p> Klag calculates Riker carefully, then:</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    I will take your orders.</p>
  <p> Riker nods his acceptance. Klag returns it. Kargan<br>
    interjects:</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    And you, Commander Riker, will<br>
    obey my orders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed, Captain Kargan.</p>
  <p> Riker turns away from the captain, and when no one can<br>
    see him he lets his breath out.</p>
  <p>34 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continuing on its solo run at impulse.</p>
  <p>35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Data at Command. Worf at Tactical and<br>
    Mendon at Science One. All other crew personnel are<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, the automatic scan has<br>
    registered some unknown substance<br>
    on the aft quarter of the exterior<br>

    Zero in on that location and<br>
    define.</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE ON SCIENCE STATION SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Mendon punches in the various components needed. His<br>
    screen picks up the schematic of the Enterprise and the<br>
    designated location of the &quot;unknown substance.&quot;</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I've located it sir. The dorsal<br>
    of the Engineering Section.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    On viewscreen. Focus on area.<br>
    Magnification factor ten.</p>
  <p> The matter appears as a sort of haze on the viewscreen.<br>
    Data walks over to the Science Station.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Increase magnification to<br>
    twenty.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen now shows a more detailed picture of<br>
    the mass.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Analyze.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The substance appears to be a rare<br>
    form of subatomic &quot;bacteria,&quot;<br>
    capable of doubling every fifteen<br>
    minutes. It seems to be reacting<br>
    with two of the compounds present<br>
    in the Enterprise structure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Determine origin.</p>
  <p> Mendon feels that he has his opportunity now.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I noticed it when I did an<br>
    intensive scan of the Pagh,<br>
    the Klingon ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    And you informed no one?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I have not yet completed my full<br>
    analysis.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are supposed to report<br>
    whatever is out of the ordinary.<br>
    This falls into that category.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    But sir, as I said I have not yet<br>
    completed my analysis. It would<br>
    be improper to report it until<br>
    then.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How did you come by that<br>
    decision?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    It is a Benzite regulation. No<br>
    officer on the deck of one of our<br>
    ships would report an occurrence<br>
    like this until he had a full<br>
    analysis and a resolution.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have simply followed proper<br>
    procedures.</p>
  <p> On Picard -- he holds for a beat then instructs Mendon<br>
    calmly but firmly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is our procedure for you to<br>
    bring to the attention of command<br>
    any possibility of danger. You<br>
    will not make those decisions.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is that clear, Ensign Mendon?</p>
  <p> Mendon is somewhat deflated.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fine. Now I want you to complete<br>
    the analysis and determine the<br>
    danger not only to this ship but<br>
    the Klingon vessel as well.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Yes Captain... That will take a<br>
    couple of hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll remain at your station<br>
    until it is complete, then report<br>

    supervise you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns and walks to the turbolift. Worf eyes<br>
    Mendon, whispers to him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Commander's log, supplemental,<br>
    Stardate 42607.8. I have been<br>
    on the Pagh a short time but long<br>
    enough to be impressed with the<br>
    abilities and singlemindedness<br>
    of the Klingons. I can now see<br>
    why they have gained the respect<br>
    of Captain Picard.</p>
  <p>39 INT. PAGH - MESS HALL</p>
  <p> Klingons line the long bench-like table, Riker among<br>
    them. They are not unfriendly to Riker but they watch<br>
    him eat like he were on display. A COUPLE OF THE<br>
    FEMALES, VEKMA one of them, are a little more outgoing<br>
    and interested. They mumble to each other as they eye<br>
    Riker. They match Riker in size, maybe even a little<br>
    bigger.</p>
  <p>40 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He is aware of the attention he is getting and tries<br>
    to ignore it and simply fall in unnoticed with the rest<br>
    of the Klingon personnel. His look alone makes that<br>
    impossible.</p>
  <p> The Klingons keep pushing plates in front of him and he<br>
    takes each one in turn and tries to eat as little as<br>
    possible while not showing any reaction.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    You're not eating very much.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I'm not that hungry.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Is the food all right, Commander?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fine. The &quot;pipius&quot; was excellent,<br>
    and I also liked the &quot;Bregit<br>
    lungs.&quot;</p>
  <p> VEKMA<br>
    And the Rokeg blood pie?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Then you'll also like this.</p>
  <p> Klag pushes another bowl in front of him.</p>
  <p>40A ON RIKER</p>
  <p> His face as he examines it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is &quot;gagh,&quot; isn't it?</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Very good. You did some research<br>
    on our nutritional choices.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... but this is still moving.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    &quot;Gagh&quot; is always best when served<br>
    live.<br>
    (covering smile)<br>
    Would you like something &quot;easier&quot;?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Easier?</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    If Klingon food is too strong for<br>
    you, perhaps I could get one of<br>
    the females to breast feed you.</p>
  <p> Vekma and the other female laugh. The men at the table<br>
    eye Riker with careful but joking looks. Riker goes<br>
    along with the mood.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>40A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't tell me you're still<br>
    concerned about my not<br>
    weakening?</p>
  <p> Klag bellows out in laughter.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Look around. You'll see that<br>
    there are no old warriors.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course, I'm sure they all died<br>
    with honor.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    (slaps him on the back)<br>
    Exactly. You may live long enough<br>
    to learn about us.</p>
  <p> Vekma reaches over to poke Riker in the arm and then<br>
    the ribs, then comments to ZEGOV and they both break<br>
    up with laughter.</p>
  <p> VEKMA<br>
    He's not very attractive, but<br>
    I will have him.</p>
  <p> Riker gives Klag a pleading look.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    They are inquisitive. They would<br>
    like to know how you would endure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Endure what?</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Them.</p>
  <p>40B RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> The two enormous and violent Klingon women as they<br>
    stare at him and dwarf him with their size and<br>
    strength. Riker looks at them innocently.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    One or both?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>40B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Klag holds for a beat then breaks out laughing. The<br>
    women join in, Vekma smacking Riker across the back in<br>
    good will and almost dislodging a rib. She moves<br>
    closer to Riker.</p>

  <p> At impulse. To establish.</p>
  <p>49 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - SCIENCE ONE</p>
  <p> A worried looking Ensign Mendon is explaining to<br>
    Captain Picard and Data as he points to the science<br>
    screen in front of him which shows the molecular<br>
    spectroscopic breakdown of the bacteria.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    It is confirmed that the organisms<br>
    feed on some of the compounds that<br>
    make up the Enterprise hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the Klingon ship, the Pagh?</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    They are much more susceptible.<br>
    Their hull contains all of the<br>
    compounds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Project your calculations.</p>
  <p> Mendon depresses a couple of keys and his work screen<br>
    is filled with a scrolling set of mathematical<br>
    computations. Data stares at the screen, then hits<br>
    another button so they project faster. They reach an<br>
    end. Data looks up.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to the rate of<br>
    reproduction there should be a<br>
    twelve centimeter hole in the<br>
    Klingon hull at this time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>50 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard issues orders as he moves to his Command Chair.<br>
    Data is right behind him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Signal them at once and advise<br>
    them. Change our course to<br>
    attempt an intercept. We will<br>
    make every attempt to cleanse the<br>
    vessel and assist with repairs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It will take some time to locate<br>
    them. They are on undesignated<br>
    maneuvers in the Pheben solar<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then start immediately. Alert<br>
    Engineering of this situation.<br>
    Ensign Crusher, adjust course<br>
    toward the proper sector.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Aye sir. Shall we prepare for<br>
    warp speed?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes...<br>

  <p> Riker and the crewmember stop. Riker changes direction<br>

  <p> Captain Kargan waits with Klag and the rest of the<br>

    Riker steps onto the bridge. Captain Kargan motions<br>
    him over.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    On monitor. Tell me Commander<br>
    Riker, what do you make of this?</p>
  <p>54 ANGLE MONITOR (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> Captain Kargan calls out his orders to the crewmembers<br>
    present.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I felt no collision. Were we hit<br>
    by a small meteor?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    There was no collision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Corrosion then.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    No, not corrosion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> KARGAN<br>
    We already have and fortunately<br>

    that could withstand the change<br>
    in pressure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what is it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    A space organism eating away at<br>
    our hull. Our estimate is that<br>
    in less than eight hours we will<br>
    have lost too much of our shell<br>
    to remain intact.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You must have a way to repair<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    I'm afraid not.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There has to be. Where did this<br>
    come from?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    &quot;Where&quot; might be the answer.<br>
    (harsher beat)<br>
    The only contact we had was with<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There was no direct contact with<br>

    Various information pops up on the screen.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    The Enterprise did conduct an<br>
    intensive scan of this vessel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's normal procedure.</p>
  <p> The other bridge members turn angry looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    What type of beam did the<br>
    Enterprise use to create this<br>
    damage in our hull?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None! Why would they do that?<br>
    We are allies.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    My logs indicate that the<br>
    Enterprise directed an intense<br>
    scanning beam at this specific<br>
    area for a duration of two<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Explain that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    It could be a weapon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait a minute. Why? There's<br>
    no new weapon. The Enterprise<br>
    has no reason to do this,<br>
    especially not with me on board.<br>
    It makes no sense.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    &quot;Why&quot; is no longer important.<br>
    What is important is our response<br>
    to this attack.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Engage cloaking device. Change<br>

    Intend? There is only one<br>

  <p>59 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Ensign Mendon works at the Science Station along with<br>
    another n.d. officer. Mendon is efficient and intent<br>
    on his assignment. It is obvious that he knows what<br>
    he's doing. Wesley is relieved from his station and<br>
    before he leaves he steps over to stand next to Mendon.</p>
  <p>60 CLOSER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Wesley watches for a beat, then seeing Mendon's growing<br>
    frustration, he comments:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You seem to be making progress.<br>
    You've already eliminated half<br>
    the possibilities.</p>
  <p> Mendon looks up at Wesley, realizes that the youth is<br>
    trying to offer him some support. He nods.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Thank you, but I seem to have<br>
    become efficient a little later<br>
    than was needed. It was my<br>
    responsibility to learn and adapt<br>
    to the Enterprise's regulations.<br>
    I didn't do that.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not really, it was an error.<br>
    Captain Picard may not like them,<br>
    but he does know they can happen<br>
    from time to time.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I failed, I had an opportunity<br>
    to show the captain my superior<br>
    abilities and I failed. I can<br>
    never recover from that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It was a mistake... That's all.<br>
    You didn't put the organism on<br>
    the hull. You discovered it and<br>
    you were attempting to analyze<br>
    it. All you did was mess up a<br>
    little on the ship's protocol.</p>
  <p> Mendon studies Wesley for a few beats. He steps away<br>
    from the console to confer with Wesley in a more<br>
    private fashion.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I know you're trying to be nice<br>
    to me and I appreciate it. What<br>
    I don't understand is why?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why not? I thought you could use<br>
    a friend.</p>
  <p> Mendon eyes Wesley a few beats, then nods his<br>
    acceptance.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Thank you. I only hope I can<br>
    learn your ways before I &quot;mess&quot; up<br>
    again. I imagine my methods seem<br>
    foolish to you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    They are different. But that's<br>
    what this exchange program is all<br>
    about... You learn the way we<br>
    do things and bring that<br>
    information back to your command.<br>
    It's up to you to decide which<br>
    way is better for you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's easy. All you have to do<br>
    is learn.</p>
  <p>61 ANGLE ON MENDON</p>
  <p> He holds for a few beats, confirms seriously:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    You're right. I'll try your<br>
    way...<br>
    (turns back to Science<br>
    Station)<br>
    I'll work even harder than before.<br>
    I'll succeed brilliantly.</p>

    What is the status?</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    Unchanged. The rate of increase<br>

  <p> Kargan contemplates for a beat.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Commander Riker, check the<br>
    organism growth with Engineering.</p>
  <p> Riker seems about to respond but decides the better of<br>
    it. He exits the bridge. After Riker leaves, Kargan<br>
    turns to Klag.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Keep him under scrutiny. I'm<br>
    not sure I trust him.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    I'm not totally convinced that<br>
    Riker knew of any plot against<br>
    us. If he did then why would he<br>
    have come on board?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Because he was ordered to.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    To die?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    To be ordered to die is an<br>
    expectation for any officer at<br>
    any time.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    For a Klingon perhaps, but Riker's<br>
    people do not volunteer for death<br>
    so easily. Even so, Riker may<br>
    be a spy, but he's no coward.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    That only proves that he is<br>
    intelligent and that you may not<br>
    be as strong as you used to be.</p>
  <p>64 ANGLE ON TACTICS OFFICER</p>
  <p> He becomes more alert, announces:</p>

    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    So soon?</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    The Enterprise is on an intercept<br>
    course with us.</p>
  <p> Kargan and Klag react. Riker re-enters the bridge.<br>
    Kargan turns on him in anger.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You almost had me believing that<br>
    perhaps this was a<br>
    misunderstanding.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... So?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    The Enterprise has changed course<br>
    and is following us. Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know. Let's ask them.</p>

  <p> KARGAN<br>
    The reason is obvious. Their<br>
    intent is clear. How long before<br>

  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    Less than fifteen minutes, sir.</p>

    attack against the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>71 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He eyes the captain a few beats.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You must tell me. It is a matter<br>
    of honor and loyalty.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I cannot surrender the secrets<br>
    of Starfleet and the Enterprise<br>
    to you.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Then if your word is no good, how<br>
    can we trust any of your people?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (strong)<br>
    I won't break any vow I took in<br>
    the past. I also swore a loyalty<br>
    to your ship and I will keep that.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    (yelling back)<br>
    They are in conflict!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No sir, they are not! I will obey<br>
    your orders. I will serve this<br>
    ship as first officer, and in an<br>
    attack against the Enterprise I<br>
    will die along with this crew...<br>
    but I will not dishonor my oath<br>
    to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Riker glares at Kargan who holds his stare a beat, then<br>
    nods in agreement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    If you had agreed to disclose<br>
    those facts about the Enterprise<br>
    I would have labelled you a<br>
    traitor and killed you on the<br>
    spot...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Instead you will die with us.<br>
    You will die like a Klingon.</p>
  <p> On Riker -- he nods his acceptance of his fate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So be it.</p>
  <p>72 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> continuing on its orbit at impulse.</p>
  <p>73 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - SCIENCE ONE STATION</p>
  <p> Ensign Mendon studies his screen and then reacts. He<br>
    punches in one more code, seems satisfied and then<br>
    moves from his station towards the captain.</p>
  <p>74 AT COMMAND</p>
  <p> Mendon stands in front of the captain. He is ill at<br>
    ease but trying to maintain what he thinks is the<br>
    proper protocol.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Sir, I have something to report<br>
    to you immediately.</p>
  <p> Worf seems like he's about to reach over the railings<br>
    and snatch Mendon by the skull. Picard restrains his<br>
    actions with a glance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Ensign.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    I have managed to isolate the<br>
    organism on our hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Spare me the technical details...<br>
    just the results.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    They are of a sub-micron form.<br>
    They are controllable and can<br>
    be removed from the hulls of both<br>
    ships.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (relieved, but covers)<br>
    Thank you Ensign, well done.<br>
    Prepare whatever procedures are<br>
    necessary.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, add this<br>
    information to hailing messages.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye sir. Still no response.</p>
  <p> Picard's concerned look.</p>
  <p>75 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The tactics officer motions Klag to his station. Klag<br>
    observes the screen for a few beats then announces:</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    The Enterprise has changed hailing<br>
    messages. They now include a<br>
    promise of cleaning the organisms<br>
    and assisting in repairs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They mean it... They will help.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    And I mean what I say.<br>
    (stronger)<br>
    Arm all weapons... Prepare for<br>
    attack...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>76 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We see only the Enterprise on screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental,<br>
    Stardate 42608.2. Although our<br>
    search has been extensive, we are<br>
    still unable to locate the<br>
    Klingon ship or any debris. The<br>
    absence of both leaves us puzzled<br>
    and somewhat tentative.</p>
  <p>77 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> staffed as in the previous scene. The atmosphere on<br>
    the bridge is tense, all members waiting for Picard's<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Considering the absence of debris,<br>
    it is reasonable to assume the<br>
    Klingon vessel is in the vicinity<br>
    and cloaked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since we do not know their intent<br>
    I recommend we go to Red Alert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thoughtful for a beat)<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> Picard shows the tension of the situation.</p>
  <p>78 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Captain Kargan is intent on his own plan of attack.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    The Enterprise has raised its<br>
    shields.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is normal procedure when<br>
    entering into a suspicious<br>
    situation. The act is not<br>
    aggressive. The Enterprise will<br>
    not fire first.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Then they are fools, for we will.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a beat, then)<br>
    You'll get only one shot.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    We will only need one. Arm all<br>
    phasers and torpedoes. Prepare<br>
    to fire them simultaneously.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I recommend you do not fire<br>
    until you are within forty<br>
    thousand kilometers.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It will reduce their response<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> Both Klag and the captain give Riker a grudging nod of<br>
    admiration.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    You are honoring your promise to<br>
    serve us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Would you do less?</p>
  <p> The Klingons nod their acceptance of this.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    No.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You will give the order to fire,<br>
    Commander Riker.<br>
    (to Klag)<br>
    Call out distances.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Any questions, Mister Riker?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>79 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> his face a mask, the skin drawn tight.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just something I have to say...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... I dispute your judgment. Your<br>
    reasons for forcing this<br>
    confrontation are not valid.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Are you finished?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Then commence with attack as<br>
    ordered.</p>
  <p> Klag begins his countdown...</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Fifty-five thousand kilometers<br>
    and closing.</p>
  <p> Riker removes the small transponder device supplied by<br>
    Worf, looks at it carefully, then glances over to<br>
    Kargan.</p>
  <p>80 KARGAN</p>
  <p> returns his look and then observes the apparatus in<br>
    Riker's hand.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Is that a weapon?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No sir, it is a signaling device.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Hand it to me, Commander.</p>
  <p>81 SCENE</p>
  <p> As Riker steps over to hand it to him, he flips it on.</p>
  <p> Only a small signal light appears on the apparatus...<br>
    He hands it to Kargan who starts to examine it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>82 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf at his station suddenly becomes alert. He adjusts<br>
    a switch and then quickly announces:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are getting an emergency signal<br>
    from a command transponder.<br>
    Location nine-three-five mark<br>
    six-one-three... Frequency<br>
    and code designate it as Commander<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> The members on the bridge become more alert. Troi<br>
    averts her eyes to hide her emotion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (touches com link)<br>
    Chief O'Brien, align with<br>
    emergency transponder signal.</p>
  <p>83 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INTERCUT AS NEEDED</p>
  <p> Empty except for Chief O'Brien.</p>
  <p> CHIEF O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes Captain. We are not yet in<br>
    safe range for a transfer and<br>
    defensive shields are still in<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We may have to stretch it a<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant Worf to the Transporter<br>

    the count.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Yes sir. Forty-five thousand and<br>
    still closing.</p>
  <p> Worf gives Mendon one last warning look, then moves<br>
    from his station.</p>
  <p> MENDON<br>
    Forty-four thousand.</p>

  <p>87 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> The Transporter Chief throws the necessary switches.</p>
  <p>88 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Captain Kargan DEMATERIALIZES in front of the crew.<br>
    Klag is stunned, then reacts.</p>
  <p> Riker has a slight smile on his face, he turns and<br>
    tenses.</p>
  <p> Klag with a growl, advances on Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold where you are Klag. I have<br>
    relieved Captain Kargan. He was<br>
    acting in an irrational manner.<br>
    I am now your captain!!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Serve this ship as I have!</p>
  <p> Klag falters a beat, unsure... then slowly stands<br>
    upright in acceptance. Riker nods.</p>
  <p>89 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Uncertain, Captain Kargan on the pad. He spins his<br>
    head around unsure. Then he spots Worf and crouches.<br>
    Pulaski backs away.</p>
  <p> CHIEF O'BRIEN<br>
    Defensive shields back in place.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am Lieutenant Worf of the<br>
    Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Kargan reacts, screaming out as he reaches for his<br>
    sidearm.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Riker has no honor... He tricked<br>
    me!!</p>
  <p> As Kargan starts to aim his weapon, Worf fires his hand<br>
    phaser. It hits Kargan and he drops. Worf lets out<br>
    a celebration call then:</p>
  <p>90 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Pulaski moves forward quickly, shoves Worf aside to<br>
    examine the prone Captain.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's barely stunned.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with pride)<br>
    Of course, he is a Klingon<br>
    captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>90 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That's great, but where's Will<br>
    Riker?</p>
  <p> Worf reacts for a beat, then helps Kargan to his feet.</p>
  <p>91 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Klag is still tense.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to the Tactics Officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Cloaking shields off.</p>
  <p> The Tactics Officer stalls for a beat, not sure what to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p>92 CLOSER SHOT</p>
  <p> Riker steps forward and blocks his view of any of the<br>
    crew and faces him down.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Obey my orders.</p>
  <p> TACTICS OFFICER<br>
    We will be destroyed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If we are, it will be in battle<br>
    and I will die with you.<br>
    (harder)<br>
    Now, cloaking shields off!</p>

  <p> The Tactics Officer throws the switch.</p>
  <p>94 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Enterprise in its orbit... The Klingon ship Pagh<br>
    suddenly appears from nowhere.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>95 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Pagh appears on the main viewscreen. The bridge<br>
    crew reacts but still remains professional. Captain<br>
    Kargan is also present.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the Pagh sir. It has all<br>

  <p> KARGAN<br>
    They will not believe you.</p>
  <p>96 INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker has heard the Enterprise call. It continues:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Pagh... Do you read me??</p>
  <p> Riker looks around at the Klingon bridge crew. He then<br>
    sounds very much like a Klingon as he bellows out:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enterprise, this is Captain<br>
    William Riker of the Klingon<br>
    vessel, the Pagh.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I order you to lower your shields<br>
    and surrender.</p>
  <p>96A INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The reactions of the crew.</p>
  <p>96B ON PICARD</p>
  <p> A tense look slowly becomes a slight smile.</p>

  <p>96B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lower shields.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Surrender as ordered.</p>
  <p> Kargan steps forward in a rage.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    I demand to be beamed back aboard<br>
    my vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Transporter Chief, prepare to beam<br>
    Captain Kargan aboard the Pagh.<br>
    (to Riker, who has<br>
    heard)<br>
    Captain Riker, preparations are<br>
    ready for immediate repairs to<br>
    your ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard's reaction.</p>
  <p>97 OMITTED</p>
  <p>97A INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Captain Kargan steps onto the bridge. He is tentative,<br>
    unsure. Kargan looks around at the bridge crew who<br>
    eye him with a kind of disapproval and<br>
    uncomfortableness that Kargan recognizes. He turns to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You should have killed me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't want your command.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You tricked me so you could have<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And I give it back to you now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>97B ON KARGAN</p>
  <p> His confidence returns slightly, the force of his<br>
    personality taking over.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Then return to your position.</p>
  <p>97C ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He also senses that he must do something more to return<br>
    Kargan to his proper status. He feels the<br>
    responsibility for placing Kargan in this situation.<br>
    He and Klag exchange a look, a very slight nod passes<br>
    between them, then Riker's look and attitude change to<br>
    one of open insubordination. He almost sneers at<br>
    Kargan.</p>
  <p>97D NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Kargan recognizes it, roars out in fury, charges at<br>
    Riker, and swings a devastating blow with his fist.</p>
  <p>97E SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker is sent skidding across the bridge floor and up<br>
    against the bulkhead where he lies stunned but aware.<br>
    Klag steps next to Riker, then turns to face Kargan...<br>
    Klag's hand reaches down towards his weapon...</p>
  <p>97F CLOSER</p>
  <p> Riker grabs his wrist to restrain him. Klag looks down<br>
    at bruised but alert Riker who gives Klag an eye<br>
    signal.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No more, Captain Kargan...</p>
  <p>97G SCENE</p>
  <p> Kargan fills his chest, glares around the ship, and<br>
    then at Riker... He holds a beat, then orders Klag:</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Get him off my ship!</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>

  <p> Klag reaches down to assist Riker to his feet. Their<br>
    eyes meet. Klag whispers to him.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>

    You understand the Klingons better<br>
    than I thought.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p>102 SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That might be one of the shortest<br>
    assignments in the history of<br>
    Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're wrong, Number One... it<br>
    was almost the longest.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You did well.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you. I learned quite a bit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently not how to duck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Matter of Honor&quot; - 12/02/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>102 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When not to duck would be more<br>
    accurate.</p>
  <p> Picard eyes him a few beats, then smiles...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that was the intention...<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> They both smile. Worf stands in the b.g., hiding all<br>
    emotions and trying to look bored by it all. Riker<br>
    steps over to him...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you. Your little toy<br>
    worked.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'm glad it did, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You come from a very brave and<br>
    unique race. I'm glad you're here<br>
