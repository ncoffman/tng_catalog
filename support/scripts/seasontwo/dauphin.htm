  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Dauphin&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> traveling at warp speed through the black silk of<br>
    space.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is at Ops and WORF at Tactical. RIKER stands<br>
    behind ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. PICARD sits at his<br>
    Command Station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we are approaching<br>
    Klavdia Three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take us to impulse power.</p>
  <p> GIBSON<br>
    Aye, sir. Impulse power.</p>
  <p>2A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise comes out of warp.</p>
  <p>2B INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI is at his position. WESLEY CRUSHER is nearby.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bridge, this is Engineering.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now that we are out of warp, I<br>
    would like to use this time to<br>
    make routine adjustments to the<br>
    deuterium control conduit. It's<br>
    overdue.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2C INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    That would preclude use of our<br>
    warp drive engines.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How much time do these adjustments<br>
    require?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    A few hours, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You may proceed, Lieutenant La<br>
    Forge. Standard orbit.</p>
  <p> GIBSON<br>
    Aye, sir. Standard orbit.</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> establishes orbit about a large yellow planet.</p>
  <p>3A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi crosses to Wesley.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I am going to need an S-C-M, model<br>
    three, from stores.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Right away.</p>
  <p> And he exits.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The glowing planet is featured on the Main Viewer.<br>
    Everyone's at their station except Wesley, who is not<br>
    present. Picard gazes at the image of the planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The image on the Main Viewer enlarges.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not a very inviting planet. Even<br>
    for a research outpost.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I would have thought the<br>
    inhabitants of Daled Four would<br>
    send a future leader to a more<br>
    hospitable environment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For some, security is more<br>
    important than comfort.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But sixteen years...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are being hailed, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing frequencies, Mister<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Captain Picard of the USS<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> The voice transmission comes through with a heavy<br>
    harmonic on the carrier, making it sound like someone<br>
    talking from the bottom of a barrel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The planet's troposphere is<br>
    distorting the signal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Can you clean it up?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'll try.</p>
  <p> Worf makes some adjustments. Then nods to Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Picard -- would you please<br>
    repeat your message?</p>
  <p> FEMALE COM VOICE<br>
    I am Anya. Have you come for<br>
    Salia of Daled Four?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is correct.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    What species are you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Human.</p>
  <p> There is a pause.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Excellent. Bring us aboard. That<br>
    is all.</p>
  <p> The bridge crew registers surprise at Anya's<br>
    sharpness.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Friendly, isn't she?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whether they're friendly or not,<br>
    Salia has the rank of head of<br>
    state. We will treat both her<br>
    and Anya accordingly. Number<br>
    One, Mister Worf, let's greet our<br>
    visitors.</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Worf head for the turbolift.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER PAD<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as TWO FIGURES MATERIALIZE: ANYA, elderly,<br>
    school-marmish; and SALIA, sixteen, gorgeous,<br>
    wide-eyed, but regal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN stands at the controls.<br>
    Picard and Riker focus on Salia, who glances around<br>
    the room, enthusiastically taking in her new<br>
    environment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (re Salia)<br>
    This is Salia of Daled Four.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I didn't feel a thing. Is that<br>
    normal when you are transported,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is.</p>
  <p> Salia steps off the transporter pad and looks toward<br>
    the control console. Anya steps off beside Salia,<br>
    eyes the crew suspiciously.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Those must be the matter/energy<br>
    conversion controls. May I take<br>
    a look?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you like, I'll arrange a tour<br>
    of the ship.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I'd love that.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (firm)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Disappointed, Salia looks at Anya.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That won't be necessary. Just<br>
    show us our quarters, Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Salia. It's obvious she accepts<br>
    Anya's authority.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard leads Salia, Anya toward her quarters. Worf<br>
    and Riker trail.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are housing you in the quarters<br>
    normally reserved for Starfleet<br>
    admiralty. I'm sure you'll find<br>
    them quite comfortable.</p>
  <p>8 ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> as he EXITS a turbolift further down the corridor.<br>
    He carries a superconducting magnet.</p>
  <p>9 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Salia gazes at Wesley, fascinated and attracted. She<br>
    steps away from the entourage and smiles innocently.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    That's a superconducting magnet,<br>
    isn't it?</p>
  <p> Wesley can't take his eyes off her. He can barely get<br>
    his words out.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes... It's a... say, how did you<br>
    know that?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Study, for the last sixteen years<br>
    it is all I could...</p>
  <p> Before she can finish, Anya comes over and pulls Salia<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Please walk ahead with me.</p>
  <p> Salia starts away, then turns back to Wesley.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (tinge of coyness)<br>
    You'd better be careful. I was<br>
    taught those can rip the iron<br>
    right out of your blood cells.</p>
  <p>9A CLOSER - WESLEY AND SALIA</p>
  <p> The attraction of her smile is even stronger than the<br>
    magnet's.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Who are you? No one mentioned<br>
    we were beaming up such a... a...</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Please, Salia.</p>
  <p> Wesley watches as Anya propels Salia into following<br>
    Picard into an intersecting corridor.</p>
  <p> As Riker walks by, Wesley pulls him to the side.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't believe this! Who is she?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    I think she's a governess.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    Not her. The girl.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I doubt she'll have time for you,<br>
    my friend. She's slated to rule<br>
    an entire world.</p>
  <p> Off Wesley's look of determination, we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Enterprise leaves orbit and heads off at<br>
    impulse speed.</p>
  <p>10A INT. WESLEY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Wesley is there alone. He is checking himself out<br>
    in the mirror. The meeting with Salia has suddenly<br>
    made him very aware of his appearance. The magnet he<br>
    was sent for is on his desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The doors open and Data enters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You wanted to see me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data -- the girl who just came on<br>
    board.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Salia of Daled Four.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There's almost nothing in the<br>
    computer about her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Very little is known.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What can you tell me?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She was born on Daled Four. Her<br>
    parents were from opposite sides<br>
    of factions which have been<br>
    feuding for centuries. They died<br>
    shortly after her birth. A<br>
    Federation ship brought her and<br>
    her governess to Klavdia Three<br>
    to be raised in a neutral<br>
    environment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And now she's returning.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is hoped she will unite the<br>
    factions and bring peace.</p>
  <p> The conversation is interrupted.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Wesley, are you all right?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Geordi.<br>
    (then remembering the<br>
    magnet)<br>
    Oh... Yes.. I'm fine... I just...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We are waiting for the part.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> Wesley picks up the part and heads for the door.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Got to go. Thanks, Data.</p>
  <p> Off Data's reaction:</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Minimum bridge crew. Worf is at his Aft Station.<br>
    Riker is in the Command Position.</p>
  <p> Picard enters from the captain's Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we've laid in a course<br>
    for Daled Four. We will remain<br>
    on impulse power until Lieutenant<br>
    La Forge completes his<br>
    adjustments.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Status report on our passengers,<br>
    Lieutenant Worf. Did the<br>
    accommodations meet with their<br>
    approval?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi enters from the turbolift, crosses to Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I doubt anything ever meets with<br>
    that woman's approval, sir.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I'm concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    About... ?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Our new passengers. Their<br>
    emotions do not seem to fit...<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    ... well, who they are and what<br>
    they're doing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (alert)<br>
    Are you suggesting they're not<br>
    who they say they are?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually... no. It's more like<br>
    they're not exactly what they seem<br>
    to be. At least, not exactly.</p>
  <p> Picard puzzles on this a moment, then turns to his<br>
    communications controls.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Picard to Salia's<br>
    quarters. May I turn on the<br>
    viewer?</p>
  <p> SALIA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, of course.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to Worf, who puts Salia's quarters on the<br>
    Main Viewer. Both he and Troi watch intently as:</p>
  <p>12 INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are your quarters satisfactory?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Yes. Very.</p>
  <p> Anya enters from an adjoining room.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank you for checking on us,<br>
    Captain. I only hope my quarters<br>
    on Daled Four will be this<br>
    luxurious.</p>
  <p> Picard quickly assesses the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Feel free to contact me if you<br>
    need anything. Picard out.</p>
  <p> The Main Viewer goes blank.</p>
  <p> END INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>13 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What I sensed in that seems<br>
    entirely normal. Emotionally,<br>
    I judge her to be very drawn to<br>
    our young ensign.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What puzzles me, Captain, is how<br>
    she is expected to bring peace<br>
    to Daled Four. The one thing<br>
    we do know about it is that its<br>
    inhabitants have been fighting<br>
    throughout their recorded history.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do we know about the cause<br>
    of their wars?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Only that it is the difference<br>
    between night and day.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, you just used a<br>
    colloquialism.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I did? I meant that Daled Four<br>
    does not rotate. One side has<br>
    constant night, the other constant<br>
    daylight. One might surmise that<br>
    the two hemispheres developed<br>
    disparate cultures, which is a<br>
    major cause of most wars.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet somehow this child is<br>
    supposed to bring them together.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She looks too delicate for a task<br>
    like that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not be fooled by her looks.<br>
    The body is just a shell.</p>
  <p>14 OMITTED</p>
  <p>15 INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Salia is with an unusually dressed TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    (definitely not a &quot;normal&quot; inhabitant of the<br>
    Enterprise).</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    How can I be a leader if I don't<br>
    know anything about my people?</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    You will lead because you are<br>
    accepted by both sides. And<br>
    because it is in your blood.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    What am I expected to do when I<br>
    get there?</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    You will know.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    You just will. Salia, you must<br>
    arrive with an open mind, without<br>
    preconceived ideas about the world<br>
    you will find or the people on<br>
    either side.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    It's very frustrating.</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    Yes -- I know. You feel the weight<br>
    of so much responsibility. And<br>
    you're not sure you can live up<br>
    to everyone's expectations.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    It's not only that. Nobody's<br>
    asked me if this is something I<br>
    want.</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    It is your duty.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I have no choice.</p>
  <p> TEENAGE GIRL<br>
    None. It won't be as bad as you<br>
    think. In fact it could be quite<br>
    wonderful. Besides... you are<br>
    the last and only chance.</p>
  <p> Salia holds the teenage girl's eyes for a beat... then,<br>
    steps to the window and stares out at the stars. After<br>
    a moment, Salia looks down.</p>
  <p>16 SALIA'S POV</p>
  <p> A cute FURRY ANIMAL rubs against Salia's leg.</p>
  <p>17 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Salia sighs and pets it.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (to animal, troubled)<br>
    Don't you think I'm going to need<br>
    more than instinct to do whatever<br>
    is expected of me on Daled Four?</p>

    Wesley?</p>
  <p>19 WESLEY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stands on the lower catwalk, at the Deuterium Control<br>
    Conduit. He's daydreaming as he holds a fiber optics<br>
    laser probe that looks like a screwdriver with a blade<br>
    of pure VIOLET light.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    (louder)<br>
    Wesley! Haven't you found the<br>
    defocused area yet?</p>
  <p> Wesley snaps out of his daydream.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm looking!</p>
  <p>20 ANGLE TO INCLUDE GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> who is now leaning over the catwalk, staring down at<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I see the way you're looking.</p>
  <p> Wesley whirls and drops his instrument.</p>
  <p>21 THE INSTRUMENT</p>
  <p> bounces, almost falling off the catwalk.</p>
  <p>22 SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sorry.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He retrieves the probe.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've got my mind on something.</p>
  <p> There's a beat. Finally, Wesley explodes with<br>
    excitement.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Geordi, this girl they beamed up,<br>
    she's... she's perfect! Perfect!</p>
  <p> Geordi shakes his head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Now I understand why you can't<br>
    concentrate.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'll do better.</p>
  <p> Geordi starts back to his console as Wesley turns a<br>
    dial on the probe and a GREEN stem of light appears.<br>
    He touches it so that the blade of light penetrates the<br>
    conduit.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Warning -- resonant field applied!<br>
    Warning!</p>
  <p> Wesley pulls the probe from the conduit as Geordi<br>
    rushes back.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> Wesley adjusts the probe so that the stem changes from<br>
    GREEN to VIOLET.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (apologetic)<br>
    I had it on the wrong setting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I suppose it had to happen to you.<br>
    It usually does at about this age.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What usually does?</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Glands suddenly meshing together.<br>
    It happens to all of us.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You've got to be joking. Just<br>
    because I said she's<br>
    interesting...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You said she's &quot;perfect.&quot;<br>
    (waves)<br>
    Go. You're no use here for now.<br>
    Go talk to her. Take the lift.</p>
  <p> Wesley ignores and hops down beside Geordi and starts<br>
    for the exit. Suddenly he stops - insecure again.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's silly, Geordi.<br>
    (hesitates)<br>
    Well, since you recommend it...<br>
    If she'll talk to me, how should<br>
    I approach her? What would I say?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just say &quot;Hi. I'm Wesley Crusher.<br>
    I'd like to talk to you.&quot;</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And then what?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Whatever occurs to you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What if nothing occurs to me?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Wesley, I don't really have time<br>
    for this. You're going to have<br>
    to ask somebody else.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Okay.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks discouraged, turns and exits.</p>
  <p>23 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON WORF</p>
  <p> as he ROARS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data is at Command, an n.d. crewmember at Ops and<br>
    ENSIGN GIBSON at Conn. They all look on in puzzlement<br>
    as Worf stops in mid-roar and calmly continues<br>
    speaking to Wesley, who stands beside him at Tactical.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is how the Klingon lures a<br>
    mate.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Are you telling me to go yell at<br>
    Salia?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. Men do not roar. Women roar.<br>
    Then they hurl heavy objects.<br>
    And claw at you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What does the man do?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He reads love poetry. He ducks<br>
    a lot.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, well, that might work for<br>
    Klingons, but I think I should<br>
    try something less dangerous.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then go to her door. Beg like<br>
    a human.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It should be that simple, Wesley.<br>
    Judging by her appearance it is<br>
    likely you and Salia are<br>
    biologically compatible. Of<br>
    course, there may be a difference<br>
    in the histocompatibility complex<br>
    in the cell membrane.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Data! I want to meet her, not<br>
    dissect her.</p>
  <p> Wesley walks to the turbolift just as Picard exits it.<br>
    Hold on Picard as he crosses the bridge.</p>

  <p> Salia sits on her bed. The furry animal is nearby.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    May I activate the viewer?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> Picard's image appears on the viewer in Salia's living<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (on viewscreen)<br>
    I've arranged for Anya to have<br>
    a tour of the ship. Maybe you'd<br>
    like to go along.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Very much.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (on viewscreen)<br>
    Your escort will be there shortly.<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p> As the viewscreen goes blank, Salia immediately stands<br>
    and looks for the animal, which quickly scurries into<br>
    the open.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I think I'll go on the tour.</p>
  <p> The animal races over.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>

    This is ridiculous! This will<br>

  <p> A look of anticipation crosses Salia's face as the<br>
    animal begins to QUIVER, then SHAKE.</p>

    and obey me for the rest of this<br>
    trip.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    You're no more an old woman than<br>
    I am a leader.</p>
  <p> The CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Yes. Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Worf enters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am here to escort you on a tour<br>
    of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    I will be right there.<br>

  <p>28 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Wesley sits with Riker at the bar. GUINAN watches them<br>
    from behind the bar.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But what do I say? How should<br>
    I act? What do I do?</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Guinan and motions toward a nearby empty<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Guinan, I need your help. Could<br>
    you sit over there?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That seems simple enough.</p>
  <p> Guinan walks around the bar and heads for a table.<br>
    Riker and Wesley follow. Guinan sits. Riker sits<br>
    beside her. Wesley stands off to the side.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    The first words out of your mouth<br>
    are the most important. You could<br>
    start by saying something like...<br>
    (turns to Guinan)<br>
    ... &quot;you're the most beautiful<br>
    woman in the galaxy.&quot;</p>
  <p> Riker holds the look for a moment, then turns back to<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But that might not work.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes it would.</p>
  <p> Riker is relieved and amused. This is going to be fun.<br>
    He turns to Guinan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you only knew how much I wanted<br>
    to tell you that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But you were afraid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Of me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of us. Of what we could become...</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and that you might have<br>
    thought it was a line.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Maybe I do think it's a line.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you think I'm not sincere?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I didn't say that. There's<br>
    nothing wrong with a line. It's<br>
    like a knock on the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you're inviting me in?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I'm not sending you away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's more than I expected.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But is it more than you hoped?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To hope is to recognize the<br>
    possibility. I had only dreams.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Dreams can be dangerous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not these dreams.</p>
  <p> He looks into her eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I dream of a galaxy where your<br>
    eyes are stars... And all the<br>
    universe worships night.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Careful, if you place me too high<br>
    on a pedestal, you won't be able<br>
    to reach me.</p>

  <p> ANYA<br>
    (suspicious)<br>
    What is that? What are you doing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is the Deuterium Control<br>
    Conduit. I'm probing it to find<br>
    a defocused area.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Is there a problem with the ship?</p>
  <p> Geordi responds to the seriousness of her tone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's nothing to be concerned<br>
    about. I'm just making routine<br>
    adjustments.</p>
  <p> There's a pause as Anya assesses Geordi.</p>

  <p> Wesley confidently rounds the corner on his way to<br>
    Salia's quarters. He slows down, a little less<br>
    confident, as he spots a guard, ARON, outside her door.<br>
    The closer he gets, the more uneasy he becomes.</p>
  <p> ARON<br>
    Ensign Crusher, what are you doing<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> There's an awkward moment as Wesley tries to build the<br>
    courage to call on Salia... but he can't go through<br>
    with it. Suddenly Salia's door slides open. Salia<br>
    and he lock eyes. Wesley's jaw drops. Again, he's<br>
    thunderstruck.</p>
  <p> ARON<br>
    Is there a problem?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (eyes still on Wesley)<br>
    Can you show me how to work the<br>
    food dispenser?</p>
  <p> ARON<br>
    Sure.</p>
  <p> As Aron starts to enter her quarters, Salia motions<br>
    toward Wesley.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (to Aron)<br>
    No, I meant him.</p>
  <p>32 INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley and Salia stand in front of the food dispenser.<br>
    He's nervous in her presence and glad to have something<br>
    mundane to talk about.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Actually all you have to do is<br>
    tell the computer what you want<br>
    and it will prepare it for you.</p>

  <p> SALIA<br>
    I'd like something sweet.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know... Computer, Thalian<br>
    chocolate mousse.</p>
  <p> A dish of mousse is provided. Salia dips her finger<br>
    into the mousse and slowly licks it off. She closes<br>
    her eyes and concentrates on the taste.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    It's a wonderful sensation.</p>

  <p> Worf and the monster push against each other's power.<br>
    Worf is surprised by the monster's increasing strength,<br>
    it ever so slightly gaining the advantage.</p>
  <p> Pulaski anxiously pushes the bed away from the battle.</p>
  <p> The monster begins to pull Worf to the side. Soon<br>
    there will be nothing in its path to Hennesey.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, doors on both sides slide open. THREE<br>
    SECURITY PERSONNEL rush in -- phasers ready. They train<br>
    their weapons at the monster. Worf is in their line<br>
    of fire.</p>
  <p> Picard enters. After a tense moment, the monster<br>
    slowly releases Worf.</p>

    She wants to kill Hennesey!</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    His disease threatens Salia!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Captain, there is no chance of<br>
    contagion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Anya)<br>
    The situation is under control.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    That's not good enough!</p>
  <p> Picard barely contains his rage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It will have to be.</p>
  <p> Anya moves close to Picard. Her eyes are filled with<br>
    fury.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Your powers are infinitesimal<br>
    compared to mine!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nevertheless, you will obey my<br>
    orders. You are to remain in your<br>
    quarters and in your present form<br>
    for the remainder of this voyage.<br>
    Is that clear?</p>
  <p> Anya glares at Picard for a long moment.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep her under guard.</p>
  <p> Worf motions to the two security personnel, who lead<br>
    Anya out of the room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What kind of creature is she?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've never seen anything like her.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    There are no such life-forms in<br>
    the galactic zoological catalog.<br>
    There have been rumors of a<br>
    species called allasomorphs which<br>
    are supposed to possess the power<br>
    to alter their molecular structure<br>
    into that of other life-forms.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Such a species would make a<br>
    perfect &quot;protector.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want a security team stationed<br>
    outside Sickbay, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir. Captain... if Anya<br>
    transforms?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    (to Anya)<br>
    You are restricted to these<br>

  <p> Anya enters. There is an exchange of looks between<br>
    Worf and Anya as the doors close.</p>
  <p>43 INT. SALIA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Anya steps in, anxiously glances around for Salia.</p>
  <p>44 INT. HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley and Salia stand watching a spectacular display<br>
    of shooting stars. Both are mesmerized.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Can a place so remarkable truly<br>
    exist?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, yes. And there are so many<br>
    more -- all special - -all so<br>
    different. And all the different<br>
    kinds of life-forms.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I have learned about them. That<br>
    is all I did on Klavdia Three...<br>
    was learn. I know so much, but<br>
    I've seen so little.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Then, think of what you have to<br>
    look forward to. This is the best<br>
    time to be alive.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    For you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    For us both. Everything is just<br>
    beginning. We've only charted<br>
    nineteen percent of our galaxy...<br>
    the rest is out there -- waiting<br>
    for us. And already, look at<br>
    what we've discovered.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I have never seen anything so<br>
    wondrous.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Wait. Computer -- Rosseau Five.</p>
  <p> SUDDENLY, they are standing on a tiny point of land,<br>
    which seems to drop off to infinity. Salia is<br>
    startled, and quickly moves closer to Wesley. Around<br>
    them spin little brightly lighted moons, which splash<br>
    color on their faces. It's breathtaking.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I can't believe a place like this<br>
    really exists.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, yes.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    And you have been there?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    And one day you'll visit Rosseau<br>
    Five... and other places and more<br>
    spectacular than this.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    If only that were possible.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Now, listen. In a moment the<br>
    orbits of the moons will become<br>
    synchronous.</p>
  <p> And as they watch the orbits of the moons close, and<br>
    slowly a wondrous sound begins... a single note which<br>
    builds to a chord.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    It is so beautiful -- like this<br>
    place has a voice and is trying<br>
    to talk with us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I never thought of it that way.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Thank you for sharing all of this<br>
    with me.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Soon you'll see it for yourself.</p>
  <p> Salia is suddenly pensive.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I don't think so.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Maybe we should go.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    How about something to drink?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (brightens)<br>
    How about some more of that<br>
    Thalian chocolate?</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles. He has never been happier.</p>
  <p>45 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD</p>
  <p> sits at his desk, talking to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have obviously brought a very<br>
    dangerous life-form aboard this<br>
    ship. I want to minimize the<br>
    chances of another incident.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, whatever kind of<br>
    life-form Anya may be,<br>
    emotionally she is really Salia's<br>
    mother.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And the most dangerous animal is<br>
    a mother protecting her young.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>

  <p> ANYA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, this is Anya.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> ANYA'S COM VOICE<br>
    (furious)<br>
    Salia is gone. Where is she?</p>
  <p>46 INT. TEN-FORWARD - ON WESLEY AND SALIA</p>
  <p> sitting face to face. A backdrop of stars adds to the<br>
    romantic mood, but they're oblivious to everything<br>
    except the enchantment of each other's eyes.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    This has all been so wonderful.<br>
    I'm not sure it's real.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Believe me, the Ten-Forward room<br>
    is not an illusion.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Not that. I mean the way I feel.</p>
  <p> Wesley's heart quickens. Suddenly he's dizzy and<br>
    confused with excitement.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (sotto to Wesley)<br>
    Tell her about her eyes.</p>
  <p> Wesley and Salia look toward the voice. Wesley's<br>
    embarrassed.</p>
  <p>47 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Guinan stands at the table with two dishes of Thalian<br>
    chocolate mousse. She winks at Wesley and hands them<br>
    each a dish.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You won't find a better dish of<br>
    chocolate on Thalos or Daled Four.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles and walks away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (voice trails off)<br>
    I'm sure I won't...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I've had a great time being with<br>
    you, Wesley.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That makes you sad?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    When I was on Klavdia Three all<br>
    I could think of was leaving that<br>
    isolation.</p>
  <p> Wesley is surprised.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Is that what awaits you on Daled<br>
    Four?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But I thought you were going there<br>
    to unite two groups which have<br>
    been fighting.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (a little surprised that<br>
    he knew that)<br>
    What else do you know?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Very little. There is almost<br>
    nothing in the ship's computer<br>
    about Daled Four. What will you<br>
    do there?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Your language has no word for the<br>
    position I will hold. I only know<br>
    I will have a lot of duties when<br>
    I get there. In many ways I'll<br>
    have even less freedom than I did<br>
    on Klavdia Three.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> It takes Wesley a long moment to absorb this. Then<br>
    he steels himself and blurts out his greatest hope.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You could stay.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    On the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> Another pause -- this is a big emotional risk for<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Because...</p>
  <p> Salia's confused. He's offering her a possibility she<br>
    never dreamed of. She looks deep into his eyes, stands<br>
    up and rushes out the door, leaving Wesley feeling<br>
    bewildered and rejected. Guinan approaches.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Just because a girl runs out,<br>
    doesn't mean she's not hoping<br>
    you'll follow.</p>
  <p>48 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Salia walks down the corridor, weeping. She wipes at<br>
    her tears and stares with confusion at her wet hand<br>
    as if she's never cried before. She increases her<br>
    pace. Wesley catches up to her.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (as they walk)<br>
    What is it? What happened?</p>
  <p> Salia doesn't respond.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Salia!</p>
  <p> Salia stops and turns to Wesley.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Stay away from me!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Salia continues down the corridor, leaving Wesley<br>
    frozen. An inner turbulence of rejection, upset and<br>
    confusion makes it impossible for him to move. After<br>
    several steps, Salia again stops and turns to face him.<br>
    She fights to hold back the tears.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Only the glimmer of hope makes it possible for Wesley<br>
    to speak.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Wesley, I can't stay here! I<br>
    can't have this life! I want it<br>
    more than anything, but I can't<br>
    have it!</p>
  <p> Wesley walks toward her, suddenly radiant with hope<br>
    and enthusiasm -- she wants to stay!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Salia, nothing is impossible!</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Not for you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    There's a way. I know there is!</p>
  <p> He takes her hands in his. She stiffens her arms for<br>
    a moment, then relaxes. They lock eyes. She's<br>
    beginning to believe he might be right and he feels<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> ANYA (O.S.)<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    Leave her alone!</p>
  <p>49 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Wesley and Salia turn with a start to see Picard and<br>
    Anya outside the turbolift a few feet away. Behind<br>
    them are Anya's two guards. Anya eyes Wesley with<br>
    a burning glare.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (stern, a hint of<br>
    tension)<br>
    Wesley, step away from her.</p>
  <p> Wesley reluctantly complies.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (to Salia)<br>
    Come with me.</p>
  <p> Salia shoots Wesley a glance of despair, then walks<br>
    toward Anya. On Wesley's disturbed look, we:</p>

    Yes. She is not just the<br>

  <p> ANYA<br>
    There's always danger from one<br>

  <p> SALIA<br>
    Then you want me to stay.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Does Anya know you're here?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    That doesn't matter.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I'm glad you came. I thought<br>
    Anya would have kept you with<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I have certain rights.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    In other words, you slipped away.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    While Anya was asleep.</p>
  <p> Wesley laughs.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm sorry if you got in trouble<br>
    with your captain.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm not in trouble... yet.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Anya was afraid you would corrupt<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Wesley smiles.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    With my wild way of life?</p>
  <p> Salia moves close.</p>

  <p> SALIA<br>
    Maybe... with the normal things<br>
    people do... when they like each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> She pushes a lock of hair from his forehead. Wesley<br>
    can feel himself coming apart. He slowly moves his<br>
    lips to hers. They kiss.</p>
  <p>58A CLOSE ON WESLEY AND SALIA</p>
  <p> lost in deep, passionate kisses. Finally, they come up<br>
    for air.</p>

  <p>60 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> SUDDENLY there is a roar... Wesley looks up to see<br>
    a monster in the doorway. Anya (as the monster) moves<br>
    into the room.</p>
  <p>61 WESLEY</p>
  <p> Startled... jumps back. He instinctively places his<br>
    body between the monster and Salia.</p>
  <p>62 SCENE</p>
  <p> In a frenzy, her eyes full of fire and fury, the<br>
    monster advances.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (touches his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Security to crew quarters!</p>
  <p> SALIA (O.S.)<br>
    No... Anya... NO!</p>
  <p> The monster continues to advance.</p>
  <p> From behind Wesley hears a ROAR.</p>
  <p> He turns... the sound is coming from deep within Salia<br>
    -- SUDDENLY, she transforms into a monster even more<br>
    frightening than Anya.</p>

    You should not have disobeyed me.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I had to.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    I warned you to leave her alone.</p>
  <p> Before Wesley can respond, the security team, led by<br>
    Worf, arrives.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are not supposed to be here.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    We are leaving.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Escort them both to their<br>
    quarters. And secure it with<br>
    a forcefield.</p>
  <p> As they leave Salia turns back and she and Wesley hold<br>
    a look.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>72 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits the yellow planet Daled Four.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental.<br>
    Since Anya's powers of<br>
    transformation apparently gave<br>
    her the ability to escape her<br>
    guards unnoticed, we have sealed<br>
    her quarters with a forcefield<br>
    that will contain her no matter<br>
    how small a form she may take.</p>
  <p>73 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker are at their forward stations. Worf<br>
    is at Tactical, Data has Ops and Ensign Gibson mans<br>
    Conn.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Meanwhile we remain unable to<br>
    communicate with Daled Four.</p>
  <p> Worf adjusts a control at his Tactical Station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain -- I'm receiving an audio<br>
    signal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Audio on.</p>
  <p> VOICE<br>
    (crackling with static)<br>
    Come in...<br>
    (static)<br>
    This is...<br>
    (static)<br>
    of Daled Four.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, sensors indicate the<br>
    communication originated from a<br>
    gigawatt source on the planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's more power than our entire<br>
    ship can generate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is what is needed to penetrate<br>
    the atmosphere.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which means we lack the ability<br>
    to respond...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, there are beam-down<br>
    coordinates encoded within the<br>
    carrier signal.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a look. They're relieved<br>
    that they'll finally be able to get rid of their<br>
    troublesome passengers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Splendid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll arrange for our guests to<br>

  <p> Two guards flank the doorway. There is a bluish tinge<br>
    indicating a forcefield. Worf approaches.</p>

  <p> Salia hears the CHIME.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have arrived.</p>
  <p> Anya appears from the other room</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Salia will be with you in just<br>
    a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>78B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf nods and steps back.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    You're not going?</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    No. My duties have been<br>
    completed. I have done all that<br>
    I could. I hope it's been enough<br>
    and that I did not fail you.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    You raised me well, and I thank<br>
    you for that.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Don't be angry at me. I would<br>
    not have harmed the boy, I only<br>
    wanted to frighten him.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    You are ready for what awaits you<br>
    and you will do well. I know that<br>
    I have been tough on you, but it's<br>
    because I want you to be prepared<br>
    for whatever you may be required<br>
    to do.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Will I ever be able to leave Daled<br>
    Four?</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    Probably not. But, anything is<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    That's what Wes said.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    I hope he is right.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Where will you go?</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    The third moon is within range<br>
    of this ship's transporter, I will<br>
    go there.</p>

  <p>78B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I am going to miss you.</p>
  <p> ANYA<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> There is a long pause. Salia turns and walks to the<br>
    exit. The door opens.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (to the guard)<br>
    I am ready.</p>
  <p> ARON<br>
    Computer - field off.</p>
  <p> The field disappears. Salia exits her quarters.</p>
  <p>78C INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> As Salia and Aron near the Transporter Room, she sees<br>
    Wesley standing off to the side.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> For a moment he does not respond. Then:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Was it fun?</p>
  <p> She moves toward him. The guard stays a discreet<br>
    distance away.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Playing humanoid. Was it fun?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (hurt)<br>
    Wesley, look at me. Right now<br>
    -- this moment -- this is what I<br>
    am. A humanoid girl.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But what are you really?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Does it matter?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>78C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I'm sorry I hurt your feelings<br>
    -- I didn't mean to.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I loved you.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I love you, too.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Can you?</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Yes, oh... yes. I have the same<br>
    feeling -- the same emotions as<br>
    you. It's time for me to go.</p>
  <p> Wesley holds her look for a moment -- then she turns<br>
    and walks toward the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>79 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM THREE</p>
  <p> Riker stands with Salia. The Transporter Chief<br>
    attends the controls.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Prepare to beam Salia to the<br>
    specified coordinates.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Our world is grateful for the<br>
    courtesy which you have<br>
    extended us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope some day Daled Four and<br>
    the Federation will have formal<br>
    contact.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    That is my wish as well.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    Coordinates set, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>

  <p> Salia takes her place on the pad.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Transporter Chief)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> The doors SWOOSH open and Wesley steps into the room.<br>
    He has a dish of Thalian chocolate mousse.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Wait!</p>
  <p> Salia's face brightens. The transporter chief looks to<br>
    Riker. Riker gestures for him to wait with the<br>
    transport. Wesley steps to the pad.</p>
  <p>80 ANGLE ON WESLEY, SALIA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Wesley hands her the bowl of mousse.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A taste to remember me by.</p>
  <p> Salia dips her finger in the mousse and gazes at it as<br>
    if this is the last time she will experience the<br>
    sensation of taste.</p>
  <p> She slowly licks it off, then hands the bowl to her<br>
    escort.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I wish there were something I<br>
    could give you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You already have.</p>
  <p> She steps forward and gives him an embrace.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    I'm glad you came to say good-bye.<br>
    Thank you... for everything.</p>
  <p> They separate.</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want you to leave now.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Dauphin&quot; - 12/23/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SALIA<br>
    Because I cannot arrive on my<br>
    planet in this form and I want<br>
    you to remember me as I am now.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We have had enough disguises<br>
    between us. It's time for the<br>
    truth.</p>
  <p> Salia nods, then steps up on the transporter pad.<br>
    After a moment, she raises her arms. Then TRANSMUTES<br>
    -- not in the violent, quivering manner as before, but<br>
    gracefully and sensually -- into a luminous form of such<br>
    beauty and elegance that it takes Wesley's breath away.<br>
    The glow from this creature lights his face and he<br>
    smiles... totally enraptured.</p>
  <p> For a moment it is only Wesley and this creature.<br>
    Then:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> And the transporter chief hits the controls and they<br>
    all watch transfixed as the form BEAMS OUT.</p>

  <p>85 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Seeing her on the transporter<br>
    pad was like seeing pure light.<br>
    (he pauses)<br>
    I miss her. I feel so empty.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I know that sensation.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'm never going to feel this way<br>
    about anyone else.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You're right.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks up.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I didn't expect you to say that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Oh, there will be others -- but,<br>
    the next time you feel love will<br>
    be different. Each time is<br>
    different.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Knowing that doesn't make it any<br>
    easier.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It isn't supposed to.</p>
  <p> Wesley nods -- then rises.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I better get back to my duties.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Me too.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles.</p>
  <p>86 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Wesley exits the turbolift. Riker is at his Command<br>
    Position. Data's at Ops, Worf at Tactical. Wesley<br>
    goes to Conn and takes over from Ensign Gibson. A<br>
    wedge of Daled Four, surrounded by a field of stars,<br>
    is visible on the Main Viewer.</p>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Done, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses a moment as Wesley looks at the Main<br>
    Viewer. To Wesley, the heavenly bodies symbolize<br>
    discovery, excitement and love. For now, there is also<br>
    sadness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p> Wesley engages the warp drive and watches Daled Four<br>
    disappear from the Main Viewer.</p>
