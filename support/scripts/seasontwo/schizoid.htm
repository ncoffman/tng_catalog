    &quot;The Schizoid Man&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a small speck heading toward us from a great distance.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (V.O.)<br>
    Medical log, Stardate 42437.5.<br>
    Ira Graves is arguably the<br>
    greatest human mind in the known<br>
    universe...</p>
  <p> The great ship streaks by, racing toward its<br>
    destination.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For years he's lived in near<br>
    isolation on a remote planet,<br>
    devoting full time to his<br>
    revolutionary work...</p>
  <p>2 INT. TURBOLIFT - CLOSE ON PULASKI</p>
  <p> riding up alone.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Eight hours ago, we monitored a<br>
    message from his assistant,<br>
    urgently requesting medical aid.<br>
    It seems Graves' health is failing<br>
    rapidly -- I only hope we can<br>
    reach him in time...</p>
  <p>3 STAY WITH PULASKI</p>
  <p> as the lift stops and she steps out onto the bridge.<br>
    Before her, WESLEY is at Conn, a CREWMAN at Ops, WORF<br>
    at Tactical. She MOVES to Command to join RIKER and<br>
    PICARD...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any response from Gravesworld,<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nothing sir. Not since their<br>
    initial communication.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns. Riker turns to Pulaski...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They send out a plea for help,<br>
    then shut off the transmitters<br>
    so they can't tell if help's on<br>
    the way. Doesn't make much sense,<br>
    does it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's our e.t.a. at the planet,<br>
    Mister Crusher?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thirty-six minutes to orbit, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Pulaski -- his question more a<br>
    statement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You understand the importance of<br>
    doing everything we can for Doctor<br>
    Graves.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Of course, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet Command believes his<br>
    work in quantum physics is<br>
    reaching a critical stage. They<br>
    consider this a priority one<br>
    action.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    A man is ill, Captain. Treating<br>
    him is my priority one.<br>
    Regardless of who he is.</p>
  <p> Picard raises his eyebrows in mild surprise. Is she<br>
    sparring with him or merely stating a fact? Behind<br>
    him, Riker is smiling, amused by her blunt way of<br>
    saying things.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TEN-FORWARD ROOM - CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> downing a sea-green liquid in an exotic &quot;chaser&quot; glass.<br>
    She savors the drink, her eyes lighting up as she<br>
    slowly swallows.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's wonderful. What is it?</p>
  <p>5 PULL BACK</p>
  <p> to see GEORDI and TWO CREWPERSONS sitting next to her,<br>
    with GUINAN behind the bar.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A year on the planet Thurasia is<br>
    four hundred and ninety days long.<br>
    It rains twice, and only twice.<br>
    You're drinking Thurasian rain<br>
    water.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (empty glass in hand)<br>
    Water? Tastes more like...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Heaven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly. Where can I get some<br>
    more of this?</p>
  <p> Guinan takes his glass with a smile.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    'Fraid that's the last of it.<br>
    Next rainfall in a hundred and<br>
    sixty three days.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at her empty glass wistfully.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure I can wait that long.</p>
  <p>6 ANGLE TO INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> joining his friends at the bar.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Hey, old friend. Any luck?</p>
  <p> Data looks extremely satisfied.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe my quest has ended in<br>
    complete success.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to the others and explains what they're<br>
    referring to...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data's been scouring the library,<br>
    in search of the perfect joke.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have explored seventy-six<br>
    thousand, two hundred and<br>
    twenty-three anecdotes thus far.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is an attempt to find the most<br>
    humorous anecdote in recorded<br>
    history. And I believe I have<br>
    done just that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    This I gotta hear.</p>
  <p> All eyes are on Data -- everyone's primed to hear the<br>
    anecdote to end all anecdotes. Data's eyes sparkle in<br>
    anticipation. Just before he begins, he throws back<br>
    his head and LAUGHS THAT PECULIAR STILTED LAUGH of his,<br>
    as if to say &quot;boy is this going to be funny.&quot; The laugh<br>
    ends too abruptly, like someone pulled a plug.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (deliberate)<br>
    There were twelve birds sitting<br>
    on a fence... Six had a notion<br>
    to fly away. How many were left?</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE ON HIS AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> looking at one another, thinking this better have a<br>
    great punchline. Geordi shrugs...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, I'll bite. Six.</p>
  <p> Data bursts into his awkward laugh again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (happy, glowing)<br>
    No, twelve! They only had a<br>
    notion to fly away!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> With quick mechanical movements, Data looks from person<br>
    to person, a stiff smile plastered on his face. The<br>
    smile fades, replaced by a look of complete surprise.<br>
    He can't believe the others aren't laughing. In fact,<br>
    the only sound WE HEAR is A SMALL GROAN emanating from<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You did not find it wildly<br>
    hilarious?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates the others. Some have stone-faces<br>
    while others look like they've just been slapped.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I should have described<br>
    the interesting plumage of --</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    -- Data honey, I don't think it<br>
    would've helped. That joke<br>
    chilled my blood.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles and shivers. Geordi EXITS the bar,<br>
    patting a deeply perplexed Data on the shoulder as he<br>
    goes.</p>
  <p>8 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - MOVING WITH GEORDI</p>
  <p> as he crosses to Ops, passing Picard, Riker and Pulaski<br>
    in the Command Area.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Receiving a transmission from<br>
    Gravesworld, sir. It's unfocused.<br>
    Not directed specifically at us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p>9 ON SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> KAREEN BRIANON a strikingly beautiful if somewhat<br>
    frail-looking woman in her early twenties. She seems<br>
    anxious -- nervously looking over her shoulder as she<br>
    speaks. We join her transmission in progress...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    ... If anyone can hear me, please<br>
    send a doctor. Things are getting<br>
    worse --</p>
  <p> Kareen cuts off as she turns to look at something else<br>
    in the room. Suddenly the screen goes dead...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try and raise her, Mister Crusher.<br>
    Tell them we're minutes away.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's no good, sir. I don't<br>
    believe they're receiving us.</p>
  <p> Picard paces, clearly frustrated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Our records show that she and<br>
    Graves are the only ones living<br>
    on the planet, Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then what scared her?</p>
  <p>10 MOVE IN ON PICARD</p>
  <p> wondering the same thing.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Same setting, same situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, I'm picking up another<br>
    signal... but it's not from the<br>
    planet.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Confirmed. Point of origin...<br>
    sector three-five mark seven.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Signal is very weak, sir. Audio<br>
    only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Pipe it through, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> THE SOUND OF CRACKLING STATIC fills the air.</p>
  <p> MAN'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... Mayday! Mayday! This is<br>
    (static)<br>
    -- questing emergency assistance.<br>
    (static)<br>
    Outer hull breached<br>
    (static)<br>
    Environmental systems compro --<br>
    (static)<br>
    Need immediate</p>
  <p> ROLLING WAVES OF STATIC overwhelm the rest of the<br>
    message. Picard signals Geordi to cut off the noise.<br>
    Worf punches in a few commands at his position...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I show the Mary Rogers in that<br>
    general vicinity, Captain. She's<br>
    a transport ship, used to ferry<br>
    settlers to new colonies. No<br>
    other ships of any kind in this<br>
    sector.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Outer hull breached -- their air<br>
    must be leaking out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    There may be hundreds of colonists<br>
    aboard that ship. We've got to<br>
    help them!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what about Graves?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's one man. And we don't even<br>
    know the nature of his illness.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He's the man we came to assist!<br>
    I have my orders, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Pulaski stews -- silence reigns on the bridge. This is<br>
    difficult for Picard; a tragic, no-win situation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Suggestion, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard swivels to face Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Suggest we execute long range<br>
    transport of away team to assist<br>
    Dr. Graves at earliest possible<br>
    moment. We can use the mass of<br>
    the planet to slingshot us toward<br>
    the stricken liner, thus making<br>
    up most of the lost time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nodding, thoughtful)<br>
    Mister Crusher, make it so -- prepare<br>
    for extended touch and go orbit.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (complying)<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The transport may be a bit tricky.<br>
    I'd like you to handle it, Mister<br>
    La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Understood, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Assemble an away team, Number One.<br>
    Include whatever medical<br>
    assistants the Doctor deems<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Excuse me sir, but I'd be more<br>
    useful dealing with the Mary<br>
    Rogers. There may be hundreds<br>
    who'll need attention --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Thank you Doctor, but I'll make<br>
    those decisions.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    You're going to Gravesworld.</p>
  <p>12 INT. TEN-FORWARD - ON DATA AND GUINAN</p>
  <p> talking, the bar between them. Data is in a daze...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot comprehend it. It is<br>
    beyond my ability to reason.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Don't feel too bad, Data. Humor<br>
    is subjective.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But this anecdote had all the<br>
    elements humans find so diverting!<br>
    A play on words, colorful<br>
    characters, deception, a lively<br>
    setting --</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (tongue in cheek)<br>
    -- Maybe it's the birds.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (cocking his head)<br>
    Interesting. How so?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Birds are considered to have<br>
    boring personalities. They just<br>
    sit around and eat seed all day.<br>
    Maybe squawk once in a while.<br>
    Boring.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data begins to consider this point seriously. Guinan<br>
    suppresses a smile as she continues...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    In fact, there's only one thing<br>
    birds do that's funny, but you<br>
    couldn't put that in a joke and<br>
    keep it tasteful.<br>
    (leans forward)<br>
    Now chickens. Chickens are funny.</p>
  <p> Data is surprised. He's about to ask her to elaborate,<br>
    when Riker steps up to the bar.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (cheerful)<br>
    Hello Guinan. Keeping this guy<br>
    out of trouble?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's a challenge, but I'm trying.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me sir, but in what way<br>
    is Guinan attempting to restrain<br>
    me from adversity?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Never mind, Data, I was only<br>
    joking.</p>
  <p> Data thinks, then suddenly explodes into a three second<br>
    burst of LAUGHTER. Once finished, he looks from Riker<br>
    to Guinan, uncertainty written on his face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That joke was funny. Was it not?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It wasn't meant to be, Data.</p>
  <p> Now Data's really confused.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Are you really going down to see<br>
    Ira Graves? The Ira Graves?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (intrigued smile)<br>
    How did you know about that?</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles slyly and ignores the question.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Remember Will -- great men have<br>
    great egos.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles back, wondering why this sounds like a<br>
    warning. He slaps Data on the shoulder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come on Data. A great man awaits.</p>
  <p> They nod good-bye to Guinan and head for the turbolift.<br>
    Riker takes a last look at:</p>
  <p>13 GUINAN</p>
  <p> still smiling a smile that says &quot;I know something you<br>
    don't know.&quot;</p>
  <p>14 INT. TURBOLIFT - RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> ride down together.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask a question, sir?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you just did.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (thinking it over)<br>
    Quite correct. May I ask you<br>
    another question after this one?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (chuckling)<br>
    Sure, what's on your mind?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you think it is pointless for<br>
    me to try and understand humor?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Pointless? Not necessarily.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe that comprehending what<br>
    is truly funny will bring me<br>
    closer to... humanness.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Until recently, I thought I was<br>
    making progress.</p>

  <p> exit the turbolift and head down the corridor toward<br>
    the transporter...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For example Commander, do you find<br>
    this amusing? There were<br>
    twelve....... aquatic fowl sitting<br>
    on a fence, and six had --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    -- Twelve. They only had a notion<br>
    to fly away.</p>
  <p> Data stops in his tracks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How did you --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    -- Are you kidding? That joke's<br>
    become a legend on this ship.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - WORF, PULASKI, TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and a MED-TECH are joined by Riker and Data (still<br>
    mulling over the status of his legendary anecdote).<br>
    Geordi is at the transporter controls. Riker wastes no<br>
    time in leading his team onto the platform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Phaser on stun, Mister Worf. We<br>
    don't know what's going on down<br>
    there; no need to take chances.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Agreed, sir.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Remember folks, this is a long<br>
    range transport. The effects will<br>
    be a little unusual.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How do you mean?</p>
  <p> Riker cuts in before Geordi can reply.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood. Energize.</p>
  <p> Pulaski turns to Riker just as they begin to<br>
    transport...</p>

  <p>17 INT. LIVING ROOM ON GRAVESWORLD - THE AWAY TEAM<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> begins to MATERIALIZE in comfortable if somewhat<br>
    cluttered living quarters. Behind them we can see the<br>
    planet through the window, including the multi-colored<br>
    rings that encircle her.</p>
  <p> It takes longer than usual for their materialization.<br>
    We hear the end of Pulaski's sentence as her body<br>
    becomes solid.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    -- ssstttaaaaaannnnddd!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You do now.</p>
  <p> All seem momentarily disoriented. Troi puts her hand<br>
    to her head.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ohh... I know this is crazy, but<br>
    for a moment I felt like I was<br>
    trapped inside that wall.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were. For a moment.</p>
  <p> Troi thinks that over. Behind her, Riker signals the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've arrived in Graves' home.<br>
    All's quiet so far -- on the other<br>
    hand, no one knew we were coming.</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Use caution and investigate.<br>
    Protect Graves' health at all<br>
    cost. We're leaving orbit to<br>
    assist the Mary Rogers. Back as<br>
    soon as possible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood, Captain. Riker out.</p>
  <p>18 ANGLE FAVORING DATA</p>
  <p> transfixed by something only he sees.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Let's look around -- see if<br>
    anybody's home.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Someone is home, sir.</p>
  <p>19 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> as the others turn to see what Data sees. Kareen<br>
    Brianon stands in the doorway, looking even more<br>
    ravishing than before.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    You heard me. Thank God.</p>
  <p> Kareen moves toward them and speaks in a halting, shy<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'<br>
    assistant. Are you... you with<br>
    Starfleet?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, we're from a ship called the<br>
    Enterprise. We monitored your<br>
    distress call but you never<br>
    acknowledged our response.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    I'm sorry, I... couldn't take the<br>
    chance...</p>
  <p> Riker moves forward and studies her eyes. Perhaps he's<br>
    somewhat smitten by her beauty.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What chance?</p>
  <p> GRAVES (O.S.)<br>
    (stern)<br>
    The chance that I might find out<br>
    someone was coming.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to see DOCTOR IRA GRAVES, standing behind<br>
    them in a corner of the room (a wall door sliding shut<br>
    behind him). He's a small man in his late seventies,<br>
    with intense, darting eyes, and a healthy wild-looking<br>
    shock of white hair. His skin is chalk-white, his<br>
    torso frail. We get the impression of strong mind,<br>
    weak body.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    Kareen knew full well that I would<br>
    not be pleased.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    I had no choice. I refuse to<br>
    stand by and watch you<br>
    deteriorate.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What symptoms have you noticed?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    He has pain, shortness of breath,<br>
    irritability --</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    -- Ridiculous! I'm as healthy<br>
    as a Rigellian ox!</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    We'll see about that, Ira.<br>
    (to away team)<br>
    I hope one of you is a doctor.</p>
  <p> Pulaski steps forward.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Call<br>
    me Kate.</p>
  <p> Pulaski greets Kareen and turns to do so with Ira. He<br>
    shudders and holds up his hands as she approaches.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    No offense, but I don't want you<br>
    touching me in a medical way.<br>
    It's no secret that I don't like<br>
    people much, and I like doctors<br>
    even less than people!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Funny, I always thought doctors<br>
    were people.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    And you were wrong. Just ask any<br>
    patient.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Although I will admit for a doctor<br>
    you're a nice looking woman.</p>
  <p> Graves is giving her body a slightly lecherous<br>
    appraisal. Pulaski looks at Riker and rolls her eyes.<br>
    Graves sets his sights on Troi...</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    And what have we here?... Another<br>
    lovely specimen of womanhood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought you didn't like people?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    I like women. Always try to<br>
    forget that they're people.</p>
  <p> Graves slides closer to Troi, never taking his eyes off<br>
    her cleavage.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (a bit embarrassed)<br>
    I'm Deanna Troi. It's an honor<br>
    to meet you Doctor Graves.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    Yes! Yes, of course it is! This<br>
    is one of the truly great moments<br>
    of your life! Believe me honey,<br>
    you'll never meet anyone half as<br>
    sagacious as me. I'm a phenom.</p>
  <p> Graves' bragging comes out in such an enthusiastic,<br>
    matter of fact way, one can't really be angry with him.<br>
    To him, his statements are simply facts; he is<br>
    incredibly brilliant. His egotism suits him. It's<br>
    perversely lovable, like the boastful old veteran<br>
    reminiscing about the men he killed in the war.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Oh there I go again -- shocking<br>
    people with the truth. I can<br>
    appreciate how hard it is for<br>
    others to try and keep up with<br>
    my mind. I don't mean to burden<br>
    with my brilliance. It just works<br>
    out that way.</p>
  <p> Over in a corner of the room, Kareen has been studying<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (soft, uncertain)<br>
    Excuse me sir... Are you a<br>
    Romulan?</p>
  <p> Worf's face twists into a scowl, as though he smells<br>
    something unpleasant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hardly.</p>
  <p>20 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    He's a Klingon, Kareen.<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Kareen has lived here since her<br>
    father died when she was quite<br>
    young. Her only knowledge of<br>
    inhuman races comes from me. I<br>
    suppose Klingons and Romulans must<br>
    look much alike.</p>
  <p> Worf snaps his head toward Riker, infuriated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (low growl)<br>
    Do I have to stand here and be<br>
    insulted?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    No insult intended, Mister Klingon.<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    See Doctor? Nothing wrong with<br>
    my hearing --</p>
  <p> At this moment Graves is overcome with a brief but<br>
    vicious wracking COUGH. It doubles him over<br>
    momentarily, but he quickly tries to pass it off by<br>
    honing in on Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>

    My, my, my...</p>
  <p> Graves stands right in front of Data, reaching up and<br>
    studying his face with ardent fascination.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Uh, Lieutenant Commander Data,<br>
    sir --</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    -- Shhh!</p>
  <p> Graves uses both hands to swivel Data's head from side<br>
    to side, as he examines the structure of the android's<br>
    ears, jawline, nose, etc. Behind Graves, Pulaski is<br>
    taking the opportunity to run a medical scanner up and<br>
    down the scientist's back. Unaware, Graves thinks out<br>
    loud as he continues to peruse Data...</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Functional... Durable... Obviously<br>
    no concern whatsoever for<br>
    aesthetic values.</p>
  <p> Data frowns -- now he's insulted. Graves releases his<br>
    head.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Looks like Soong's work.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Quite correct, sir! Did you know<br>
    Soong?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    Know him?!<br>
    (raspy cough)<br>
    I taught him everything he knows.<br>
    You could say I was the father<br>
    of his work...<br>
    (smiles as thought<br>
    occurs)<br>
    Which kinda makes me your<br>
    grandfather, doesn't it sonny?</p>
  <p> Graves spins as he becomes aware that Pulaski has been<br>
    scanning him. He scowls and backs away, but it's clear<br>
    she's found out enough already.</p>

  <p> GRAVES<br>

    Damn doctors! Always sneaking<br>
    up on you like that -- saying this<br>
    isn't going to hurt, this isn't<br>
    going to hurt, when you both know<br>
    it's going to hurt like hell!<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Well I'm not paying the bill for<br>
    this!</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    There won't be a bill, Doctor.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    May I speak with you privately?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    What for! Anything you think you<br>
    found's more my business than his!</p>
  <p> Riker thinks about it, then nods, giving Pulaski the<br>
    go-ahead to speak freely. She hesitates...</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Go on, gorgeous! Whatever the<br>
    hell it is, I can take it.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (uncomfortable)<br>
    I checked twice to make certain...<br>
    You have Varnay's disease.</p>
  <p> Kareen GASPS. Graves barely reacts.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>

    I'm sorry, Ira. You're dying,<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    You wanted to see me, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Yes Ensign. I assume you would<br>
    very much like to meet Doctor<br>
    Graves.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Yes sir. His theories on spatial<br>

    his work in thermodynamics is --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Good, I get the idea.<br>
    Providing his health is reasonably<br>
    intact, I'm going to appoint you<br>
    as his personal tour guide when<br>
    he comes aboard. You have the<br>
    run of the ship -- show him<br>
    anything you think he'll find<br>
    interesting, and for heaven's<br>

    Yes sir. Understood.<br>

    But why me, sir? I mean, not that<br>
    I'm complaining --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- Graves has a reputation for<br>
    being difficult and I'm not sure<br>
    I have the patience for that right<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> Picard turns from the window and looks Wesley in the<br>

    I have noticed Grandpa, that you<br>
    keep repeating the same notes of<br>
    a musical passage that I am<br>
    unfamiliar with.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    It's an ancient little tune called<br>
    &quot;If I Only Had A Heart.&quot; A rather<br>
    plaintive lament sung by a<br>
    mechanical man who longs to be<br>

    A happy ending. The mechanical<br>

  <p> Graves nods slowly.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    I feel pity for you. Your<br>
    existence is a kind of walking<br>
    purgatory -- neither dead nor<br>
    alive, never really feeling<br>
    anything. Just existing. Just<br>
    existing.</p>
  <p> Graves fights off A COUGHING SPELL. When he comes out<br>
    of it, there's a small, ironic smile on his face...</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    Listen to me -- a dying man taking<br>

    I'll be alone. I'll be without<br>
    Ira.</p>
  <p> Troi looks at her colleagues, uncertain of what to say.<br>
    Surprisingly, it is Worf who gently approaches the<br>
    girl.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (lowered tone)<br>
    I know what it is to lose those<br>
    closest to your heart. It will<br>
    be hard... you will feel alone<br>
    at first... but it will surely<br>
    pass, as time passes. I know.</p>
  <p> She looks up at Worf with tears in the corner of her<br>
    eyes. She instinctively knows that his words come from<br>
    a place deep within him. The little girl in her comes<br>
    forward and she embraces Worf, GENTLY SOBBING on his<br>
    chest. The Klingon is caught off guard, initially<br>
    uncomfortable with the situation. Slowly, awkwardly,<br>
    he puts a protective arm around her, looking up at the<br>
    others to make sure they're not laughing at him.</p>
  <p>26 INT. GRAVES' LABORATORY - GRAVES</p>
  <p> is still intently working at the computer terminal.<br>
    Data is beside him, obviously pondering their<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You mentioned your impending death<br>
    a while ago. I must say Grandpa,<br>
    that you are facing it with<br>
    remarkable courage and stoicism.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    That is because I am an incredible<br>
    man, possessing an iron will and<br>
    nerves of steel. Two traits that<br>
    helped me become the genius I am<br>
    today as well as the lady-killer<br>
    I was in days gone by.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    You condone homicide, sir?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    It's an expression, Data. It<br>
    means I was once as beautiful as<br>
    I am smart.</p>
  <p> Data looks at the grizzled old man before him with<br>
    amazement.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Really Grandpa?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    No, not really -- but what the<br>
    hell, I'm dying. I can remember<br>
    my life any way I want.</p>
  <p> Graves fights off A COUGH and smiles at &quot;his grandson.&quot;</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I'll tell you a little secret,<br>
    Sonny. I don't think I truly will<br>
    be dying.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But... the doctor --</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    -- Oh I'll die, but I won't really<br>
    be dead. You see?</p>
  <p> Graves motions for Data to take a closer look at his<br>
    revolutionary computer terminal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've invented a way of<br>
    transferring consciousness into<br>
    a computer. Before I die I plan<br>
    to convey my great intelligence<br>
    into this machine, thus cheating<br>
    the Grim Reaper of his greatest<br>
    prize.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Grim Reaper... Is that a farmer<br>
    with no sense of humor?</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    I speak of the personification<br>
    of death itself.<br>
    (coughs)<br>
    But what do you know of death?<br>
    It is a subject forever alien to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Well Grandpa, that is not<br>
    necessarily true. I do have an<br>
    &quot;off button&quot; if you like. Its<br>
    activation robs me of all<br>
    consciousness -- therefore<br>
    rendering me dead for all intents<br>
    and purposes.</p>
  <p> Data walks over to study an equation on a chart on the<br>
    wall. He does not see the thoughtful expression on<br>
    Graves' face...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It is not something I enjoy<br>
    contemplating.</p>
  <p> GRAVES<br>
    I can understand that; still the<br>
    analogy is a good one.<br>
    (pause, nonchalant)<br>
    Just where would Soong position<br>
    such a device? Don't tell me,<br>
    let me guess.</p>

    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> are awaiting the Enterprise's return. Kareen has<br>
    stopped crying, she sits next to Worf on the couch.<br>
    Worf rises as a figure begins to MATERIALIZE in the<br>
    room. It is Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Riker goes to him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome to Gravesworld, sir. This<br>
    is Kareen Brianon, Doctor Graves'<br>
    friend and assistant.</p>
  <p> Picard appraises the beautiful, sad-eyed girl who<br>
    stands to greet him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm very sorry, Ms. Brianon. I'm<br>
    sure this is quite difficult for<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Thank you, Captain. Your people<br>
    have been most kind to me.</p>
  <p> Picard nods compassionately and turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where's Data?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's been with Doctor Graves<br>
    almost the entire time. They seem<br>
    to have developed a genuine<br>
    rapport.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hmm, I suppose I can understand<br>
    that.<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    I think we should immediately<br>
    transport to the ship. There are<br>
    patients from the Rogers who<br>
    could use some of your medical<br>
    savvy.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Injuries?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Nothing serious.<br>
    (to Kareen)<br>
    But I'd also like to get Doctor<br>
    Graves to a place where we can<br>
    make him more comfortable.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    That will not be necessary,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p>28 MOVE IN ON DATA</p>
  <p> BACKLIT in the doorway. For a moment he just stands<br>
    there, perusing the room, taking things in slowly.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Explain yourself, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It happened in my arms, just a<br>
    few moments ago.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    There is no need to hurry... Ira<br>
    Graves is dead.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>29 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> pulling out of orbit, leaving Gravesworld behind.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Supplemental. I<br>
    leave Gravesworld with an empty<br>
    feeling and the knowledge that<br>
    our mission was unsuccessful.<br>
    Whatever scientific secrets Ira<br>
    Graves was about to unlock will<br>
    follow him to his grave...</p>
  <p>30 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - KAREEN BRIANON (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> sadly watches the planet shrink in size as the<br>
    Enterprise heads out into space...</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our immediate priority is to reach<br>
    the nearest starbase so that<br>
    Graves' assistant and the marooned<br>
    settlers can get on with their<br>
    lives.</p>
  <p>31 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD</p>
  <p> Riker and Pulaski, stand across from Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And he really believed he could<br>
    transfer his intellect into a<br>
    computer?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct. Unfortunately<br>
    he never had the opportunity to<br>
    elaborate. Death came swiftly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why didn't you notify Doctor<br>
    Pulaski when it started to happen?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To do so would have been<br>
    pointless. There was nothing she<br>
    could have done.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is vaguely disturbed by Data's attitude.<br>
    Surprisingly, Pulaski supports the android's words...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's probably right. My<br>
    preliminary report indicates an<br>
    extremely rapid heart stoppage.<br>
    Death was almost instantaneous.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am not an &quot;it,&quot; Doctor. You<br>
    have been duly informed of this<br>
    on several occasions, yet you<br>
    continue to label me with that<br>
    abhorrent pronoun.</p>
  <p> Before Pulaski can apologize, Picard addresses Data...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data... I realize you liked Doctor<br>
    Graves a great deal.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He was the greatest man I have<br>
    ever known.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does his death disturb you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Disturb, Captain? No. All things<br>
    must pass.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    May I go now, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes of course.</p>
  <p> Data turns to exit the room, but pauses at the doorway,<br>
    his back to the others...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We will try and do the funeral<br>
    the way he wanted, will we not,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I told you we would, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am glad, sir. It was his dying<br>
    wish.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Riker strokes his chin thoughtfully...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's interesting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hmm?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I thought he said death came<br>
    swiftly. When did Graves have<br>
    time to make a dying wish?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Perhaps beforehand. Perhaps he<br>
    had a premonition.</p>
  <p>32 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - KAREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> still stands alone, despondently gazing at the stars.<br>
    She turns as Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (gently, feminine)<br>
    Hello Data. It's good to see you<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> He stops at the far end of the room and stares at her<br>
    for a moment before slowly making his way toward her.<br>
    She turns back to the stars as he comes up beside<br>
    her...</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The stars are so beautiful when<br>
    seen from space. Yet they seem<br>
    lonely -- each so isolated from<br>
    the next.</p>
  <p> She turns when she realizes Data is staring at her<br>
    profile.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ira... never told you how<br>
    beautiful you were to him. He<br>
    never told you that, did he?</p>
  <p> Her lips part slightly in surprise.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He could not tell you, do you<br>
    understand?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Yes. I understand.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But he wanted to. Every waking<br>
    moment.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    And he wanted you to know that.</p>
  <p> Kareen is mesmerized. Data is staring deep into her<br>
    eyes with a great depth of feeling. Then, abruptly, he<br>
    swivels and walks toward the door...</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Data!<br>
    (pause)<br>
    How do you know? How do you<br>
    know... what he thought of me?</p>
  <p> Data stops where he is and seems to search his memory<br>
    before answering. The reply comes with a shrug...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He told me.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p>33 MOVE IN ON KAREEN</p>
  <p> unnerved by his visit.</p>

    catch him from behind.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard stops and waits for him to catch up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (a bit hesitant)<br>
    I heard about the ceremony you're<br>
    having for Doctor Graves, and...<br>
    well sir --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- You wish to attend.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Since I never got to meet him...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it's a fine idea. Come<br>
    along, Wes.</p>
  <p>36 INT. ENTRANCE TO HOLODECK - ON DATA</p>
  <p> who is addressing the Holodeck computer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... The temperature should be<br>
    seventy-two, no make it<br>
    seventy-one degrees. And whenever<br>
    the name Ira Graves is mentioned<br>
    it will warm considerably --</p>
  <p> Data cuts off as Picard and Wesley approach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are we the first?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are the last. The others have<br>
    congregated inside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good.<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> The Holodeck doors slide open and REVEAL the scene<br>
    inside. We can see Kareen as well as all the members<br>
    of the away team, gathered on a grassy plain.</p>
  <p> As Wesley starts to step through, Data grasps his arm.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Perhaps the child would be better<br>
    off playing somewhere else. This<br>
    is an adult ceremony after all.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    The child? You still working on<br>
    your sense of humor, Data?</p>
  <p> Wesley slithers free and enters the Holodeck. Picard<br>
    frowns at Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't seem yourself lately.<br>
    Are you feeling all right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course, sir. I am as healthy<br>
    as a Rigellian ox.</p>
  <p>37 INT. HOLODECK - CLOSE ON THE FACE OF IRA GRAVES</p>
  <p> resting peacefully in a clear glass-like casket.</p>
  <p>38 PULL BACK TO SEE THE LITTLE CONGREGATION</p>
  <p> gathered in a respectful half-circle around him. Troi<br>
    is speaking in a soft, peaceful tone...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... Although we hardly knew him,<br>
    we certainly knew of him. His<br>
    reputation spread throughout the<br>
    galaxy, and his mind touched all<br>
    who cherish science.</p>
  <p>39 ANGLE ON KAREEN</p>
  <p> gaunt, sad, gazing at the casket. Slowly, she looks<br>
    over at:</p>
  <p>40 DATA</p>
  <p> who seems to be enjoying this. Unnoticed by the<br>
    others, he is looking around, his head bobbing happily,<br>
    a thin smile on his lips.</p>
  <p> TROI (O.S.)<br>
    We gather here today, to say a<br>
    respectful good-bye to Ira<br>
    Ellsworth Graves. A man who --</p>
  <p> Data interrupts by walking in front of Troi to where<br>
    Picard and Riker stand side by side.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is not exactly what he<br>
    wanted.</p>
  <p> Riker is annoyed. He indicates the surroundings (some<br>
    of which are implied as being OFF CAMERA).</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You programmed the setting. The<br>
    field, the mountain range --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- It is not the environment that<br>
    I question, Commander. This was<br>
    one of his favorite places on<br>
    Gravesworld.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well what is it then?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the tone, the pacing, the<br>
    content of the verbal tribute.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    No offense Counselor, but Doctor<br>
    Graves would have desired a<br>
    slightly more personal address.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And how can you be so sure?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why he told me, of course.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Perhaps I should take over, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard SIGHS. At last he gives a slight nod.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you promise to be brief. When<br>
    I agreed to this, I didn't intend<br>
    for it to interfere with our<br>
    duties. Understood?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perfectly.</p>
  <p> Data moves before the casket and looks pridefully at<br>
    the old, pale, shriveled face inside. He speaks in a<br>
    trembling voice, with tremendous pride.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just look at that face. The face<br>
    of a thinker, a warrior, a man<br>
    for all seasons.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>41 ANGLE ON WESLEY AND WORF</p>
  <p> each squinting to get a better look at Graves. A<br>
    warrior?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes friends, Ira Graves was all<br>
    that and more.</p>
  <p>42 REACTION SHOT OF THE OTHERS</p>
  <p> at the sound of &quot;Ira Graves,&quot; the temperature rises ten<br>
    degrees and the GROUND RUMBLES for a few moments.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ira Graves was a great<br>
    humanitarian.</p>
  <p> Again the temperature goes up and the GROUND SHAKES AND<br>
    ROARS. People are beginning to perspire...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    To know know know him, was to love<br>
    love love him. But Ira Graves<br>
    was not perfect.</p>
  <p> The same response, stronger now, at the sound of his<br>
    name. The GROUND SHAKES so hard they're almost knocked<br>
    off their feet. An angry Picard wipes a layer of sweat<br>
    off his brow...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing, unaware)<br>
    Perhaps his greatest fault was<br>
    that he was too selfless. Cared<br>
    too much for his fellow man.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data! That's enough!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am almost finished sir.</p>

  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's become of your judgment?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I am maturing, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you consider it mature to<br>
    program the mountains to tremble<br>
    every time you say the name, Ira<br>
    Graves?</p>
  <p> Data sheepishly looks down at the ground.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Not to mention the air warming<br>
    at the very thought of him. We<br>
    would've been barbequed if we'd<br>
    stayed much longer.</p>
  <p> Data is even more ashamed -- suddenly incredibly down<br>
    on himself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I seem to have overdone it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To put it mildly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I brought shame to this ship.<br>
    To the good name of Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    his wishes. To make sure I kept<br>
    my promise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know that Data.</p>
  <p> Picard is concerned by Data's sudden melancholy. He<br>
    somewhat awkwardly puts a hand on the android's<br>

    Look... I realize you've been<br>
    studying the human equation with<br>
    great alacrity, but maybe you've<br>
    been trying just a little too<br>
    hard. Do you know what I mean?</p>
  <p> A somber, doe-eyed Data nods his head. Picard<br>
    continues, actually feeling a bit guilty...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Try and relax a little. Don't<br>
    try to be so... &quot;human.&quot; Just<br>
    be yourself. Okay?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (serious, just a touch<br>
    of sadness)<br>
    Affirmative, sir. I will work<br>
    on staying within myself. Now<br>
    if you will excuse me, I am due<br>
    on the bridge.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Data begins to exit. Picard looks at<br>

    toward us. His somber expression is abruptly replaced<br>
    by a pleased, self-confident one. A remarkably sudden<br>
    transition.</p>
  <p> He turns to check out an attractive CREWWOMAN as she<br>
    passes him. When he turns around again he begins to<br>
    WHISTLE as he walks. The tune is familiar: &quot;IF I ONLY<br>
    HAD A HEART.&quot;</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>45 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - TRACKING PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> walking briskly down the corridor.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm concerned, sir. I've never<br>
    seen him act like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Could it be that grandfather<br>
    analogy Graves planted in his<br>
    head?. Data is an orphan in a<br>
    manner of speaking. Maybe the<br>
    loss of Graves really got to him.<br>
    Touched him emotionally.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope that's all it is.</p>
  <p> They stop at a door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's Captain Picard and Commander<br>
    Riker. May we come in?</p>
  <p>46 INT. KAREEN'S QUARTERS - PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> ENTER. Kareen sits in a form-fitting leather chair,<br>
    looking very beautiful and very sad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've come to pay our respects,<br>
    Miss Brianon.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Thank you, gentlemen. That's most<br>
    thoughtful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're due at Starbase Six in less<br>
    than twelve hours. We thought<br>
    you might enjoy a quick look at<br>
    the bridge before we arrive.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Can one see the stars from up<br>
    there?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh yes. Closer than you've ever<br>
    seen them before.</p>
  <p> This thought brings the flicker of a smile to her<br>
    lovely face. She stands up gracefully...</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    I think I'd enjoy that very much.</p>
  <p> Each man takes a hand and escorts her out of the room.</p>
  <p>47 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> cruising toward Starbase Six.</p>
  <p>48 INT. BRIDGE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data at Ops, Wesley at Conn, Geordi in Command with<br>
    Troi beside him, Worf at Tactical.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (grinning)<br>
    That was a great speech, Data.<br>
    To know know him is to love love<br>
    love love love him?!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (dry)<br>
    Taken from a centuries-old Earth<br>
    composition. Your child-like mind<br>
    cannot appreciate the timeworn<br>
    wisdom of its words.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (teasing)<br>
    You're not turning into a<br>
    star-crossed artist on us, are<br>
    you Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am many things: artist,<br>
    scholar, lover, genius --</p>
  <p> He cuts off, offended at the LAUGHTER of Geordi and<br>
    Wesley. The two of them think his stoic delivery is<br>
    hilarious.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're getting funnier, I gotta<br>
    hand it to you.<br>
    (laughs, shakes head)<br>
    There's something to be said for<br>
    that deadpan delivery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>49 ANGLE ON THE TURBOLIFT DOOR</p>
  <p> as Picard and Riker ENTER, escorting Kareen. Still<br>
    chuckling, Geordi EXITS the bridge, relinquishing the<br>
    Command Area.</p>
  <p>50 CLOSE ON DATA</p>
  <p> frowning as he sees Kareen with the two officers.</p>
  <p>51 WIDE ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Kareen is enraptured by the bridge, especially the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're looking in the general<br>
    direction of the constellation<br>
    Pegasus.</p>
  <p> Kareen's eyes are aglow. She truly loves stargazing.<br>
    No one notices that Data is watching them with a<br>
    distinct glower.</p>
  <p> Picard gently touches her shoulder, leading her toward<br>
    the Aft Stations.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm aware of your interest in<br>
    science. Perhaps you'd like to<br>
    --</p>
  <p> Data interrupts with a sullen growl, spinning to face<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (under his breath)<br>
    -- And I am aware of your interest<br>
    in her.</p>
  <p> That said, he quickly faces forward again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sharply)<br>
    What was that, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing sir. Nothing at all.</p>
  <p> Picard is about to say something else, then thinks<br>
    better of it. He turns his attention back to the young<br>
    lady...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These are our science stations.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>52 TWO SHOT OF DATA AND WESLEY</p>
  <p> at their stations. The boy is wide-eyed, having heard<br>
    Data's comment. Data continues to simmer...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (whisper)<br>
    What's wrong with you?!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (normal voice)<br>
    I detest hypocrisy. I wish they<br>
    would just come out and admit it.</p>
  <p>53 WIDE ANGLE FAVORING PICARD</p>
  <p> who is not about to let that comment pass by.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (angry)<br>
    Admit what, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> Data calmly turns and addresses Riker and Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That your interest in Kareen is<br>
    not entirely honorable.</p>
  <p> Everyone is shocked.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Data! You are way out of line!</p>
  <p> Data ignores Worf and deliberately walks toward Picard<br>
    and Riker...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Try as you might, you cannot win<br>
    her heart. She does not like<br>
    older men...<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    ... or men of limited intellect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (controlling his temper)<br>
    Mister Data, you are hereby relieved<br>
    of duty -- Worf, take his station.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> Worf moves to Ops. Picard continues with Data...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You will report to your quarters<br>
    immediately. You will not leave<br>
    there until you hear otherwise<br>
    from me. Is that understood?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sure, I understand.<br>
    (looks at Kareen)<br>
    I understand all too well.</p>
  <p> Everyone's a bit spellbound as Data reaches out and<br>
    gently touches Kareen's cheek before retiring to the<br>
    turbolift. The doors open and he enters...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Removing the competition will not<br>
    help you, Picard.</p>
  <p> And the doors shut. No one knows what to say -- all<br>
    are stunned. Kareen seems shaky and frightened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Kareen)<br>
    Do you know what that was all<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> Still disturbed, she shakes her head vigorously.<br>
    Beside her, Troi is mulling something over...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (as a revelation)<br>
    Jealousy... I sensed intense,<br>
    burning jealousy. And it was<br>
    coming from Data!</p>
  <p>54 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - DATA</p>
  <p> is standing before a full-length mirror,<br>
    narcissistically studying his own image. He turns<br>
    sideways and goes up on his toes, shamelessly admiring<br>
    his body.</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS in a concerned state.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I heard what happened but I just<br>
    can't believe it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Do not trouble yourself, friend.<br>
    I am sure the captain will be by<br>
    to apologize shortly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You expect him to apologize?</p>
  <p> Data doesn't even answer -- he's too enthralled with<br>
    his own image in the glass.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It seems I was too harsh on Soong.<br>
    Notice the strong chin, the finely<br>
    chiseled features, the powerful<br>
    torso. Do you realize that this<br>
    body will never wear out.<br>
    (sighs with pleasure)<br>
    Immortality.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What the hell are you talking<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, still angry.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing; to Picard)<br>
    He's not himself, sir. I know<br>
    him better than anybody.</p>
  <p> Picard's face twists into a grimace as he notices<br>
    Data's shameless preening before the mirror.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    We're going to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (aloof)<br>
    Oh? Are you ill, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm getting there. Come along.</p>
  <p>55 INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON PULASKI</p>
  <p> looking displeased.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't oil machinery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>56 PULL BACK TO SEE</p>
  <p> Pulaski standing across from Picard, with Data sitting<br>
    up on a bed behind them.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Why don't you take it down to<br>
    Engineering?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because I brought him to you.<br>
    I want a complete medical check<br>
    run on him immediately.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    I'll do the best I can --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- I expect nothing less.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    -- But if it blew a fuse or<br>
    something I may not pick it up.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have the utmost faith in your<br>
    abilities, Doctor. I know nothing<br>
    will get by you.</p>
  <p> Behind them, Data has been smiling -- amused at their<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>57 CLOSE-UP OF MEDICAL MONITOR</p>
  <p> graphs rising and falling.</p>
  <p>58 PULL BACK TO SEE</p>
  <p> Data lying on a medical bed with Pulaski hovering over<br>
    him, running instruments along his body. Data takes<br>
    the time to leer at her body. Pulaski comments dryly<br>
    without taking her eyes off her instruments...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm sure there's a reason you're<br>
    looking at me that way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am simply looking. Any thought<br>
    of ulterior motive rests with you.<br>
    Perhaps you are projecting your<br>
    own desires.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (derisive chuckle)<br>
    Perhaps not. I've had three<br>
    husbands dear, and they've all<br>
    been flesh and blood. For some<br>
    strange reason I like it that way.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Now shut up and turn over.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Very well. It is your loss.</p>
  <p>59 INT. ADJOINING ROOM IN SICKBAY - DATA</p>
  <p> WALKS IN as Picard, Pulaski and Troi prepare to discuss<br>
    the results.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wait for me in the corridor, Mister<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What for? This concerns me more<br>
    than it does any of you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (raising voice)<br>
    You will wait for me in the<br>
    corridor!</p>
  <p> Data SIGHS and reluctantly EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    His insubordination is growing<br>
    by leaps and bounds. I could<br>
    throw him in the brig but I'd<br>
    rather try and help him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Well I really don't know what to<br>
    suggest. Physically it's fit as<br>
    a fiddle. Granted it's not easy<br>
    to examine a tin can the size of<br>
    a human, but I'll be damned if<br>
    I can find anything wrong with<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Picard begins to pace -- he's frustrated and concerned.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Perhaps we're looking in the wrong<br>
    place, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well, Data's physical health may<br>
    be unimpaired but it's his mental<br>
    health that needs to be addressed.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Are you suggesting it's losing<br>
    its mind?</p>
  <p> Troi thinks before answering...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    With your permission Captain,<br>
    there's one way to find out.</p>
  <p>60 INT. DATA'S QUARTERS - TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> finishes attaching a thin wire to Data's wrist. We can<br>
    see identical wires running from his chest and head to<br>
    a small black box. Data is sitting before a<br>
    viewscreen, looking displeased...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You remember the psychotronic<br>
    stability examination, don't you<br>
    Data? We all had to take it<br>
    before graduating from the<br>
    Academy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was a waste of time then and<br>
    it is a waste of time now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Just watch the screen and let your<br>
    mind go blank. This little<br>
    machine will do the rest.</p>
  <p> Reluctantly, Data looks up at the screen.</p>
  <p>61 ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> a series of images begin to appear:</p>
  <p> A green meadow... a waterfall... fire... the Earth seen<br>
    from space... the Enterprise... a man and woman<br>
    embracing... a baby ... the color yellow... the<br>
    Federation seal...</p>
  <p>62 CLOSE ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> the images reflecting off his face.</p>
  <p>63 BACK TO VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> images flying by faster now, dissolving into one<br>
    another:</p>
  <p> The blackness of space... an old woman... the color<br>
    red... Picard... an alien landscape... Geordi... a<br>
    Klingon battle cruiser... Remmick... the word<br>
    &quot;honor&quot;... the number 2... a barren orchard... a purple<br>
    sunset...</p>
  <p>64 DATA</p>
  <p> squirms in his seat; this is making him uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>65 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD AND GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> are conferring.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's safe to say you're his best<br>
    friend. Can you speculate on<br>
    what's happening to him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's just a guess sir, but, well<br>
    sometimes he wants to be human<br>
    so bad he can taste it. And<br>
    sometimes he is more human than<br>
    he or we realize.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think your theory might be<br>
    right, Captain. Witnessing<br>
    Graves' death may have been the<br>
    catalyst --</p>
  <p> Geordi cuts off as Troi appears on the VIEWSCREEN.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have the results of the tests,<br>
    Captain. I -- I ran two tests<br>
    to make certain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make certain of what?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    There are two distinct<br>
    personalities within Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?! He's an android, that's<br>
    not possible!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Nevertheless it is true. The<br>
    second personality is the<br>
    dominant. It is unbalanced:<br>
    brilliant but vain, sensitive yet<br>
    paranoid. I believe it is also<br>
    capable of extreme acts of<br>
    violence.</p>
  <p>66 ANGLE ON PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as his mind reaches a stunning realization...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shocked whisper)<br>
    So that's it...</p>

  <p>66 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What was that, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lost in thought)<br>
    Nothing. Go on.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It seems to have an especially<br>
    strong hatred of you, Captain.<br>
    Or to a lesser degree, any<br>
    authority figure.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    And worst of all, it's growing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do you mean?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The alien persona is getting<br>
    stronger -- gobbling up what's<br>
    left of the original Data.</p>
  <p>67 MOVE IN ON TROI'S IMAGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If we don't find a way to stop<br>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>68 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - PICARD AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> are deeply concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is he now, Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I left him in his quarters. He<br>
    still has orders not to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Orders? Which personality will<br>
    choose to obey my orders?</p>
  <p> Picard quickly addresses the wall-panel computer,<br>
    sensing trouble.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Tell me -- where is Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Data?</p>
  <p>69 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - KAREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is back at her favorite spot, eyeing the starry sky,<br>
    her back to the door. She does not see Data as he<br>
    quietly ENTERS the room. He just stands there...<br>
    staring at her back. His unseen presence has an<br>
    ominous quality to it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Hello Kareen.</p>
  <p> She turns, startled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You know who I am, don't you?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    You're -- you're Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You know who I am. Don't you.</p>
  <p> Data moves forward until they're face to face. He is<br>
    commanding, intense; she is nervous, more than a little<br>
    frightened. Still, there's a trace of hope in her<br>
    eyes.</p>

    It is me, Kareen! I'm here -- I'm<br>
    alive!</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    How?</p>

    body...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just look at me! Sleek, powerful,<br>
    indestructable.</p>
  <p> He grabs an object off the table. His face grows grim<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When I was a boy, other children<br>

    physically. They teased me -- bullied<br>
    me. That's when I<br>
    withdrew... Became an island.</p>

    new ability.</p>
  <p> He turns his head as the door opens and Worf ENTERS<br>
    with TWO SECURITY GUARDS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excuse me Data, but the captain<br>
    would like to see you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.<br>
    (to Kareen)<br>
    If you will excuse me, Miss<br>
    Brianon.</p>
  <p> Data begins to go with the three of them. Just as Worf<br>
    turns his back, Data savagely fells him with a<br>
    two-fisted blow to the back of the head. He grabs a<br>
    phaser from the unconscious Klingon and points it at<br>
    the security guards.</p>
  <p> One of the guards goes for his phaser -- Data fires<br>
    right into his chest, taking him out. The other guard<br>
    makes no such move.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You're just the type, aren't you?<br>
    You'd beat me up if you could,<br>
    but you can't. Not any more.</p>
  <p> The guard is bewildered; he looks at Kareen<br>
    questioningly.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Ira, no.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Stay out of it!<br>
    (to Guard)<br>
    You're lucky I'm such a<br>
    compassionate man. Now walk!</p>
  <p> The guard tentatively turns and walks toward the door.<br>
    Data grins and ruthlessly shoots him in the back,<br>
    knocking him out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Three bodies now clutter the floor and Data is<br>
    delighted. He moves to Kareen -- she takes a step back<br>
    and looks at him with alarm in her eyes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There's something I must do -- something<br>
    they're forcing me to<br>
    do. I'll come for you when my<br>
    task is complete.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (voice trembling)<br>
    Ira... I don't understand...<br>
    what's happening to you?</p>
  <p> He takes her hand in his. She doesn't resist.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Something wonderful. I feel no<br>
    pain, no pain at all! And I'm<br>
    immortal -- I'll never have to<br>
    face death again. Think of the<br>
    things I'll accomplish over the<br>
    next thousand years!</p>
  <p> Kareen is horrified. Data sees her reaction but<br>
    misreads it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know what you're thinking, but<br>
    there's no need to worry. I'll<br>
    create an android body for you<br>
    as well. We'll witness the end<br>
    of infinity together.</p>
  <p> She begins to cry. Her tears have a curious effect on<br>
    him; he loses some of his fiery bravado and becomes<br>
    softer and more sensitive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't cry, Kareen.<br>
    (pause, concerned)<br>
    Don't you see, I can love you now.<br>
    The way I've always wanted to.<br>
    It wouldn't have been right<br>
    then... I was too old for you,<br>
    too weak. But now I can be<br>
    everything you've ever wanted.</p>
  <p> She grimaces and tries to pull away.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>69 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Ira -- you're hurting me!</p>
  <p> He's shocked to find he's unconsciously squeezing her<br>
    hand. He lets go, realizing he could have broken it<br>
    into a hundred pieces. Kareen cradles her wounded hand<br>
    -- Data stares at his own hand in dull horror. His<br>
    action seems to have taken the wind out of his sails.<br>
    He leans over and gently wipes a tear from her cheek.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (softly, dazed)<br>
    I'll be back. Wait for me.</p>
  <p> As he exits, he looks at the three downed men with a<br>
    touch of alarm. Did I really do that? He carefully<br>
    steps around them, takes one last look at Kareen, and<br>
    EXITS.</p>
  <p> Kareen goes to Worf, who is GROANING, just beginning to<br>
    revive.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ohhh, what hit me?</p>
  <p> The doors open and Riker and Picard ENTER, rushing to<br>
    Kareen and Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did Data do this?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    But it's not really Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I realize that now.</p>
  <p> Picard addresses the com panel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (into com)<br>
    Security alert -- all decks.<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data may be armed and<br>
    dangerous. Use extreme caution<br>
    and subdue. All phasers on stun.</p>
  <p>70 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - GEORDI AT COMMAND</p>
  <p> Troi beside him, Wesley at Conn, the rest are N.D.<br>
    CREWMEMBERS. The turbolift doors open and Data steps<br>
    out brandishing a phaser.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Well hello there. You all look<br>
    like you could use a little<br>
    vacation.</p>
  <p>71 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PULASKI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> has arrived and is treating and reviving the security<br>
    guards. Picard and Riker are helping Worf to his feet<br>
    when the viewscreen activates. We see Data holding a<br>
    phaser to Geordi's head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain Picard -- I have ordered<br>
    your people to vacate the bridge<br>
    and they have refused. In an<br>
    effort to save insignificant lives<br>
    I will give you the opportunity<br>
    to issue the same order.<br>
    Otherwise, I will remove them my<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (softly, to Picard)<br>
    That phaser's set to kill,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data. That's your best friend<br>
    you're threatening. That's<br>
    Geordi. You wouldn't harm him<br>
    for the world, would you?</p>
  <p> Data looks at Geordi and begins to soften. It becomes<br>
    clear that there is a struggle going on inside him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (uncertain)<br>
    Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes Data. It's me.</p>
  <p> For a moment it looks like Data is about to release<br>
    him. Then something kicks in and he violently presses<br>
    the phaser against Geordi's head again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He's no friend of mine! I should<br>
    kill him on the spot -- put him<br>
    out of his blind misery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You win -- no need to act rashly.<br>
    Mister La Forge, you and the rest<br>
    of the bridge crew will vacate<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I'll blast anyone who attempts<br>
    to reenter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You will make no attempt to<br>
    recapture the bridge. Is that<br>
    clear, Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes sir. Evacuating now.</p>
  <p> Data seems to think about it before letting Geordi move<br>
    OFF SCREEN. Suddenly there's an evil glint in his eye.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Maybe I should shoot one in the<br>
    back just to let you know I mean<br>
    business.</p>
  <p> There's a horrible, helpless moment of silence as<br>
    Picard and company watch Data take aim on someone about<br>
    to exit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it you want? Tell me!</p>
  <p> Data grins and deliberately begins to squeeze the<br>
    trigger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Kareen is with us! You want to<br>
    talk to Kareen.</p>
  <p> Slowly Data lowers the gun and turns to face Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Kareen? Are you there?</p>
  <p> Picard motions with his head for Kareen to approach the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Yes -- yes Ira. I'm here.</p>
  <p> Once again Data goes through a radical mood change. He<br>
    becomes somber, paranoid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They're all against me, Kareen.<br>
    They want to drive me out of this<br>
    body. To kill me!</p>
  <p> Kareen looks to Picard and Riker, uncertain of how to<br>
    react.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're going to a new world, my<br>
    darling. A place where no one<br>
    can ever touch us. Just hang on,<br>
    and trust in me.</p>
  <p> The viewscreen goes dead. Riker tries to reactivate<br>
    it...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to bridge, Riker to bridge.<br>
    (pause, to Picard)<br>
    It's no good. He deactivated the<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> Picard grimly looks at the frightened girl, trying to<br>
    figure a way to recapture the bridge.</p>
  <p>72 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - LATER - PICARD</p>
  <p> has convened an emergency meeting. Troi, Wesley,<br>
    Geordi, Worf, Riker, Pulaski, and Kareen attending.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We must remember that we're<br>
    dealing with an unhealthy mind,<br>
    ravaged by Varnay's disease as<br>
    well as the strain of assimilating<br>
    into a new body.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And that &quot;unhealthy mind&quot; is in<br>
    total control of this ship.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yet he seems to have a purpose.<br>
    He said something about going to<br>
    a new world.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Kareen)<br>
    Do you know what he meant by that?</p>
  <p> She shakes her head.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Kareen)<br>
    Is there anything you can tell<br>
    us about Ira Graves that will help<br>
    us to understand?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (distraught)<br>
    He's a wonderful man. He's not<br>
    like this --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- He's taken over my ship! And<br>
    I want her back!<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Are you going to help me?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    How can I help?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    By rejecting him! By deflating<br>
    his ego.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, he said he was doing this<br>
    for you. Saying you want nothing<br>
    to do with him might distract him<br>
    long enough --</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    -- I won't hurt him! He's sick,<br>
    I won't help to destroy him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It might be our only hope! He<br>
    controls all life-support systems<br>
    on this ship. He could start<br>
    killing us like flies.</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    (yelling, distraught)<br>
    I can't do it, don't you<br>
    understand?</p>
  <p> Picard leans back in his chair. He slowly nods his<br>
    head...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I suppose I do understand.</p>
  <p> The captain rises.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>72 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where are you going, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (grim, determined)<br>
    To the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can't let you do that, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have no choice, Number One.<br>
    Should I fail to return I want<br>
    you to attempt an external bridge<br>
    separation. Get all of our people<br>
    as far away from him as possible.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You can't just walk in on him!<br>
    He won't hesitate to kill you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's still some of Data inside.<br>
    I know there is. If I can reach<br>
    him, maybe we've still got a<br>
    chance.</p>
  <p>73 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> sits at Command, watching the viewscreen, phaser in<br>
    hand. He spins as the turbolift doors open, and fires<br>
    a shot that barely misses Picard's head.</p>
  <p> The captain stands there calmly, then slowly walks onto<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I could've killed you. You know<br>
    that, don't you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do know that. I also know you<br>
    haven't killed anyone so far.<br>
    I don't think you really want to.</p>
  <p> Data doesn't say anything; he simply watches the<br>
    captain through narrowed eyes. Picard indicates the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Where are we going?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schizoid Man&quot; - 10/10/88 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>73 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To the Aldebaran system. There's<br>
    a planet there that suits my<br>
    purpose.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which is?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why should I tell you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because you're lonely. Because<br>
    you want someone else to share<br>
    your plans.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I'll tell you... because I'm<br>
    bored. I plan on building a<br>
    fortress, with a laboratory of<br>
    course. Those of your crew that<br>
    I do not exterminate shall live<br>
    there as our slaves. Kareen will<br>
    never want for anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And what of Data? Your<br>
    &quot;grandson.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (chuckles)<br>
    What of him?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You took advantage of him.</p>
  <p> Data angrily rises and moves toward Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I did him a favor! I gave him<br>
    life!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You killed him! You're nothing<br>
    but a two-bit murderer!</p>
  <p> Data lunges at Picard and grabs his throat with both<br>
    hands. Picard strains to free himself but the android<br>
    hands are incredibly strong. Picard is beginning to<br>
    turn blue.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You call me a murderer?! I'll<br>
    show you what murder is.</p>

    You've become a monster.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Don't say that, Kareen. He<br>
    attacked me --</p>

  <p> Breathing hard, Picard watches as she goes up to Data<br>
    with fire in her eyes...</p>

    Stop... please...</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    The thought of ever living with<br>
    something like you makes me sick.</p>
  <p> Data is weakening by the moment. The fury of her<br>
    verbal assault is bringing out all of his insecurities<br>
    and paranoia, making him a basket case.</p>

    back and prepares to slap her...</p>

    Are you going to kill me too?</p>
  <p> The thought of what he was about to do terrifies Data.<br>

    shame...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You hate me... What can I do, what<br>
    can I do?</p>
  <p> KAREEN<br>
    Leave that body. It doesn't<br>
    belong to you.</p>
  <p> Data looks her in the eye. He is emotionally<br>
    devastated. He gives her just the ghost of a smile (is<br>
    he relieved?) and then hurries to the turbolift.</p>
  <p> Alone with Kareen, the recovering Picard gives her a<br>
    hug. We can see by her eyes that this experience was<br>
    just as devastating for her. Her hatred was a forced<br>
    hatred.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data! Data, can you hear me?</p>
  <p> Data's eyes pop open. They are clear and inquisitive<br>

    same thing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you just did.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Quite correct. May I ask you<br>
    another question after this one?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No questions. Just tell me a<br>
    joke. The funniest joke in<br>
    history.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    All right. There were twelve...<br>

  <p> his eyebrows arching in surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    -- I've heard more than enough<br>
    to know you're you again.</p>
  <p> Data has no idea what that means. As the others help<br>
    the android to his feet, Picard notices that Kareen is<br>
    standing away from the others, staring at the computer<br>

    He's in there. Ira put himself<br>
