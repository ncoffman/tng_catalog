    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moves along at warp speed.</p>
  <p>2 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> RIKER has cleared a space on his desk and set up a<br>
    little work station. He has a bowl and several<br>
    strange-looking eggs. Some smaller containers with<br>
    other ingredients and condiments for what appears to<br>
    be an omelet. He breaks the last egg into the bowl<br>
    and whips them with a jerry-rigged whisk. He is<br>
    obviously enjoying himself. The CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens; it's DATA and GEORDI carrying what look<br>
    like a homemade Bunsen burner and a frying pan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Excellent. Exactly what I need.</p>
  <p> Before the door closes, PULASKI appears, carrying<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, Doctor, and bearing gifts?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Ale from Ennan Six... your omelets<br>
    deserve no less.</p>
  <p> Again before the door can close, WORF appears and<br>
    follows them into the room.</p>
  <p>3 THE TABLE</p>
  <p> Riker sets up the &quot;Bunsen-type burner,&quot; ignites it,<br>
    heats the pan and pours in the beaten eggs, while Data<br>
    watches.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is not an efficient method<br>
    for the preparation of sustenance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're right, Data. The ship's<br>
    computer is much more efficient,<br>
    but it lacks the subtlety needed<br>
    for great cooking. It mixes the<br>
    ingredients to precise<br>
    measurements. There's no flair,<br>
    no individuality, and Data, as<br>
    we both know... inspiration and<br>
    flair are the difference between<br>
    artistry and mere competence.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    For much of the history of<br>
    mankind, the breaking of bread<br>
    was a sign of friendship and<br>
    community. Something we have<br>
    gotten away from in the<br>
    twenty-fourth century.<br>
    (re: Riker and the<br>
    whisk)<br>
    You have a practiced hand,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have my father to thank for<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh, your father liked to cook?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, he hated it. It was a chore<br>
    left to me.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is my understanding that in<br>
    most human families, the woman<br>
    shares in the cooking.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There were only the two of us.<br>
    I never knew my mother. She died<br>
    when I was very young.</p>
  <p>4 PULASKI</p>
  <p> as she pours the ale -</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 DATA</p>
  <p> as he takes a sip.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Where did you get the eggs?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    During our last stop.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with surprise)<br>
    At Starbase seventy-three?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p>6 SCENE</p>
  <p> as Riker dishes up the food. And they all sit down<br>
    to eat, all eager to enjoy the meal. Geordi is the<br>
    first to taste it; it clearly does not suit his palate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What kind of eggs did you say<br>
    these are?</p>
  <p> As Riker takes a bite:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    'Owon.</p>
  <p> From Geordi's expression it's apparent the eggs are<br>
    lacking. Riker and Pulaski both react to the uneatable<br>
    food.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A cook's only as good as his<br>
    ingredients.</p>
  <p> Then they look over at Worf, who is enjoying it<br>
    immensely.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Delicious.</p>
  <p> Something to end the scene.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Riker...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Would you join me on the bridge?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> Without having to be told, Data and Worf leave with<br>
    him. Worf pausing to take one last forkful of omelet.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and Worf ENTER and take their positions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have picked up an automated<br>
    signal from a Federation<br>
    shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> Riker looks surprised and confused.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A shuttle? Out here?! How is<br>
    that possible? We're the first<br>
    manned Federation vessel to enter<br>
    this area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently not.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So what's a shuttle doing out this<br>
    far? And where's the mother ship?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors indicate there is at least<br>
    one life-form on board the<br>
    shuttle. Humanoid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps someone to answer your<br>
    questions, Number One. Open<br>
    hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the shuttle is without<br>
    power. Communication is not<br>
    possible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set course to intercept.</p>

  <p> comes out of warp.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 42679.2.<br>
    While traversing an unexplored<br>
    section of the galaxy en route<br>
    to the Endicor system, a<br>
    Federation shuttlecraft has quite<br>
    suddenly appeared -- virtually out<br>
    of nowhere. There are no other<br>
    ships in the vicinity -- and no<br>
    indications whence it came nor<br>
    how it got out here.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The bridge is as before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are closing on shuttlecraft.</p>

  <p>12 ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the image changes and the shuttle appears -- it is<br>
    out of control -- cartwheeling through space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> The image changes again. The shuttle now appears in<br>
    close-up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf -- you're with me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor Pulaski, you are needed<br>
    in Shuttle Bay Two.</p>
  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I have been monitoring. I am<br>
    on my way.</p>
  <p>19 INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The doors have been opened. The shuttle, held firmly<br>
    by the tractor beam, is being pulled toward the<br>
    Enterprise, as Riker and Worf ENTER.</p>
  <p>20 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the shuttle moves closer. An n.d. crewmember, at a<br>
    control panel near the door, attaches a second tractor<br>
    beam, which automatically releases the first -- stronger<br>
    one -- and transfers control to the n.d. operator.</p>
  <p>21 RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> They move closer as the shuttlecraft is pulled on<br>
    board.</p>
  <p>22 SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it settles on the floor.</p>
  <p> The doors are closing as the tractor beam disengages.</p>
  <p>23 SCENE</p>
  <p> As Riker and Worf move closer, Doctor Pulaski ENTERS<br>
    the Shuttle Bay with an assistant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, it's a Federation shuttle<br>
    all right.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yet, there are no Federation<br>
    vessels or bases in this area.</p>
  <p> Riker steps closer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>24 RIKER AND SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> He reads the registration number. On the other side<br>
    of the craft, Pulaski and two n.d. crewmembers are<br>
    working to open the shuttle door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reading)<br>
    NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS<br>
    Enterprise, shuttle number<br>
    five.</p>
  <p> He turns in shock and stares at Worf. Riker looks back<br>
    at the registration number to be sure he read it<br>
    correctly. Riker then looks to the other side of the<br>
    Shuttle Bay...</p>
  <p>25 SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ... to another shuttlecraft, identical in design to the<br>
    one which was just brought on board, and carrying the<br>
    exact same number.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reading)<br>
    NCC one-seven-zero-one-D -- USS<br>
    Enterprise shuttle number<br>
    five.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How is this possible?</p>
  <p>26 OTHER SIDE OF SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> The crewmembers get the door open. Pulaski starts to<br>
    enter, then freezes. Pulaski calls out:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Commander! Come here!</p>
  <p>27 RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> The urgency in her voice sends Riker and Worf quickly<br>
    around to the other side of the shuttle where:</p>
  <p>28 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Pulaski steps back to allow Riker to look in.</p>
  <p><br>
    STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>29 RIKER</p>
  <p> Instantly he understands the reason for Pulaski's<br>
    reaction.</p>
  <p>30 SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> Slumped over the controls is CAPTAIN JEAN-LUC PICARD.<br>
    Unconscious, but otherwise exactly the same as the man<br>
    we just left on the bridge!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (he touches his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    What is it, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, are you on the bridge?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (irritated)<br>
    Where else would I be?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Right now, I think you had better<br>
    be in Shuttle Bay Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Why? What is it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This you had better see for<br>
    yourself and, Captain, bring<br>
    Commander Data.</p>
  <p>31 ANOTHER ANGLE - SHUTTLE BAY TWO</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER. Pulaski is in the shuttle<br>
    checking P2's condition. The tension level in the<br>
    room is very high. Without being called, TROI<br>
    instinctively ENTERS the Shuttle Bay.</p>
  <p>32 PICARD</p>
  <p> as he moves closer he sees what has them all so<br>
    concerned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>33 INTERCUT</p>
  <p> the others, all waiting to see how Picard is going to<br>
    react.</p>
  <p>34 PICARD</p>
  <p> moves closer, wanting to be certain his eyes are<br>
    telling him the truth. Riker moves up next to him.<br>
    For a beat they both watch Pulaski as she does her<br>
    medical checks.</p>
  <p>35 SCENE</p>
  <p> Data is nearby, waiting to enter the shuttle as soon as<br>
    Pulaski is clear.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have been in a lot of bizarre<br>
    situations, but nothing like this.</p>
  <p> Picard's response comes out as a grunt. Seeing a<br>
    duplicate of himself, in a duplicate of an Enterprise<br>
    shuttlecraft, has put Picard and the others under<br>
    enormous strain, so much so that words come slowly. No<br>
    one knows what to say, and all are waiting for some<br>
    explanation about what's going on. This all plays off<br>
    Picard, who is the most involved. In a strange way the<br>
    crew avoids making eye contract with Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's his condition?</p>
  <p>36 SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Pulaski completes her scan.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The life signs are confusing.<br>
    I get a strong heartbeat, but the<br>
    rhythm is off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Has he been injured?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No signs of trauma.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why is he unconscious? What<br>
    happened to him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I can't say.</p>
  <p> As she scans P2's head she gently touches his face, as<br>
    if double checking her readings.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The readings from his brain waves<br>
    are very... strange.</p>
  <p> Little alarm bells go off for Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange? In what way? Non-human?<br>
    Artificial?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No -- neither. They are just out<br>
    of phase.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you revive him?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I won't attempt it until he's in<br>
    Sickbay.<br>
    (she holds the look for<br>
    a beat, then:)<br>
    Let's get him there.</p>
  <p> Pulaski and her medical team remove P2.</p>
  <p>37 PICARD AND TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Both are confounded.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have never felt anything quite<br>
    like this so it is difficult to<br>
    put into words.<br>
    (she pauses to gather<br>
    her thoughts)<br>
    That person is you. What I mean,<br>
    the person we are looking at is<br>
    as much Jean-Luc Picard as the<br>
    person I am standing next to;<br>
    beyond that there's very little<br>
    of which I am sure. I will have<br>
    to wait until he is conscious<br>
    before knowing more.</p>
  <p>38 SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data, we have to know what is on<br>
    the shuttle's logs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Data enters the damaged shuttle.</p>
  <p>39 INT./EXT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Data takes the command position and attempts to<br>
    activate the system.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Both primary and reserve power<br>
    has been drained from the shuttle.<br>
    I am going to have to connect<br>
    to the Enterprise in order to<br>
    activate the shuttle's systems.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge -- report to<br>
    Shuttle Bay Two.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, I'll be in Sickbay.<br>
    Keep me informed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (indicating an unusual<br>
    burn on the skin of<br>
    the shuttle)<br>
    Did you see this, Captain?</p>
  <p> Picard steps over to the shuttle and examines the burn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It looks like the kind of damage<br>
    caused by an antimatter explosion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, the shuttle must have been<br>
    just out of range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Data, I need those logs.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Counselor.</p>
  <p> As Picard and Troi EXIT:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll be on the bridge.</p>
  <p> He and Worf EXIT as Geordi ARRIVES.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The power requirements of the<br>
    shuttle do not match the<br>

    align the power from the<br>
    Enterprise to the circuits of the<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, what do you think is going<br>
    on? I don't just mean about the<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not have enough information.</p>

  <p>44 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi are approaching Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This smells like a set-up.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    A trap?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods, yes)<br>
    If it is me, me from where? And<br>
    why in a shuttle? There is<br>
    nothing about this which is random<br>
    or happenstance. Look beneath<br>
    the boards, Counselor; I expect<br>
    something foul and familiar to<br>
    crawl out.</p>
  <p> Picard holds her look for a beat, then turns and ENTERS<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p>45 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They have placed P2 in the center of Sickbay. Pulaski<br>
    is doing her medical work-ups.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We have just started doing a<br>
    complete work-up. The vital signs<br>
    are distorted. Some of the<br>
    indicators are totally depressed,<br>
    others are fluctuating wildly.<br>
    I can't explain any of it. But<br>
    he is alive, and I don't think<br>
    he's in any immediate danger.</p>
  <p> She activates a forcefield, which briefly appears as<br>
    a restraining device.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The restraints are for his own<br>
    protection.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you been able to determine<br>
    why he is still unconscious?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT ONE 16A.</p>

  <p> She touches the hypospray to his neck. Suddenly all of<br>
    the indicators fall to zero. Pulaski quickly adjusts<br>
    her hypospray and gives P2 another injection. While<br>
    they watch, the indicators return to their previous<br>
    readings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What happened?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Apparently a normal stimulant had<br>
    the opposite effect. I'll have<br>
    to try something else.</p>
  <p> She steps over to a counter to prepare a different<br>
    injection. Picard moves slightly closer to himself.</p>
  <p>46 INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are working together to synchronize the<br>
    power from the Enterprise with the circuits of the<br>
    shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There... that should give you<br>
    something. Making this power<br>
    adjustment is very tricky. By<br>
    all rights, this connection should<br>
    overload all the shuttle's<br>

  <p> Data steps over to the shuttle control position.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps you had better step back<br>
    out of the way.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. Part<br>
    of the mystery has been solved.<br>
    The reason there are two NCC<br>
    one-seven-zero-one-D-five<br>
    shuttlecrafts is because one of<br>
    them is from the future... six<br>
    hours to be exact. And, so<br>
    presumably is the facsimile of<br>
    me.</p>
  <p>51 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard is there with Pulaski and Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try to wake him, again.</p>
  <p> Pulaski gives Picard a little look, then adjusts her<br>
    hypospray and touches it to P2's neck.</p>
  <p>52 P2</p>
  <p> ... he becomes conscious. His face is a mask of<br>
    terror, pain and fear. His head rolls back and he<br>
    tries to scream, but no sound comes. As he looks<br>
    around, his movements have a strange stuttering<br>
    quality.</p>
  <p>53 PICARD</p>
  <p> He reacts to seeing himself as he has never felt, nor<br>
    ever thought he would feel, out of control and<br>
    impotent.</p>
  <p>54 PULASKI</p>
  <p> She moves to comfort P2, but his flaying hands hold her<br>
    off. His movements come in a series of stutters. He's<br>
    here - in this Sickbay, on this ship, but if as though<br>
    he were in another dimension as well.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>55 PICARD</p>
  <p> Troi is close beside him. They watch as:</p>
  <p>56 P2</p>
  <p> He pushes in his herky-jerky way against an unseen wall<br>
    behind which he is imprisoned. His mouth is open --<br>
    but still there is no sound.</p>
  <p>57 PICARD</p>
  <p> The terror of seeing himself in such a condition. A<br>
    little sound comes from him... It's primal, in response<br>
    to what he sees and the anguish he feels from his<br>
    otherself's helpless condition.</p>
  <p>58 SCENE</p>
  <p> Pulaski responds to seeing a patient in this condition,<br>
    steps up to touch the hypospray to P2's neck.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No!</p>
  <p> The word explodes from him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's a only a sedative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know what it is... don't sedate<br>
    him. Let him be!<br>
    (then, changing his<br>
    tone)<br>
    Please... allow him to remain<br>
    conscious.</p>
  <p>59 P2</p>
  <p> If P2 is aware of his surroundings, it would be<br>
    impossible to tell. But clearly he is in some kind of<br>
    horror chamber, from which he cannot escape.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I have never seen anything like<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Pulaski looks over at Picard. The color has been<br>
    drained from his face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, you had better sit down.</p>
  <p> Picard waves her off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm fine, Doctor... Save your<br>
    ministrations for the patient.<br>
    I want a staff meeting in five<br>
    minutes. Doctor, I assume you<br>
    will want to remain here.</p>
  <p> She acknowledges with a nod. Picard turns and heads<br>
    for the exit.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I will monitor the conference<br>
    from here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep me informed, Doctor -- of any<br>
    change no matter how small.</p>
  <p>60 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker is there with Picard, Data, Geordi, Worf and<br>
    Troi. Pulaski is still in Sickbay with P2.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, we have retrieved all<br>
    we are going to get from the<br>
    shuttle logs, including the last<br>
    visual records. Everything before<br>
    this is just a jumble.</p>
  <p>61 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p>62 DATA</p>
  <p> He inputs the computer pad in front of him.</p>
  <p>63 SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> An image appears on the viewscreen. It's slightly<br>
    distorted.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The distortion is because we had<br>
    to use a phase inverter to<br>
    retrieve the logs. It will<br>
    improve slightly.</p>
  <p> The image changes, but the quality does not noticeably<br>
    improve.</p>
  <p>64 PICARD</p>
  <p> watches transfixed.</p>
  <p>65 SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It's the shuttle's on-board camera. As the shuttle<br>
    doors open, we see that the Enterprise is surrounded by<br>
    a maelstrom of energy - a chaos of swirling, violent<br>
    colors.</p>
  <p> The scene shifts, to a camera angle looking back at the<br>
    Shuttle Bay. Riker is standing there. His expression<br>
    is both pained and very concerned. He gives a little<br>
    motion with his hand. It's difficult to tell the<br>
    meaning of the motion.</p>
  <p>66 RIKER</p>
  <p> Here in the Observation Lounge, his face shows the same<br>
    concern.</p>
  <p>67 THE SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the shuttle slowly leaves -- then quickly accelerates<br>
    away until we see the Enterprise from the point of view<br>
    of the shuttlecraft. It is surrounded by a swirling<br>
    cacophony of energy and colors. It's like being on the<br>
    edge of a great whirlpool. There is a lot of buffeting -- both<br>
    the shuttle and the Enterprise are being thrown<br>
    about.</p>
  <p>68 PICARD</p>
  <p> He is very intent on the scene before him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>69 SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The turmoil around the Enterprise increases. Then,<br>
    without a sound... the Enterprise is literally torn<br>
    apart, by a great, yet unseen force. Right on the<br>
    screen -- before their eyes -- the ship is destroyed.<br>
    Then the screen goes blank.</p>
  <p>70 REACTIONS FROM EVERYONE</p>
  <p> Picard turns away from the screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to the shuttle log, the<br>
    Enterprise was destroyed three<br>
    hours, nineteen minutes from now.</p>
  <p> The room is silent for a beat, then:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, we have a portion of your<br>
    last log entry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Data activates the control panel on the table in front<br>
    of him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's audio only.</p>
  <p> There is a pause, then a strange phasing sound,<br>
    followed by the distorted but understandable voice of<br>
    Captain Picard. There is:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's personal log,<br>
    supplemental.<br>
    (there is a long pause)<br>
    For the record... I have just<br>
    witnessed the total destruction<br>
    of the USS Enterprise with a loss<br>
    of all hands, save one. Me.</p>
  <p> The entry ends with a very strange sound.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That last sound apparently<br>
    occurred when the shuttle was<br>
    thrown back in time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>71 REACTIONS</p>
  <p> There is a long pause as those in the room try to<br>
    absorb and comprehend what they have just seen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All attempts to obtain additional<br>
    information from the shuttle's<br>
    logs have failed.</p>
  <p> Picard nods an acknowledgement.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At least now we have something<br>
    to go on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't understand how you could<br>
    end up in a shuttlecraft while<br>
    the Enterprise is being destroyed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Nor I, the last thing you would<br>
    do is leave the bridge of the<br>
    Enterprise during an emergency.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but let's proceed on the<br>
    premise that what we have just<br>
    seen is factual and that somehow,<br>
    in less than four hours, the<br>
    Enterprise will be destroyed and<br>
    somehow -- although this is<br>
    unfathomable -- I, and I alone<br>
    escaped. Discussion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our destination is the Endicor<br>
    system. We are not due to arrive<br>
    for three days. The charts<br>
    indicate nothing of consequence,<br>
    certainly nothing which could<br>
    threaten the Enterprise, between<br>
    here and there.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sensors indicated no other vessels<br>
    -- Federation or otherwise -- in<br>
    this area.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 24A.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have nothing to offer. There<br>
    is not enough information upon<br>
    which I can base a hypothesis.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, the shuttle apparently came<br>
    from somewhere up ahead. Rather<br>
    than continuing on this course,<br>
    perhaps we should stop here and<br>
    let whatever is out there come<br>
    and find us.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think it's already too late for<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are you saying that stopping,<br>
    turning left, or right, or even<br>
    reversing course, is pointless?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    When we brought the shuttle and<br>
    the other Picard on board, we<br>
    committed ourselves to a sequence<br>
    of events which may be<br>
    unalterable.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, this isn't a rock in the road<br>
    which once seen can be avoided.<br>
    It's much more complex.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is the theory of the<br>
    moebius, a twist in the fabric of<br>
    space where time becomes a loop<br>
    from which there is no escape.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So, when we reach that moment --<br>
    whatever happened will happen<br>
    again... The Enterprise will be<br>
    destroyed, the &quot;other Picard&quot; sent<br>
    back to meet with us and do it<br>
    all over again.<br>
    (he shudders)<br>
    That sounds like someone's<br>
    definition of hell.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know this much -- we can't avoid<br>
    the future.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed. So let's continue on<br>
    course. Everyone return to your<br>
    duty stations. Somewhere out<br>
    there something will happen...<br>
    a decision will be made which<br>
    will cause me to become separated<br>
    from the Enterprise -- at the time<br>
    that decision will seem correct,<br>
    but it won't be. We have to<br>
    anticipate and not make the same<br>
    mistake once. Something is<br>
    waiting for us out there -- let's<br>
    determine what it is as quickly<br>
    as possible.</p>

  <p> Riker sits in the Command Chair and stares at the Main<br>

    level on the bridge is very high.</p>
  <p>73 INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO</p>
  <p> Data is there with Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (he studies the shuttle)<br>
    Data -- I think the molecular<br>
    structure of the shuttle has<br>
    changed!</p>
  <p> Data takes a tricorder and makes a scan.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your assessment is accurate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps it always was unstable<br>
    and it was only by leaving and<br>
    coming back that you were able<br>
    to see the change.</p>
  <p>74 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Pulaski is doing further tests on P2, as Picard ENTERS<br>
    with Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I am beginning to realize just<br>
    how much of the body is held<br>
    together by its own internal<br>
    clock. You -- he was thrown out<br>
    of time, which caused the body<br>
    systems to change their rhythms.<br>
    Slowly, as we move closer to the<br>
    time he left, the internal body<br>
    clocks are realigning.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're saying, when our time<br>
    intersects with the time he left,<br>
    at that instant he will be<br>
    functioning normally. And there<br>
    will be two of us.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Right now, that would be my guess.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't believe that is possible.</p>
  <p> Pulaski pauses as the thought hits her.</p>
  <p> Troi has moved over closer to P2. She is watching him<br>
    intently.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I am able to feel more<br>
    from him now. Much of his<br>
    emotions are still a jumble,<br>
    but...</p>
  <p> She steps even closer. Her eyes shut as she<br>
    concentrates. P2 flinches in the same stuttering way.<br>
    His body jerks back. His face contorts.</p>
  <p> His hands reach out and grab Troi. For a moment<br>
    nothing -- then she screams, in agony. P2... throws<br>
    back his head but no sound comes out. Pulaski rushes<br>
    to Troi. As she touches her, Troi collapses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What did you feel?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Only that he wants desperately<br>
    to leave this ship.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>

  <p> The tension level on the bridge is very high.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If the timetable is correct, we<br>
    should get an indication of<br>
    something very soon.</p>
  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge, this is Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PULASKI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, my patient is more<br>
    coherent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll be right there.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and goes to the turbolift.</p>

  <p>79 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. (He pauses at the doorway and watches<br>
    Pulaski and P2).</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is he?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    His vital signs are more normal -- which<br>
    is to say, more like ours.<br>
    He is calmer.</p>
  <p> Indeed as Picard approaches him, P2 becomes more<br>
    agitated.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is now aware of me.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In some fashion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sotto, almost to<br>
    himself)<br>
    But, does he know where he is,<br>
    and who's here with him?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I doubt it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (then to P2)<br>
    What went wrong?</p>
  <p> P2 turns away. Like a bizarre painting by Goya, a<br>
    face frozen in agony.</p>
  <p> Picard moves a step closer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You know... don't you?</p>
  <p> P2 turns back and faces Picard -- but his eyes still do<br>
    not make contact. It's impossible to tell whether he<br>
    hears Picard or not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What did you do? What happened?<br>
    Why did you leave the ship?</p>
  <p> P2 -- just trying to orient himself as much as anything -- turns<br>
    his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't turn away. Look at me.</p>
  <p> Without being summoned, but somehow knowing that she is<br>
    needed, Troi appears in the doorway behind them and<br>
    slowly approaches as Picard continues to try and make<br>
    contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Picard!</p>
  <p> He speaks the name as if it belongs to another, and at<br>
    this moment it does.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    LOOK AT ME!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He doesn't understand you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He knows I'm here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, as part of a nightmare of<br>
    disjointed images, half-heard<br>
    voices. He is in another<br>
    dimension -- seeing us across a<br>
    great chasm -- and he's filled with<br>
    remorse at what he has witnessed,<br>
    and he's afraid.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is he afraid of?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Troi doesn't have that specific answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; back to<br>
    P2)<br>
    Damn you -- help me! Why did you<br>
    leave the ship?</p>
  <p> Now, for the first time, P2 turns and looks Picard full<br>
    in the face. Through what must be a blur of shifting<br>
    and nightmarish images, P2 tries to focus.</p>
  <p>80 P2</p>
  <p> He leans forward. Like a sailor straining against the<br>
    fog, then with a grimace made up of frustration and<br>
    rage, he turns away. For the first time we hear a<br>
    sound from his lips. It's strange -- otherworldish.</p>
  <p>81 SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard takes a step forward. For a second it looks as<br>
    if Picard is going to grab P2 and shake him. But he<br>
    only glares at him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's no use, Captain. He can't<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    As we get closer to the time he<br>
    left, he may be able to.</p>
  <p> Picard steps back, frustration etched on his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Are you still convinced he is me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes -- but you're not.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not in the slightest. Except for<br>
    his features there is nothing<br>
    about him which I find familiar.</p>
  <p> He turns to leave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 31A.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I want you to stay with him. He<br>
    will be able to communicate with<br>
    you before any of the rest of us.</p>
  <p> Picard then turns and EXITS.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't know how long anyone can<br>
    take this kind of schizophrenia.<br>
    There has to be a breaking point.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is handling it very well.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He has a lot of anger.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. Because of what...<br>
    (indicating P2)<br>
    ... he represents.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    And what is that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Doubt. Seeing him here and<br>
    knowing what happened to the<br>
    Enterprise could make him timid<br>
    or, worse, cause him to hesitate.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    When he said -- that there is<br>
    nothing familiar about him...<br>
    (re P2)<br>
    ... except his features. It<br>
    sounded like a form of denial.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's his accurate feelings.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Part of my job is to anticipate<br>
    problems. I have a duty to the<br>
    captain, but first to the ship<br>
    and its crew.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 31B.</p>
  <p>81 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Doctor, the captain is fully<br>
    capable of command decisions.</p>
  <p> Pulaski is pensive for a beat.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes... for now. But... this<br>
    situation has put enormous<br>
    pressure -- of a unique and very<br>
    personal nature -- on Captain<br>
    Picard. And we both know that<br>
    pressure is going to increase.<br>
    You said he already has doubt.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, which is necessary and<br>
    healthy.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    But could potentially paralyze.<br>
    If we begin to see signs that he<br>
    is acting in an irrational manner,<br>
    then I have the authority and the<br>
    duty to relieve him.</p>
  <p> Troi nods.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I do not think that will be<br>
    necessary.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I hope you're right.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What force or phenomenon could<br>
    cause a shuttle to be thrown back<br>
    in time?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    None that we have ever<br>
    encountered. In theory,<br>
    accelerating beyond warp ten.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Using the gravitational pull of<br>
    a star to &quot;slingshot&quot; back in<br>
    time. Is that what happened here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The shuttle doesn't have warp<br>
    capability.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Some external force was<br>
    needed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have never encountered any<br>
    natural force that powerful. And<br>
    why only six hours? Why not a<br>
    day? A year?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>88 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you suggesting there is a<br>
    conscious mind at work here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There is no evidence either way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Traveler moved through time<br>
    with the power of his mind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think that's the case<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    No -- and Manheim's experiments<br>
    with gravity and time were<br>
    rudimentary, and uncontrollable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, this is one instant<br>
    where you must suppress your<br>
    natural tendencies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (then more as a friend<br>
    than a subordinate,<br>
    or even a fellow<br>
    officer)<br>
    Your strength, Jean-Luc, is your<br>
    ability to evaluate the dynamics<br>
    of a situation, step in and make<br>
    the definitive, preemptive move.<br>
    You take charge. You're<br>
    frustrated now because, not only<br>
    can't you see the solution... you<br>
    can't even define the problem.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go on.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I wouldn't have used those exact<br>
    words... but, yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't do that well.</p>

    It's your Persian Flaw.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    What do you make of it, Number<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I would say we're being probed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The beam is coming directly from<br>
    the center of the vortex. Sensors<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it trying to learn?</p>

    I think it is trying to determine<br>
    if we are a life force.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We should stay and investigate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But, was that the mistake?</p>
  <p> Riker looks at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Possibly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We should go now.</p>
  <p> Riker is unsure of his response -- he has never seen<br>
    Picard so indecisive. While this is going on, Geordi<br>

    We're like a rag in a dog's mouth.</p>

    I am now at maximum warp.</p>
  <p> The ship is hammered by another wave of energy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's you, Captain. It was the<br>
    entire ship, but now it has turned<br>
    its attention completely on you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, I can't hold it. If we<br>
    don't shut down, we are going to<br>
    explode.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, what if I were to leave<br>
    the Enterprise? Would its<br>
    attention stay focused on me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. I think it would.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'd never survive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But, maybe in those few seconds -- the<br>
    Enterprise could break free.<br>
    In any case, that's what he...<br>

    Prepare a shuttle, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're leaving the ship?!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have to make a stop in Sickbay.<br>
    We may be on a road which has no<br>

  <p>124 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS -- Pulaski is there with Troi and P2.<br>
    There is a moment of near recognition from P2, then he<br>
    avoids eye contact with Picard. P2 now appears to be<br>
    physically closer to normal. P2 is much closer to<br>
    being in sync.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's very agitated.</p>
  <p> P2's eyes dart around the room. Picard steps over in<br>
    front of P2 to make and hold eye contact. P2 looks<br>
    off.</p>
  <p>125 ANOTHER ANGLE - P2</p>
  <p> P2<br>

    Do you know where you are?</p>

    The Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Picard is relieved -</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you're only vaguely aware of<br>
    it. And me -- do you know who I<br>
    am?</p>
  <p> P2 deflects the question. He's in a living nightmare.<br>
    He has no answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    No. You don't.</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    I must go.</p>
  <p> P2 tries to rise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Release him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Do you know what you are doing?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No -- release him!</p>
  <p> Pulaski deactivates the forcefield, which again appears<br>
    briefly, and P2 is released.</p>

    Security to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Security, this is the<br>
    captain -- disregard that order.<br>
    And clear all personnel -- repeat,<br>
    all personnel -- from Shuttle Bay<br>
    Two. I don't want any<br>

    I must.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    The energy in the vortex wants<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're certain.</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    Yes... it's an entity -- a<br>
    life-form which recognizes the<br>
    Enterprise as an entity with me<br>
    as the brain, and it wants me.</p>
  <p> P2's level of anxiety is rising, as they turn...</p>
  <p>127B INT. TURBOLIFT</p>

  <p> P2<br>
    Shuttle Bay Number Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's your other option?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    This is our only chance. If I<br>
    leave, it might be distracted long<br>
    enough for the Enterprise to<br>
    escape.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are wrong. Leaving won't save<br>
    your ship. Don't you remember?<br>
    It was destroyed -- you saw it<br>
    happen.</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    If I don't leave the Enterprise,<br>
    the ship will be destroyed.</p>
  <p> The turbolift comes to a stop and the doors open.<br>

  <p> Picard and P2 continue heading toward Shuttle Bay Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If that's true, then help me.<br>
    We want the same thing. We want<br>
    the Enterprise to be safe.<br>
    There has to be a piece of<br>
    information which I don't have.<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    It's me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You?</p>
  <p> They are interrupted by Riker's COM VOICE.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We are about to lose warp drive.</p>
  <p> PICARD &amp; P2<br>
    (in sync, they respond<br>
    to Riker)<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> Only Picard reacts to this bizarre occurrence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When you say it's &quot;you,&quot; do you<br>
    mean it's still you? And it's<br>
    not me -- just you. Has this<br>
    entity singled you out -- somehow<br>
    making a connection?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    You're confusing me. We're<br>
    almost out of time.</p>
  <p>127C INT. SHUTTLE BAY TWO</p>
  <p> The doors open and the two Picards ENTER. P2 is<br>
    heading directly for the shuttle.</p>

  <p>127C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    I must get to the shuttle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wait. You can -- I'll let you,<br>
    hell, man, I'll go with you, but<br>
    first tell me. What is -- what<br>
    was, your other choice?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    Stand aside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't know what I'm talking<br>
    about. You're frozen with a<br>
    single thought -- unable to change -- unable<br>
    to alter any part of your<br>
    previous actions.</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    I must leave -- there's no other<br>
    way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There must be.</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    Only one -- but it would never<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it? What would never<br>
    work?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    Better to sacrifice myself than<br>
    destroy the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Destroy the Enterprise -- how?</p>
  <p> P2<br>
    I have to leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me -- what was your other<br>
    choice? We can't escape it -- we<br>
    can't fight it, we can't go<br>
    forward.</p>

    Was that it... Was that the other<br>
    choice?</p>

    No.</p>
  <p> P2 is about to climb into the shuttle. Picard pulls<br>
    his phaser.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can't allow it. Before we have<br>
    any chance of moving forward, the<br>
    cycle must end.</p>
  <p> Then, without further comment, he fires the phaser.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything about it seemed a tick<br>
    off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He certainly did not act like me,<br>
    at least not the way I think I<br>
    act.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe none of it was real... we<br>
    could have just been part of a<br>
    shared illusion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or maybe &quot;he&quot; was thrown back in<br>
    time so that we would be able to<br>
    take another road... make another<br>
    choice?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That suggests a moral force,<br>
    giving us the opportunity... or<br>
    specifically giving you the<br>
    opportunity to right a wrong.</p>
  <p> Picard is pensive for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Riker has his cooking equipment in place. He has<br>
    already placed all of the ingredients in a cooking<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS with Pulaski and Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know you were all disappointed<br>
    with my last culinary effort.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not all.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, Worf. Anyway,<br>
    considering the stress of the last<br>
    few days, I thought we could use<br>
    a little diversion and at the same<br>
    time I could make amends for the<br>
    'Owon omelet.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    So what are you preparing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The specialty of the house,<br>
    Alaskan stew.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not with ingredients you picked<br>
    up at Starbase seventy-three?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No -- I had the computer fabricate<br>
    everything. The potatoes, the<br>
    onions, the flour, and the meat.</p>

  <p>142A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Meat? What kind of meat?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ahh... Well, to be authentic I<br>
    needed moose. But, I couldn't<br>
    find the specific molecular<br>
    pattern for moose, so I had to<br>
    improvise. The computer came<br>
    close...</p>
  <p> Riker fills their plates.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... actually, it's somewhere<br>
    between venison -- musk ox -- and<br>
    Kobe beef.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I thought that humans had long ago<br>
    given up the practice of raising<br>
    animals for food.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There were a couple of winters<br>
    when it was either starve or hunt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How fortunate.</p>
  <p> Pulaski looks down at her plate.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'll give you this -- your stew<br>
    smells a lot better than the eggs.</p>
  <p> They taste it. Reactions around.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is quite good.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Worf's expression is one of revulsion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No good, Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time Squared&quot; - REV. 2/7/89 - ACT FIVE 51C.</p>
