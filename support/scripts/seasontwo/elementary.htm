    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is motionless.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42486.3.<br>
    We have arrived on station at<br>
    coordinates -- three-six-two-<br>
    nine-mark-five-eight-four,<br>
    three days early for our<br>
    rendezvous with USS Victory.<br>
    There is nothing to do now, but<br>
    hold this position and wait.</p>
  <p>1 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR AT TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> as the doors snap open and DATA comes out, hurries down<br>
    the corridor toward the Engineering Section. He<br>
    appears concerned about something.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> as Data hurries in from the corridor to the ASSISTANT<br>
    ENGINEER, a pert redhead female, who is on duty.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT ENGINEER<br>
    Yes, Commander?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Is there a problem? Chief<br>
    Engineer La Forge called for me.<br>
    &quot;Urgent!&quot;</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT ENGINEER<br>
    Oh, of course.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    He's over there with the Victory.</p>
  <p> A very puzzled Data heads in the direction indicated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INT. GEORDI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> where GEORDI is making an adjustment on a computer<br>
    panel. Data enters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I just had a strange conversation<br>
    with your assistant. Although<br>
    it is three days until we<br>
    rendezvous with Starship Victory,<br>
    she...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (grins; overlapping)<br>
    She believes it has already<br>
    arrived.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    But not the starship, my friend.<br>
    The original!</p>
  <p>4 PAN SHOT</p>
  <p> as Geordi leads Data to an Engine Room corner we<br>
    haven't seen so far. It is indeed the Victory sitting<br>
    there, a nearly completed five-foot model of it!<br>
    Geordi leads Data to it, then kneels and begins putting<br>
    some finishing touches on the model.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is my gift to Starship<br>
    Victory's Captain Zimbata.</p>
  <p>5 CLOSE ON THE VICTORY MODEL</p>
  <p> including Geordi's hands (establishing scale) as he<br>
    works on it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah, most unusual.</p>
  <p>6 MEDIUM SHOT</p>
  <p> Geordi, Data and model.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I served as an ensign under him.<br>
    (indicates model)<br>
    I wish he'd been in command of<br>
    this Victory. Wind and sail,<br>
    that's the proper way to move a<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi reaches in the model, adjusts something, CAMERA<br>
    MOVING IN as Data crouches to watch, puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But your Starfleet specialty, my<br>
    friend, is antimatter power,<br>
    dilithium regulators...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Which is exactly why this<br>
    fascinates me. Data, it's human<br>
    nature to love what we don't have.<br>
    Simpler days!<br>
    (indicates model)<br>
    While stringing this rigging, I<br>
    was dreaming of sail handling<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is not a computer simulation?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, the entire point of<br>
    something like this is to hand<br>
    make it.</p>
  <p> Data is leaning in, inspecting it even more carefully.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just as you have used Old England<br>
    in a hobby of your own.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi... your message said<br>
    &quot;urgent.&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And it is, my friend. While we<br>
    wait to rendezvous with Victory,<br>
    we have time for me to be Watson.</p>
  <p> Geordi produces a package, extends it to Data. Data<br>
    pulls from the package a meerschaum pipe.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    More properly, your Watson.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> It is the &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; pipe that Data used once<br>
    before and Data is obviously delighted with it. He<br>
    picks it up, tests the heft of it, moves it to his<br>
    lips.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My Watson?</p>
  <p>7 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Geordi stands; indicates model.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You've seen my dream adventure...<br>
    now let me share in one of yours.</p>
  <p> Data considers this, then lifts the meerschaum to<br>
    the lips again, plays it as &quot;Holmes.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah, yes. Yes, my dear colleague,<br>
    that does seem only fair.</p>
  <p> The assistant engineer has entered to check a computer<br>
    reading and Geordi beckons to her, indicates the model<br>
    Victory.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll be gone awhile, Clancy. See<br>
    that no one touches this!</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT ENGINEER<br>
    Aye, sir. And where can I reach<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He can be reached at 221B Baker<br>
    Street.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT ENGINEER<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> But the two of them are already exiting.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR AT HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are in front of the Holodeck entrance,<br>
    programming the COMPUTER. Geordi (dressed as WATSON)<br>
    is wearing Victorian trousers, waistcoat and tie,<br>
    jacket and bowler. Data is dressed in the classic<br>
    style of SHERLOCK HOLMES.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer -- select at random a<br>
    mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,<br>
    where I will play Sherlock Holmes<br>
    and Lieutenant La Forge will be<br>
    Doctor Watson.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Program complete -- you may enter.</p>
  <p> The Holodeck doors open onto:</p>
  <p>9 INT. HOLODECK - THE SITTING ROOM AT 221B BAKER<br>
    STREET - THE DIGS OF MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Holodeck doors become a wall of Holmes' sitting<br>
    room. It's all there. A perfect duplication of<br>
    Sherlock Holmes' famous sitting room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> The unlit oil lamps, the bookcase, the stick rack, the<br>
    fireplace and its softly flaming fire within, the<br>
    jack-knife stuck in the mantelpiece, the Persian<br>
    slipper tobacco pouch, the chemical bottles and<br>
    microscope, the deerstalker cap and cape-backed<br>
    overcoat, the spirit case and gasogene, a pistol, the<br>
    &quot;V.R.&quot; script of bullet holes in one wall...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Look at all of the detail... and<br>
    everything here has some<br>
    significance?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Holmes collected nothing -- neither<br>
    trinkets nor thoughts which were<br>
    not specifically significant to<br>
    him.</p>
  <p>10 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data surveys the room for authenticity -- Geordi makes<br>
    a walk around the room, picking up articles and<br>
    identifying them. He picks up a tie pin.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The emerald tie pin presented to<br>
    Holmes by Queen Victoria after<br>
    he solved the theft of the<br>
    Bruce-Partington plans.</p>
  <p> He touches a book.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A copy of Whitaker's Almanack<br>
    which provided Holmes the key to<br>
    the secret code in &quot;The Valley<br>
    of Fear.&quot;</p>
  <p> He picks up a snuff box from the mantel.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The snuff box of Wilhelm<br>
    Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein.</p>
  <p> Geordi marvels at the detail.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All right -- you solve the cases<br>
    and get the gifts, what do I do?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Primarily as Doctor Watson, you<br>
    keep a written record of<br>
    everything I do for later<br>
    publication.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>11 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data steps over and picks up the violin.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And the famous Holmes violin.<br>
    He purchased this in a pawn shop<br>
    in Tottenham Court Road for<br>
    fifty-five shillings, which he<br>
    considered a very good investment.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes pen in hand to begin the journal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In the hands of some, the violin<br>
    is a wondrous thing, equally<br>
    capable of stirring the soul to<br>
    the heights of bliss as to the<br>
    depths of despair...</p>
  <p>11A EMPHASIZING DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he picks up the bow... begins to play. His music<br>
    is surprisingly lovely. CAMERA PANS to Geordi as he<br>
    lowers the pen, impressed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Incredible, Data! How can you<br>
    play it like that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Merely throwing myself into the<br>
    part, Watson.</p>
  <p> Geordi picks up his pen again, begins writing:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In the masterful grasp of my<br>
    friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the<br>
    violin ceases to be a musical<br>
    instrument at all and becomes...</p>
  <p> Data puts down the violin as outside WE HEAR THE CLOMP<br>
    OF HORSES' HOOVES AND THE YELL OF A COACHMAN.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Watson! We are about to have<br>
    guests.</p>
  <p> Data digs into his pockets for his pipe. There is the<br>
    SOUND OF FEET ON THE STAIRS, THEN A KNOCK AT THE<br>
    DOOR...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Answer it, Watson -- let's not keep<br>
    the good inspector waiting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Inspector who?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why Lestrade of course.</p>
  <p> Geordi's on his feet, heading for the door as there<br>
    comes ANOTHER KNOCK, and LESTRADE'S VOICE:</p>
  <p> LESTRADE (O.S.)<br>
    Holmes, are you there, man?</p>
  <p> Geordi fumbles slightly as he opens the door, and into<br>
    the room come INSPECTOR G. LESTRADE and a MAN, wearing<br>
    a double-breasted overcoat and bowler... Lestrade nods<br>
    at Watson but crosses quickly toward Holmes as the man,<br>
    his collar up to partially obscure his face, slides<br>
    over to the darkest corner of the room and examines the<br>
    chemistry apparatus there...</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Thank the Almighty you're<br>
    available tonight, Holmes, I'm<br>
    in a deuce of a dilemma.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then may I say your perturbation<br>
    becomes you, Inspector Lestrade,<br>
    whilst simultaneously affording<br>
    me yet another chance to serve<br>
    Queen and country.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with a little laugh)<br>
    Data, is that the way Holmes<br>
    really talked?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> Data steps over to the Persian slipper tobacco pouch,<br>
    fills his pipe, tamps it, as:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Exactly... You see, this gentleman<br>
    here --<br>
    (indicates the man)<br>
    -- the emissary of a foreign<br>
    government -- has been the victim<br>
    of a most accidentally wicked<br>
    crime...</p>
  <p> The light over Watson's journal has flickered lower.<br>
    Geordi, not quite sure of how it works, tries to adjust<br>
    it and breaks Lestrade's concentration as the lamp goes<br>
    completely dark.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Damn!<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Haven't they invented electric<br>
    lights by now?</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    What, dear fellow?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Watson, please!<br>
    (to Lestrade)<br>
    Pray go on, Inspector.</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Well, to put the matter simply,<br>
    Holmes, this man was accosted by<br>
    gypsies bent on depriving him of<br>
    his most valuable possessions...<br>
    and, in the process of picking<br>
    his pockets clean, the gypsies<br>
    also happened to bag a photograph<br>
    this man was carrying --</p>
  <p> Data reaches for the lapel of the Man's overcoat, and<br>
    RIPS it down, tearing it from top to bottom... and,<br>
    from inside the lining of the coat's hem, Data<br>
    withdraws a photograph!... which he hands to a<br>
    surprised Lestrade...</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Great Scott! It's the photograph!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>11A CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe, Inspector, that you<br>
    will find that this emissary here<br>
    works not for but against the King<br>
    of Bohemia, and that photograph<br>
    of the king and his ex-mistress<br>
    is to be used as blackmail.<br>
    Further, upon deeper reflection,<br>
    you will deduce, as did I, that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (in disgust)<br>
    Computer, freeze program. Exit!</p>
  <p> A set of Holodeck exit doors appears, parting TO REVEAL<br>
    the interior corridor of the Enterprise... the Holodeck<br>
    characters freeze. Geordi strides toward the exit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Where are you going?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm done.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I was just about to reveal<br>
    that the &quot;sir&quot; is in fact a<br>
    &quot;madame,&quot; and that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Forget it, Data.</p>
  <p> And Geordi strides out... Data puzzles over matters<br>
    for a beat, and then he follows. The Holodeck doors<br>
    close behind them.</p>
  <p>12 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are sitting at a table near the<br>
    windows. The Enterprise is not moving.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What was the point to going onto<br>
    the Holodeck?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    To solve a Sherlock Holmes<br>
    mystery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Exactly, but, you've got them all<br>
    memorized. The first time someone<br>
    opens their mouth, you've got it<br>
    solved. So, there's really no<br>
    mystery. If there's no mystery...<br>
    there's no game... no game...<br>
    no fun.</p>
  <p> Geordi feels like he is being too emphatic.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'm not angry with you, Data,<br>
    really... It's just that... we<br>
    go to all the trouble to arrange<br>
    time to come down to the Holodeck,<br>
    to get the proper wardrobe, to<br>
    get into character, and, boom,<br>
    it barely gets started and you<br>
    jump to the end. See, I was<br>
    looking forward to the chase.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then I should have extended the<br>
    sequence of events.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not getting through. The fun<br>
    of the program is the attempt to<br>
    solve a mystery.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is exactly what we were<br>
    doing.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (O.S.)<br>
    You are wasting your breath,<br>
    Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> And, from behind, DOCTOR PULASKI'S VOICE:</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi look around to find PULASKI sitting<br>
    there, facing the opposite direction.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Saying that to Data is asking a<br>
    computer not to compute.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Am I so different from you,<br>
    Doctor? Can you cease thinking<br>
    on command?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In medicine I face many puzzles<br>
    to which I do not know the answer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She's right, Data. You always<br>
    know the answer.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    To feel the thrill of a victory...<br>
    there must be the possibility of<br>
    failure.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Where's the victory winning a<br>
    battle you can't possibly lose?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you suggesting that there is<br>
    some value in losing?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (enthusiastic))<br>
    Yes. That's the great teacher.<br>
    We humans often learn more from<br>
    a mistake or a failure than we<br>
    do from an easy success. But not<br>
    you -- all your learning is by<br>
    rote. To you it's all<br>
    memorization and recitation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know about that.<br>
    Deductive reasoning is Data's<br>
    strength.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes, Holmes as well, but Holmes<br>
    also understood the human soul.<br>
    Those dark flecks which drive<br>
    us... which turn the innocent to<br>
    the evil. That understanding is<br>
    beyond Data. It comes from &quot;life&quot;<br>
    experience -- which he doesn't have<br>
    -- combined with human intuition<br>
    for which he cannot be programmed.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I disagree -- totally.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    His victory at playing Sherlock<br>
    Holmes is just a blind mimicry,<br>
    a collection of bits and bytes<br>
    of information without any true<br>
    understanding.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're being unfair.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't think so, Lieutenant.<br>
    Your artificial friend wouldn't<br>
    have a prayer of solving a Holmes<br>
    mystery which he hasn't read.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have read them all.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe the computer could create<br>
    one in the style of Holmes...<br>
    where you wouldn't know the<br>
    outcome.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Like I said, he wouldn't have a<br>
    prayer.</p>

    There are STREET VENDORS, PENNY POSTMEN, BOBBIES,<br>
    STREET URCHINS begging for tuppence, BARRISTERS in<br>

    First time on one with this level<br>
    of sophistication. Now how does<br>
    this work? The real London was<br>
    over a hundred square miles in<br>
    size.</p>
  <p> Data starts walking along the block, and Geordi and<br>
    Pulaski follow closely, as:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is no larger than the<br>
    Holodeck, of course. So the<br>
    computer adjusts by placing images<br>
    of more distant perspectives on<br>
    the Holodeck walls...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But with the image so perfect<br>
    you'd have to touch the wall to<br>
    know it was there. And the<br>
    computer fools you in other ways.<br>
    (Watson's accent)<br>
    I say, Holmes, where shall we head<br>
    -- the theatre? Rule's? Or<br>
    perhaps a concert?</p>
  <p> Data stops walking, likewise freezing Geordi and<br>
    Pulaski... and Data pulls out his pipe, methodically<br>
    scans the scene, trying to determine their next move.<br>
    SUDDENLY a YOUTH sprints out of the shadows carrying<br>
    a sack and running for all he's worth. The Pie Man<br>
    screams.</p>
  <p> PIE MAN<br>
    Stop him. He stole my goods...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to intercept the youth.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. It is a ruse. This way.</p>
  <p> We FOLLOW Data's gesture to see a rather nondescript<br>
    building by an alley -- a brass plaque on the building<br>
    is unreadable at this distance... Now Data quickly<br>
    crosses, with Geordi and Pulaski right on his heels.</p>

  <p> They have reached the building -- and Data is squinting<br>
    up at a rope which is dangling from a vent in the<br>
    ceiling over the stoop, just by the front door...</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Hear that? What do those<br>
    footfalls tell you, Watson?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That we're on the right track?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    More particularly, that our<br>
    opposition does indeed consist<br>
    of two men... that one of them<br>
    is carrying the bound and gagged<br>
    Doctor Pulaski. We must hurry --</p>
  <p> Data scoots down the alley once more, Geordi in tow,<br>
    as:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know all this because you read<br>
    it in a Holmes story, right?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at all... Since we do not hear<br>
    the doctor's footfalls, we must<br>
    presume she is being carried, and<br>
    since we do not hear her calling<br>
    for help, we know she is gagged.<br>
    Further... both sets of footfalls<br>
    are heavy and masculine -- one man<br>
    seems to shuffle and stumble in<br>
    an irregular pattern... Since the<br>
    ground is level, I must conclude<br>
    that Doctor Pulaski is struggling<br>
    against her captor, sporadically<br>
    knocking him off stride. It is<br>
    deduction, pure and simple...<br>
    well, perhaps not that simple.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are just rounding the only sharp bend<br>
    in the alleyway, and the RUNNING FOOTSTEPS AHEAD ARE<br>
    LOUD AND VERY NEAR...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Here we go, Watson -- I daresay<br>
    we have caught up rather nicely<br>
    with our quarry --</p>
  <p> And Data and Geordi zoom out of the bend... and come<br>
    to a stop as they find themselves face to face with<br>
    a dead-end brick wall... There's no sign of anyone else<br>
    there, no doors, no manholes, no way out except back<br>
    the way they came...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There should be a doorway.</p>
  <p> Data turns and heads back up the alley...</p>
  <p>31 LONDON STREET - ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE</p>
  <p> as Data and Geordi wander out of the alley and along<br>
    the street. Across from them is a warehouse.</p>
  <p> Lestrade rushes up:</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Holmes, thank God you're here.</p>
  <p> Lestrade grabs Data's arm, steers him -- with Geordi<br>
    following -- to:</p>
  <p>32 LONDON STREET</p>
  <p> where a CROWD has gathered in a circle to look at<br>
    something on the ground...</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Make way, please, make way, make<br>
    way for Mr. Sherlock Holmes...</p>
  <p> The crowd parts... and Lestrade, Data, and Geordi push<br>
    through to find the object of interest --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p>33 LYING ON THE GROUND -- THE BODY</p>
  <p> of a middle-aged, common-looking man... Now the feet<br>
    of Data, Geordi, and Lestrade step INTO FRAME, around<br>
    the body, as:</p>
  <p> LESTRADE (O.S.)<br>
    It's murder, Holmes, murder most<br>
    foul.</p>
  <p> Lestrade, Data, and Geordi stoop down for closer<br>
    inspection of the body, and all are now IN FRAME, as:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Well, Holmes, let's hear it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is nothing here of<br>
    relevance. I do not see how this<br>
    connects with the disappearance<br>
    of the doctor.</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Doctor? Doctor Watson is standing<br>
    right here, Holmes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor Kate Pulaski. But do not<br>
    concern yourself, Inspector. You<br>
    have enough on your mind.</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    She was with you?</p>
  <p>34 NEW ANGLE - DATA, GEORDI, LESTRADE, AND BODY</p>
  <p> Both Geordi and Data are enthralled by this game.<br>
    Geordi returns to his role as the counterfeit Watson.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Inspector, perhaps I can be of<br>
    assistance... As I take note of<br>
    this dead man, I deduce that he<br>
    was strangled.</p>
  <p> Geordi's moment in the sun:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The finger marks on his throat<br>
    indicate the cause of death, and,<br>
    since there are signs of a<br>
    struggle, it's obvious that his<br>
    killer was a stranger, who caught<br>
    him from behind.</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Is that correct, Holmes?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. Look at his shoes. He's more<br>
    a convict -- released just today<br>
    from Dartmoor prison... He spent<br>
    the day in a tavern where he<br>
    consumed large quantities of gin<br>
    -- with his killer, who followed<br>
    him to this spot -- and waited over<br>
    there until the victim slipped<br>
    into a drunken stupor, then out<br>
    of fear, motivated only by<br>
    self-protection strangled him.</p>
  <p> Data indicates a WOMAN in the crowd.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    There is your killer, Inspector.</p>
  <p> She starts to run but is grabbed by a BOBBY, who brings<br>
    her forward.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And when you check, I believe you<br>
    will find this poor soul is the<br>
    victim's common law wife, who has<br>
    been dreading his release because<br>
    he was a vile and abusive man.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But, Holmes she doesn't have the<br>
    strength of strangling him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not with her hands -- no. But with<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> Data reaches over and takes a beaded scarf from around<br>
    the woman's neck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When used as a garrote, these<br>
    beads will leave marks quite<br>
    similar to fingerprints, except,<br>
    my dear Watson... the marks on<br>
    the victim are too evenly spaced<br>
    to be caused by human hands.</p>
  <p> LESTRADE<br>
    Astounding, Holmes... absolutely<br>
    astounding.</p>
  <p> Data is uninterested in the compliment or further<br>
    discussion of this crime; he turns and scans the<br>
    street.</p>
  <p>35 LONDON STREET - DATA'S POV</p>
  <p> He notices a tall man (Moriarty) entering a warehouse.</p>
  <p>36 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Data has lost interest in the murder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Inspector -- for reasons strictly<br>
    personal -- I must leave. Come,<br>
    Watson, this murder is not<br>
    connected with our case.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (excitedly)<br>
    If this murder isn't connected<br>
    to the disappearance of Doctor<br>
    Pulaski, then the computer is<br>
    running an independent program.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> DATA)<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    I do not know... and that troubles<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then you don't know what's coming<br>
    next?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (still enjoying the<br>
    game)<br>
    That's what I wanted to hear.</p>
  <p>37 LONDON STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi leave the scene of the crime as a<br>
    pushcart arrives to carry off the corpse and the bobby<br>
    and Lestrade lead the woman away.</p>
  <p>38 ENTRANCE TO THE WAREHOUSE</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi approach. There are a couple of<br>
    drunken SEAMEN staggering along the sidewalk. Nearby<br>
    is a very dangerous looking THUG, beyond whom is a<br>
    vibrantly painted WHORE. A THUG comes up and grabs<br>
    Data's coat.</p>
  <p> THUG<br>
    Do you have some coppers for a<br>
    hungry man?</p>
  <p> WHORE<br>
    I'll give you some value for your<br>
    copper, mate...</p>
  <p> There is an air of violence about this beggar.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Allow us to pass.</p>
  <p> THUG<br>
    Give it up.</p>
  <p> WHORE<br>
    Ain't no men left in London.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Release my coat or I will be<br>
    forced to give you a severe<br>
    thrashing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As the thug backs off, he bumps into Geordi, then<br>
    pushes him aside and leaves.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's getting a little rough.<br>
    Where to, now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We will find Doctor Pulaski<br>
    inside.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How do you know that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is the only obvious choice.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Why, all of a sudden would the<br>
    obvious choice be the correct<br>
    choice? Isn't this a game of<br>
    misdirection?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not any more. He wants us to find<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who does?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The master criminal. The man<br>
    Holmes could only defeat at the<br>
    cost of his own life at<br>
    Reichenbach falls - our adversary,<br>
    my dear Watson is none other than<br>
    Professor Moriarty himself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Great -- now this is really<br>
    getting good.</p>
  <p> Data pushes open the door. Geordi follows him through.</p>
  <p>39 INT. WAREHOUSE</p>
  <p> is long, narrow and crammed full of barrels and crates.<br>
    Data leads them down an aisle following a set of wet<br>
    footprints.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's nothing in here but these<br>
    barrels.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... and a trail.<br>
    (indicating the tracks<br>
    in the dust)<br>
    Which is so well marked, that<br>
    obviously we are meant to follow<br>
    it.</p>
  <p>40 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As the aisle ends against a blank wall.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Another dead end.</p>
  <p> Data runs his finger along a seam in wooden wall.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No Watson, not a dead end at all.<br>
    Here -- can you see these<br>
    scratches?</p>
  <p> Data pushes against the wall just to the left of the<br>
    little scratches and the wall slides open to reveal<br>
    another room.</p>
  <p>41 INT. MORIARTY'S LAIR - TIGHT ANGLE - PANNING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A windowless, doorless room, full of Victorian finery<br>
    and bric-a-brac... A lab table and boxes full of<br>
    bizarre tools, equipment, wires... And we:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The doctor was right, now we have<br>
    a game worth playing.</p>
  <p> the VOICE of Moriarty, mellifluous and evil:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    The time for games is over.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Professor Moriarty, I presume?</p>
  <p> And Moriarty, tall, angular, in long frock appears from<br>
    the side. Geordi turns to Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How did you know that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is the one worthy opponent<br>
    created by the author, Conan<br>
    Doyle.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    And, like the spider, I feel the<br>
    strings vibrate whenever anyone<br>
    new chances into my web. Welcome,<br>
    my dear Holmes -- but not<br>
    Holmes... and Doctor Watson...<br>
    but not Watson.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (slightly concerned)<br>
    What's he mean? How would he know<br>
    we're not who we appear to be?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Where is Doctor Pulaski?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    She's here.</p>
  <p> But we don't see her.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She would not have answered any<br>
    questions.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (a wicked smile)<br>
    She has provided many answers.<br>
    Do you forget I have always been<br>
    your equal, dear Holmes? I have<br>
    read her expressions -- what she<br>
    has not said is as important as<br>
    her words...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (interrupts)<br>
    Have you injured her?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I will if necessary, Holmes. But<br>
    my mind is crowded with images.<br>
    Thoughts I do not understand yet<br>
    cannot purge. They plague me.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY (Cont'd)<br>
    You -- and your associate -- look<br>
    and act so oddly, yet though I<br>
    have never met nor seen the like<br>
    of either of you... I am familiar<br>
    with you both. It's very<br>
    confusing.</p>
  <p> Data does not respond.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I have felt new realities at the<br>
    edge of my consciousness, readying<br>
    to break through... Surely,<br>
    Holmes, if that's who you truly<br>
    are -- you of all people can<br>
    appreciate what I mean.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Say nothing!</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I know there is a great power<br>
    called Computer, wiser than the<br>
    oracle at Delphi. A power which<br>
    controls<br>
    (he waves his hand to<br>
    encompass everything)<br>
    ... all of this, and to which we<br>
    can speak. Arch!</p>
  <p> And to the amazement of Data and Geordi, the computer<br>
    arch APPEARS.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This isn't right, Data. How can<br>
    a holographic image call for the<br>
    arch?</p>
  <p> Data looks from the arch to Moriarty as his brain<br>
    tries to sort it out. Moriarty takes a piece of paper<br>
    from the pad beside his desk and quickly sketches a<br>
    simple outline on the paper.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (in a rush of words)<br>
    It has described a great monstrous<br>
    shape on which I am like a fly<br>
    -- stuck on a turtle's back -- adrift<br>
    in a great emptiness.</p>
  <p> He gives the paper to Data, with:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is this, Holmes?</p>
  <p> Data stares in shock at the drawing which neither we<br>
    nor Geordi can see. Then, abruptly, paper still in<br>
    hand, he turns...</p>
  <p>42 INT. WAREHOUSE</p>
  <p> As Data -- followed by Geordi -- hurries through the<br>
    warehouse toward the door.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Tell me -- stop and tell me, man!</p>
  <p> Data glances back, but doesn't break stride.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data! What's going on?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We must leave.</p>
  <p> Geordi is a few paces behind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's on the paper?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (calling after them)<br>
    Why does it frighten you, Holmes?</p>
  <p>43 LONDON STREET</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi come out of the warehouse. The<br>
    characters who have been inhabiting the street are more<br>
    aggressive now than they have been. Data and Geordi<br>
    are pulled at by TWO WHORES -- by a COUPLE OF BEGGARS<br>
    -- who demand money and physically attempt to impede<br>
    them. Data uses his hands to move a legless Beggar<br>
    out of his way. The Fellini-like scene goes on.</p>

    Why can't you shut down the<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    This.</p>
  <p> He shows Geordi the paper. It's a sketch of the USS<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This isn't possible. How could<br>
    a character from 1890 London be<br>

  <p> as it holds in position.</p>
  <p>47 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> PICARD has assembled his staff -- TROI, RIKER, WORF,<br>
    Data, and Geordi (the latter two still in Victorian<br>
    costume) -- he is holding Moriarty's sketch of the<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me again -- exactly what<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor Pulaski and I had a<br>
    discussion about whether Data<br>
    could solve an original<br>
    Holmes-type mystery.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And you asked the computer to<br>
    provide one.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes... with a worthy opponent.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worthy of Holmes?</p>
  <p> The realization comes to Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Oh, my God. I asked for a<br>
    Sherlock Holmes-type mystery with<br>
    an opponent capable of defeating<br>
    Data. That must be it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (in French)<br>
    Terrible!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain... I'm sorry...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand, Lieutenant. Well,<br>
    at least now we have part of an<br>
    explanation. The computer is not<br>
    trying to confound &quot;Holmes,&quot; which<br>
    would be relatively easy, it has<br>
    been ordered to create an<br>
    adversary to defeat Data.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... I got carried away...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's past. Data, this character<br>
    Moriarty... you said he called<br>
    for the arch...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So he is able to access the<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And perhaps also our library<br>
    files. That level of information<br>
    would be necessary in order to<br>
    create a true adversary for me.</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Theorize, Data. What are his<br>
    limits?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is still a fictional character,<br>
    originally programmed with<br>
    nineteenth century knowledge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But with access now to the<br>
    twenty-fourth century.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What does he need to begin making<br>
    use of that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Only time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I can lead a security team<br>
    to sweep the Holodeck, find the<br>
    Doctor, and bring her out.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I believe that would<br>
    place the doctor at risk. It is<br>
    probable that the mortality<br>
    failsafe has been overridden.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, locate Doctor Pulaski.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor Troi, have you a sense<br>
    of our opponent?</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It is difficult for me to separate<br>
    a single individual from all the<br>
    disorder I feel down there.<br>
    Captain, what is unusual about<br>
    this is that I should not be able<br>
    to sense a holographic projection<br>
    at all -- yet I do.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, recommend we try to<br>
    destroy the hologram-generations<br>
    themselves. Is that possible,<br>
    Geordi?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Using wave guides, I could split<br>
    a particle stream out of the<br>
    matter/antimatter chamber and<br>
    route it down through existing<br>
    conduit into the Holodeck -- if<br>
    it is accelerated to sufficient<br>
    velocity that will quite literally<br>
    wash away all the present<br>
    holographic constructs -- the<br>
    London buildings, the streets,<br>
    the people, all gone... including<br>
    Moriarty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And Doctor Pulaski?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The particle stream will tear<br>
    apart human flesh as well, that<br>
    option is not acceptable.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, I am suddenly sensing<br>
    more order to the energy on the<br>
    Holodeck -- as if one unifying<br>
    force, one consciousness, is<br>
    trying to bring it all into focus.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, there is only one thing<br>
    which can explain this. In<br>
    programming Moriarty to defeat<br>
    me, not Holmes, he had to be able<br>
    to acquire something which I possess.</p>

  <p>47 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly what?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Consciousness. He cannot defeat<br>
    me without it.</p>

    Then stops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer -- what happened?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Attitude and stabilization control<br>
    of the Enterprise was momentarily<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data -- I think it's best if you<br>
    and I returned to the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will change into my uniform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No -- I'll change into an<br>
    appropriate costume. It seems<br>
    he feeds on knowledge. Let's not<br>
    give your nemesis any more<br>
    information than we have to.</p>
  <p>48 INT. MORIARTY'S LAIR - TIGHT ANGLE - PANNING</p>
  <p> A windowless, doorless room, full of Victorian finery<br>
    and bric-a-brac... A blackboard covered with equations<br>
    surrounding a sketch of the Enterprise... A lab table<br>
    and boxes full of bizarre tools, equipment, wires...<br>
    And we:</p>
  <p> Moriarty is standing there by what is now an assembled<br>
    heap of odd machinery -- gears and belts and pistons<br>
    and coils... a boiler and an upright exhaust pipe...<br>
    riveted ironbrass plates for a covering... a large<br>
    clutch lever and a mechanical arrow indicator for<br>
    &quot;ENGAGE/DISENGAGE&quot; (currently set to the latter). He<br>
    steps away from the machine, and crosses the little<br>

    I am not sure.</p>
  <p>49 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moriarty approaches the table, and pours a cup of tea<br>
    for Doctor Pulaski. Pulaski has guessed that something<br>
    is out of whack and her best course of action is to<br>
    provide as little info as possible.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Now, dear lady, will that be one<br>
    lump or two?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Lumps, Professor? What sort of<br>
    lumps?</p>
  <p> He drops two into her cup of tea... and now he lifts<br>
    the creamer:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Milk, of course?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (beat; then)<br>
    Why not.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Mister Computer proposes the<br>
    incredible thought that we are<br>
    all traveling in a great vessel<br>
    of some sort.</p>
  <p> Moriarty pours the milk into Pulaski's cup... and he<br>
    gently slides her cup and saucer to her...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... Is that true?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I don't know what you are talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    The scones are likewise a must.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He slides her the tray of biscuits, muffins, and pastry<br>
    -- she stares at everything, finally lifts the tea to<br>
    her lips and gives it the merest taste as he watches<br>
    expectantly... And:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Uh, it's really quite excellent.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    Strange. It actually pleases me<br>
    to hear you say that.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Very strange. You're beginning<br>
    to sound quite different from the<br>
    Moriarty I've read about.</p>
  <p> Moriarty smiles, takes a bite out of a pastry... And:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    You're not frightened of me?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    You should be.<br>

    please.</p>
  <p> And the arch and exit MATERIALIZE out of the near wall.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    A few more questions, Mister<br>
    Computer.</p>
  <p> Stunned, Pulaski watches as Moriarty types very rapidly<br>
    in two-finger style. Then after a bit, while still<br>
    typing:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I just can't seem to remember that<br>
    last command... Ah, well, sooner<br>
    or later it'll all come to me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Then he hits one more button, and the arch<br>
    DEMATERIALIZES... And now Moriarty stands, strolls to<br>
    his lab equipment, putters among it, picking up pieces<br>
    here and there, turning them, staring at them from<br>
    various angles, as:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But, in the meantime, I've decided<br>
    to approach the problem from a<br>
    more familiar perspective.<br>
    There's really no reason I<br>
    shouldn't be able to use some of<br>
    the knowledge from my world in<br>
    order to bring me closer to yours.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I have no idea what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Of course you do, Madam. The more<br>
    you proclaim your ignorance, the<br>
    more you attempt to mislead me,<br>
    the more I am on to you -- your<br>
    every silence speaks volumes.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Good, then if you know what I'm<br>
    saying when I'm not saying<br>
    anything, what do you need me<br>
    around for?<br>
    (stands)<br>
    Thanks for the tea and crumpets,<br>
    but I guess I'll be going.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Where? Back to here?</p>
  <p> Moriarty jabs his finger against his blackboard drawing<br>
    of the Enterprise --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes, would you care to join me?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>

    Or is this where we both are right<br>
    now?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Right now we are in London. Tell<br>
    me what you want from me, or allow<br>
    me to leave.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Frankly, now, I want nothing more<br>
    than what the fisherman expects<br>
    of the worm... You, dear Doctor,<br>
    will be the lure... and this will<br>
    be the hook --<br>

    This is the first time I get to<br>
    see you in action.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I hope you're not disappointed.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm sure I won't be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You two have gotten awfully...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    ... chummy? Yes, this time<br>
    together has been quite pleasant.<br>
    I am a civilized abductor, Captain<br>
    Picard. Civilized but still<br>
    dangerous.</p>
  <p> Moriarty slams the handle of the machine into the<br>
    &quot;ENGAGE&quot; position. The room ROCKS.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>58A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Here, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Status. Has anything changed?</p>
  <p> Worf looks the particle device over, responds:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p>59 INT. MORIARTY'S LAIR</p>
  <p> SHAKING HAS STOPPED.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Moriarty, you were conjured up<br>
    to attempt to defeat Holmes<br>
    here... and once that attempt is<br>
    concluded -- win or lose -- your<br>
    program has run its course, your<br>
    existence is done.</p>
  <p> Picard nods at Data... and Data who nods:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Congratulations, Professor<br>
    Moriarty, I capitulate to the<br>
    better man -- your victory is well<br>
    earned.</p>
  <p> Data steps toward Moriarty, his hand outstretched to<br>
    shake the professor's... but Moriarty pulls away.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    It's gone beyond that little game,<br>
    Mister Data. And you'll note I<br>
    no longer call you Holmes.<br>
    Whatever I was when this began,<br>
    I have grown. I am understanding<br>
    more and more. And I am able to<br>
    use the power at my fingertips.</p>
  <p> Again, he throws the lever. The room ROCKS.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I can affect this... this vessel,<br>
    if that's where we are. I can<br>
    also inflict bodily harm on you<br>
    -- or on your doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes -- I know that, Moriarty, but<br>
    you haven't. You shook this ship<br>
    because you wanted to get my<br>
    attention -- you have it. So what<br>
    is it you want?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    The same thing you want for<br>
    yourself. To continue to exist.<br>
    If I destroy these surroundings,<br>
    this vessel, can you say it<br>
    doesn't matter to you?<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Interesting pun, don't you agree,<br>
    for matter is what I am not. The<br>
    computer has taught me that I<br>
    am made up only of energy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That... may not be completely<br>
    true, Professor. This... which<br>
    we call our &quot;Holodeck&quot; makes use<br>
    of the same principle in another<br>
    of our devices called a<br>
    &quot;transporter.&quot; By the year in<br>
    which we live, humans have<br>
    discovered that matter and energy<br>
    are interchangeable. On this<br>
    Holodeck energy has been converted<br>
    to matter and thus you have<br>
    substance, but only here.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    And if I step off this Holodeck?</p>
  <p> Everyone hesitates over what the real answer to this<br>
    is. Then:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You would cease to be.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You are not alive, Moriarty, as<br>
    I said you are only...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    A holographic image, I know. But<br>
    are you sure?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (indicating Data)<br>
    Does he have life?<br>
    (pause)<br>
    He's a machine -- but is that all<br>
    he is?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. He is more.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Exactly.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Is the definition of life &quot;cogito<br>
    ergo sum&quot;? I think, therefore<br>
    I am.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's one possible definition.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    It is the most important one and<br>
    for me -- the only one that<br>
    matters. You -- or someone -- asked<br>
    your computer to program a<br>
    nefarious fictional character from<br>
    nineteenth century London -- and<br>
    that is how I arrived... but I<br>
    am no longer that creation. I<br>
    am no longer that evil character,<br>
    I have changed. I am alive -- I<br>
    am aware of my own consciousness.</p>
  <p> Moriarty throws Pulaski an almost tender look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm responsible for the safety<br>
    of this vessel and crew.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I want my existence.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    I want it out there just as you<br>
    have yours.</p>
  <p> Picard exchanges looks with his associates, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gently)<br>
    That may not be possible.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Then you must do murder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I cannot give you what you want.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Because you do not yet know how<br>
    to convert Holodeck matter into<br>
    a more permanent form.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is true --</p>
  <p> Moriarty holds Picard with a long look.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    A pity. What I have seen -- what<br>
    I have learned, fascinates me.<br>
    I do not want to die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I do not want to kill you.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    Madam, I have enjoyed your<br>
    company.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's been different.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (calls)<br>
    Computer! &quot;Arch.&quot;</p>
  <p> The arch APPEARS.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Cancel override protocol, return<br>
    control of the Holodeck to main<br>
    computer. My fate is in your<br>
    hands, as perhaps it always was.</p>
  <p> A long beat, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bridge, this is the Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    This is the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, the situation is under<br>
    control.</p>

    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor Moriarty, this ship has<br>
    vast, library memory capacity.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    How well I know...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will save this program of you.<br>
    You will not be extinguished.<br>
    We will save every aspect of you<br>
    that exists now. And I promise<br>
    you we will try to discover a<br>
    way to bring you back in a form<br>
    capable of leaving the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> Moriarty looks toward Pulaski who is nodding rapidly<br>
    as if to say &quot;trust him.&quot;</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    Then perhaps we'll meet again<br>
    some day, Madam.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It may take many years. Time<br>
    won't pass for you, but I may be<br>
    an old woman.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>62A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    But I'll still fill you with<br>
    crumpets, Madam.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I detest long good-byes.<br>
    (indicates)<br>
    You have the arch.</p>
  <p>62B ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Picard eyes the arch and then Moriarty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As you wish. A short good-bye.<br>
    (toward arch)<br>
    Computer, save this program...<br>
    then discontinue it for now.</p>
  <p> A beat, then MORIARTY AND THE ENTIRE ROOM FADE AWAY.<br>
    The three are standing on the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Right up to the end, he never<br>
    knew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. He didn't.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Know. Know what?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That he could leave the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    But that's not possible.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know how, but for<br>
    Moriarty it was.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Then you lied when you told him<br>
    he couldn't leave the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Elementary... &quot; - 10/12/88 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>62B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, what the captain said was that<br>
    we do not know how to convert<br>
    Holodeck matter into a more<br>
    permanent form. Which is true.<br>
    Even after we review this program,<br>
    we still may not have the answer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, even with all his<br>
    assurances -- that character was<br>
    still Professor Moriarty. I will<br>
    need to know a lot more about him<br>
    before I allow him loose on my<br>
    ship; he has, after all, made his<br>
    reputation through cunning and<br>
    deceit.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    But how do you know he could leave<br>
    the Holodeck?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Data reaches into his coat pocket and removes the paper<br>
    on which Moriarty first drew the sketch of the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The drawing?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. The paper. This piece of<br>
    paper was created as part of the<br>
    Holodeck illusion. If it could<br>
    leave the Holodeck, so too could<br>
    Moriarty.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm impressed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is elementary, my dear<br>
    Doctor... It is elementary.</p>

    the Victory model. He crosses to where Geordi is<br>
    examining the model. Geordi has lost some of his<br>
    normal buoyancy, because he is feeling responsible for<br>
    what has happened. Picard watches him for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damaged?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes. A spar was cracked when the<br>
    Enterprise was shaken. Otherwise<br>
    she seemed to have weathered it<br>
    nicely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She's beautifully turned out,<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes -- it's just that I can't help<br>
    thinking how badly it could have<br>
    been damaged all because I<br>
    misspoke a word.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
