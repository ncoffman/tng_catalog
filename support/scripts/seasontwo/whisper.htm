  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship glides through space, planets and stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42411.2.<br>
    The Enterprise has been<br>
    unexpectedly diverted to the<br>
    Ramatis star system. The two<br>
    sides of a bitter little planetary<br>
    conflict have petitioned Starfleet<br>
    to transport to their world a<br>
    mediator they have mutually<br>
    selected. Our orders are<br>
    transportation only -- no<br>
    interference, no responsibilities.<br>
    It is a mission much to my<br>
    liking.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER has the Command position. WESLEY has the Conn,<br>
    DATA is at Ops, n.d. CREWMEMBER at Tactical. The other<br>
    positions are occupied by n.d. crewmembers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Reduce to half impulse.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Reducing velocity to one-half<br>
    impulse.</p>
  <p> Riker walks to the captain's Ready Room door.</p>
  <p> The CHIME signals Riker's presence. From inside,<br>
    CAPTAIN PICARD calls out.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker enters. Spread across and above Picard's desk is<br>
    a complicated arrangement of three-dimensional shapes -- some<br>
    on the surface, others seemingly suspended in<br>
    air.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, Number One. Look at this.<br>
    Ever since we left the Lima-Sierra<br>
    system, I have been puzzling over<br>
    how the third planet could<br>
    maintain such an orbit, when it<br>
    is theoretically impossible, but<br>
    consider this.</p>
  <p> Riker moves closer, whereupon Picard activates the<br>
    display. The shapes GO INTO MOTION. They then STOP.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's no degeneration?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I haven't got that worked out.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Perhaps this facsimile lacks mass.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, somewhat, but if this is an<br>
    accurate representation -- would<br>
    it not explain what happened in<br>
    that system?</p>
  <p> Riker moves closer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (as he studies the<br>
    display)<br>
    Perhaps.</p>
  <p> Picard comes back to business.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, not a matter of great moment -- just<br>
    a knot I had to untie.<br>
    Now... What was it you wanted to<br>
    see me about?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, we have arrived at<br>
    Ramatis Three.</p>
  <p> Picard gets to his feet as he speaks:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah -- well -- time to leave.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> entering orbit near the silver and blue planet of<br>
    Ramatis Three.</p>
  <p>5 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as before. Picard and Riker come onto the bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Standard orbit, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Standard orbit.</p>
  <p> Together they head for the turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, you have the bridge.</p>
  <p> Data leaves Ops and is immediately replaced by an n.d.<br>
    FEMALE CREWMEMBER. He takes the Command position.</p>
  <p>6 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Riker and Picard enter the turbolift, the doors<br>
    close.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am still uncomfortable about<br>
    your leading this away team.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is not an away team in the<br>
    strictest sense. I consider this<br>
    more of a ceremonial function.<br>
    For me not to go, could be<br>
    construed a lack of respect, or<br>
    that I do not regard the mission<br>
    as significant. Transporter Room<br>
    Five.</p>
  <p> The turbolift heads for Deck Seventeen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Considering the importance of this<br>
    mission and the lives which are<br>
    at stake... I don't want to do<br>
    anything which would have a<br>
    negative affect on this<br>
    negotiation, however...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I appreciate your concern, Number<br>
    One, but, I'm sure it will go<br>
    quite smoothly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have come a great distance for<br>
    this mediator.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They asked for the best and that<br>
    person, from all reports, is Riva.</p>
  <p> The turbolift arrives. Riker and Picard step off.</p>
  <p>7A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they walk along.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've never heard of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not surprised, he hasn't<br>
    mediated for several decades.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's a long time to be out of<br>
    the saddle. Let's hope he's not<br>
    rusty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, for all our sakes... let's<br>
    hope Riva is at the top of his<br>
    game.</p>
  <p> They turn and enter the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> TROI and WORF are waiting. They step onto the<br>
    platform.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF<br>
    Coordinates have been input.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good, Lieutenant. Worry not,<br>
    Number One -- this will be a simple<br>
    ceremonial greeting, and right<br>
    back to the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> And the away team -- with Picard as their leader -- VANISHES.</p>
  <p>9 INT. RAMATIS - ANTEROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the away team STACKS UP.</p>
  <p>10 ANOTHER ANGLE - INT. RAMATIS - ANTEROOM</p>
  <p> A handsome BOY greets the away team, and motions for<br>
    them to follow him.</p>
  <p>11 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they reach a vestibule which leads to a larger room.<br>
    The boy leads them toward a larger room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>12 INT. LARGER ROOM</p>
  <p> They enter. There is no one in the room. At the far<br>
    end is a raised dais. The design of the room is<br>
    geometric -- the decorations eclectic. As the away team<br>
    looks around, they realize their young guide has<br>
    disappeared and they are all alone:</p>
  <p> Off their reactions:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the planet Ramatis.</p>
  <p>14 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker once again has the Command position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, this is the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have arrived safely, Number<br>
    One, and for the most part, we've<br>
    been ignored... ah...</p>
  <p>15<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    16</p>
  <p>17 INT. RAMATIS - LARGER ROOM</p>
  <p> The away team in the larger room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... some of the local citizenry<br>
    are beginning to assemble. I'll<br>
    keep you informed.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    I would appreciate it.</p>
  <p>18 ANOTHER ANGLE - LARGER ROOM</p>
  <p> Slowly, without any apparent signal, HUMANOIDS begin to<br>
    casually assemble. They enter the room from portals,<br>
    scattered along the walls, talking quietly among<br>
    themselves in an unrecognizable, and mostly unheard,<br>
    language.</p>
  <p>19 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> There are three of them... each a distinctive<br>
    personality and physical archetype -- the<br>
    SCHOLAR/ARTIST, the WARRIOR/ADONIS, a CULTURED WOMAN.<br>
    These &quot;types&quot; show no emotion, and if they are aware of<br>
    the away team, they do not acknowledge them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>20 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> a MAN enters from behind the away team. By his dress,<br>
    his carriage and his presence he is someone in<br>
    authority. This is RIVA -- he appears to be around<br>
    thirty earth years, pleasant looking, with an open<br>
    friendly countenance.</p>
  <p>21 PICARD AND TROI</p>
  <p> as Riva passes them. He pauses, studying first Picard -- his<br>
    appraisal is open, his gaze penetrating. Because<br>
    of his vast experience in different and unusual<br>
    situations, Picard has the wisdom to wait for Riva to<br>
    make the first move. Riva then turns his attention<br>
    on Worf, then to Troi, then leaves her with a warm<br>
    flirtatious smile.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (she responds with a<br>
    smile, and a nod)<br>
    Riva.</p>
  <p>22 ANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM</p>
  <p> Riva walks onto the dais, those he passes offer a<br>
    greeting.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    eeennniYOO.</p>
  <p> It is obviously a term of respect as well as a<br>
    greeting. Riva responds with a slight wave of his<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is a well-liked leader. Their<br>
    affection is genuine, as is his.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, if they respect him on<br>
    Solais, as much as they do here -- we<br>
    could be looking forward to<br>
    a successful mission.</p>
  <p>23 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riva takes his place on the dais, the CHORUS gathers in<br>
    front of him. Riva pauses, comfortable -- relaxed -- very<br>
    pleasant. His expression is bemused -- as though<br>
    he is expecting good news.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've never seen anything like this<br>
    before and I'm a little uncertain<br>
    about how to proceed.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    There is a wonderful feeling of<br>
    well being, emanating from here.</p>
  <p> The man on the dais, makes a very slight motion --<br>
    (through all this the Chorus never turns to face Riva.<br>
    Their method of communication we do not understand and<br>
    will never understand. It is part of their long<br>
    history.)</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Please -- come closer.</p>
  <p> The away team takes a couple of steps closer.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Before I start, is there anything<br>
    you need? Refreshments, food.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. But thank you for asking.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Then --<br>
    (with a gesture to<br>
    Picard)<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates - then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Greetings from the United<br>
    Federation of Planets. I am<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the<br>
    USS Enterprise. This is Counselor<br>
    Troi, and Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Riva remains impassive. He again studies the away<br>
    team. Then he makes a slight MOVE with HIS HANDS. And<br>
    the Chorus SPEAKS.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    GREETINGS!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Welcome to Ramatis.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    I have been expecting you.</p>
  <p> The away team is surprised.</p>
  <p> The Warrior/Adonis member of the Chorus, takes a step<br>
    closer to Troi, and gives her a blinding smile.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    You're empathic.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Then, although you already know<br>
    my feelings toward you, allow<br>
    me to put them into words. I<br>
    am looking forward to this<br>
    journey, now more than ever,<br>
    because it gives me the chance<br>
    to spend time in your company.</p>
  <p> Warrior/Adonis smiles, then all expression leaves his<br>
    face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (she speaks to Riva,<br>
    not Warrior/Adonis)<br>
    I am flattered. And I too, look<br>
    forward to learning more about<br>
    you.</p>
  <p>24 PICARD</p>
  <p> He looks the Chorus over, then turns to Troi for<br>
    advice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quietly to Picard)<br>
    There's a very different kind of<br>
    communication here, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, so I see. I think there are<br>
    facets to Riva about which we were<br>
    not informed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Precisely. It is a process which<br>
    has developed over the centuries<br>
    and one I find quite harmonious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So Riva the famous mediator is... ?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Deaf.<br>
    (with great conviction)<br>
    Born, and hope to die.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (indicating Chorus)<br>
    And you all speak for Riva?</p>
  <p> CHORUS<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    I not only convey his words, but<br>
    his emotional intent as well.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The members of the Chorus, serve<br>
    as &quot;translators,&quot; and each<br>
    represents the archetypes of man's<br>
    personality.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    I am the scholar. I represent<br>
    the intellect. I speak in<br>
    matters of judgment -- philosophy -- logic.<br>
    Also, I am -- the dreamer.<br>
    The part which longs to see the<br>
    beauty beyond the truth which is<br>
    always the first duty of art.<br>
    I am the poet...</p>
  <p> Riva makes a slight movement and the Scholar/Artist --<br>
    shuts up and steps back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Artists tend to ramble, they live<br>
    too much in the future, they<br>
    neglect the moment. I am Riva's<br>
    libido. I am his passion. I am<br>
    the anarchy of lust. The romantic -- the<br>
    (with a little<br>
    self-deprecating nod<br>
    to Troi)<br>
    ... lover. Also, I am as he.<br>
    (indicates Worf)<br>
    The definition of Riva's honor...<br>
    the perfect line which never<br>
    wavers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the Woman)<br>
    And you...</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    I represent that part of Riva<br>
    which binds all the others<br>
    together. I am harmony -- wisdom -- balance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the Woman)<br>
    Remarkable. How did this...</p>
  <p> Riva flashes anger.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Speak to me!</p>
  <p> The away team is surprised by the outburst. Worf<br>
    instinctively steps forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?!</p>
  <p> Again Riva gestures aggressively.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Speak directly to me!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (so Riva cannot read<br>
    her lips)<br>
    He's prodding you to get a<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riva)<br>
    The uniqueness of this<br>
    presentation provoked my<br>
    inadvertent breach in protocol.<br>
    No insult was intended.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Then... none is perceived.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I was curious about how this<br>
    unique form of communication came<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    The gene for hearing is not<br>
    present in our planet's ruling<br>
    line.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Not that unusual, indeed it is<br>
    similar to the English Tudor<br>
    monarchs of your planet Earth,<br>
    all who had hemophilia. Or the<br>
    leaders of Fendaus Five, who were<br>
    without limbs.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Throughout time, many of the<br>
    galaxy's greatest contributors<br>
    have been similarly &quot;special.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riva)<br>
    Your ability to read lips -- is<br>
    very impressive.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your &quot;translators&quot; do not see you,<br>
    yet they are able to accurately<br>
    convey your thoughts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    My Chorus is so attuned -- they<br>
    can &quot;hear&quot; my hands and translate<br>
    to you. It is a relationship<br>
    which has developed over centuries -- their<br>
    ancestors provided the<br>
    same service to my ancestors.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your way of communication is most<br>
    distinctive, Riva.</p>
  <p> The Warrior/Adonis shifts his place on the steps,<br>
    closer to her.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    It takes a fine mind to appreciate<br>
    that, Counselor Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (indicates<br>
    Warrior/Adonis)<br>
    This part of you does not seem<br>
    to speak very often.</p>
  <p> Riva's eyes dance in flirtation.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Only when the spirit moves me.</p>
  <p> His gaze is intense, very male. Troi lowers her eyes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riva -- if you are ready -- the<br>
    situation at Solais Five is very<br>
    critical. We should not delay.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    I will prepare for departure<br>
    immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you all -- I mean -- Riva, did<br>
    you plan to take these people with<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    (challenging)<br>
    Is that a problem?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, it's just that we didn't know<br>
    you would all be coming.</p>
  <p> Riva descends the steps, toward Troi.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    How long will my journey to<br>
    Solais take?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    More than two of your days.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    (Riva comes up and<br>
    beside them)<br>
    Then, until duty calls, this will<br>
    indeed be a pleasant trip.</p>
  <p>25 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The away team, now including Riva and his Chorus, move<br>
    slightly to the side. Worf touches his communicator.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    With your permission, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enterprise, this is the away team,<br>
    seven to beam up.</p>
  <p> Riva, the Chorus, and the away team BEAM UP to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>26 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Ramatis.</p>
  <p>27 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker has the Command Chair, Data is at Ops, Wesley<br>
    has the Conn. PULASKI and GEORDI are also on the<br>
    bridge. Riker is anxious to get underway, and relieved<br>
    when he hears:</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER CHIEF'S COM VOICE<br>
    The away team, plus four, is on<br>
    board.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Acknowledged. Ensign, set your<br>
    course for Solais Five.</p>
  <p> Wesley inputs the coordinates.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Course is set.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Velocity -- warp eight.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Warp eight -- aye.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Engage, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>28 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stretches into warp.</p>
  <p>29 ANOTHER ANGLE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift opens, Picard leads the others onto the<br>
    bridge. Worf goes immediately to his position. Riker<br>
    stands, ready to greet his guest.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>30 ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM AND RIVA</p>
  <p> They enter, cross to Riker. Picard begins the<br>
    introductions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riva, may I present--</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (indicating the Chorus)<br>
    What's this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These three -- speak for Riva.</p>
  <p> Riker also reacts with surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You mean, the most respected<br>
    negotiator in the Federation -- is<br>
    deaf? Amazing.</p>
  <p> SCHCLAR/ARTIST<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    First, Captain, let me say that<br>
    it is an honor to be on board such<br>
    a fine vessel.<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now... please continue with the<br>
    introductions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is my first officer,<br>
    Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    It is an honor to meet you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data.</p>
  <p> Riva looks Data up and down. Then smiles.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    It is a pleasure to meet such a<br>
    unique individual.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you...</p>
  <p> Riva responds with a nod.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And our chief medical officer,<br>
    Katherine Pulaski.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Lieutenant La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Pleased to meet you, sir.</p>
  <p> Riva touches his VISOR gently.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    What is that you're wearing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A VISOR. It modifies the<br>
    electromagnetic spectrum and<br>
    carries the readings to my brain.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    And without it, can you see?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No. Without it I'm as blind as<br>
    a post.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Your VISOR serves the same purpose<br>
    as my Chorus, which &quot;hears&quot; my<br>
    thoughts and translates them into<br>
    sound.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    And you don't resent it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The VISOR or being blind?</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Either.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They are both part of me, and<br>
    since I like who I am, why would<br>
    I resent either being blind or<br>
    wearing the VISOR?</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    What is your position on this<br>
    ship?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Engineering officer, sir.</p>
  <p> Riva feels a kinship with Geordi and it shows in his<br>
    movements. He puts a friendly hand on Geordi's<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    It's a blessing to understand we<br>
    are special...<br>
    (then including<br>
    everyone)<br>
    ... each in his own way.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My feeling exactly.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Please call me Riva.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay. And you can call me Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will have you shown to you<br>
    quarters, then at your convenience<br>
    I have prepared a briefing on the<br>
    Solari wars? I offer the<br>
    hospitality of my ship during this<br>
    journey. We will provide whatever<br>
    is necessary to make you<br>
    comfortable or to facilitate your<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Riva turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Perhaps, if it is not<br>
    inconvenient, Counselor Troi could<br>
    escort me.<br>
    (then to Picard)<br>
    With your permission.</p>
  <p> Picard nods his approval.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p> They watch as Troi, Riva and the Warrior/Adonis exit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about you?</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    At times like this -- we become<br>
    an encumbrance.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    ... so if you have a room for us,<br>
    we'll wait until Riva makes<br>
    contact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly how will he do that?</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    The headband that he wears -- it<br>
    transmits his thoughts, and<br>
    emotions to us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So that's how it work.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    No magic -- just technology.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf, could you provide an escort.</p>
  <p> Worf nods to an n.d. crewmember. The Woman and the<br>
    Scholar/Artist, follow the crewmember to the turbolift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's not what I expected.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Perhaps being &quot;special&quot; is in part<br>
    responsible for his success. He<br>
    has a most disarming quality.<br>
    He doesn't just ask questions<br>
    to be polite -- he actually wants<br>
    to hear the answers.</p>
  <p>31 INT. GUEST QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The doors open and Troi ushers Riva and the<br>
    Warrior/Adonis in. This should be very interesting -- the<br>
    Warrior/Adonis does all the talking, but the eye<br>
    contact -- the heat -- is totally and completely between<br>
    Riva and Troi. The Warrior/Adonis is there... but his<br>
    presence is not felt.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Much of what we do is similar.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes -- I suppose in a way it is.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    We have both learned how to allow<br>
    people to examine feelings hidden<br>
    deep within their psyche. In<br>
    fact, being here with you is<br>
    provoking an emotional revelation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    You mean something I am doing is<br>
    uncovering an emotion buried in<br>
    your psyche.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Not that deep.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, exactly what are you feeling?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Can't you tell?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Some of it -- but...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    I feel that soon, perhaps after<br>
    the briefing by your captain, you<br>
    will be hungry, and perhaps we<br>
    could dine together and<br>
    compare... experiences.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I would like that.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    As will I.</p>
  <p> They hold the look for a beat -- and the heat between<br>
    them builds.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Will you...<br>
    (meaning the translator)<br>
    ... be with us?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Until we find our own method of<br>
    communication.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I look forward to that time.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    As do I.</p>
  <p> With a look Troi turns and exits.</p>
  <p>32 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The members of the Chorus should not be like bumps --<br>
    just standing there waiting for Riva to pull their<br>
    string. They can move. The Warrior/Adonis can get<br>
    a cup of Fagomerian Tea -- the Woman can be busy with<br>
    her hands -- doing some twenty-fourth century needlepoint (she<br>
    could appear disinterested in all of this talk of war).<br>
    The Scholar/Artist can have a PADD and be working out some<br>
    equation which is important only to him. Also it is<br>
    important that the delivery NOT be too stylized or<br>
    stilted.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Data, would you please<br>
    update the situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The factions on Solais Five are<br>
    historical enemies. So many have<br>
    died that both societies are on<br>
    the verge of extinction.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Enough. Thank you, Captain, but<br>
    there is no need to continue.<br>
    The specific issues of the<br>
    conflict have no relevance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So none of the background we have<br>
    prepared would be helpful in<br>
    understanding why they continue<br>
    to fight?</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    The portfolio will indicate that<br>
    the conflict is over a piece of<br>
    land, or wealth, or some other<br>
    tangible asset. But, we both know<br>
    that is not the case.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    A war which has been fought for<br>
    this long has become very<br>
    personal.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Exactly. The basis for peace must<br>
    also be personal.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    This is an historic confrontation.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Correct?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The factions have been at war for<br>
    fifteen centuries.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    What's changed?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know what you mean.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    They have been killing each other<br>
    for a long time, now they want<br>
    to talk peace. So something about<br>
    this situation has changed.<br>
    What's the new piece to the<br>
    puzzle?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That piece of information could<br>
    be very useful. Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Perhaps they are running out of<br>
    people to kill. In any case, for<br>
    whatever reason -- peace is now<br>
    preferred. That should make your<br>
    job easier.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Well, if not easier, at least<br>
    possible, because they are<br>
    motivated.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    But it doesn't matter. I'll find<br>
    something. I always do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Always?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    To date, I have never failed.<br>
    Now, unless there is something<br>
    else...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. This is for your benefit.</p>
  <p> The Woman puts away her &quot;needlework,&quot; stands and speaks<br>
    for the first time.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Then... thank you for your time<br>
    and effort... if you'll excuse<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    I believe I have to get ready<br>
    for a dinner appointment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, by all means, meeting is<br>
    adjourned.</p>
  <p> As Riva and the others leave, Riker and Picard:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our mediator is very...<br>
    (he pauses to pick the<br>
    correct word)<br>
    ... self assured.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cocky is the word I would have<br>
    used.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's all right if he can deliver,<br>
    and we'll know that soon enough.</p>
  <p>33 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> streaks along at warp speed.</p>
  <p>34 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard sits in his Command Chair. Riker is beside him.<br>

  <p>35A INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riva and Troi are sharing a meal. The Warrior/Adonis<br>
    is off to one side out of Troi's line of vision.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We have arrived.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Then we don't have much time.</p>
  <p> Troi agrees.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    This has been very pleasant.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    For me as well. I'm impressed,<br>
    by how you deal with what some<br>
    would consider a handicap.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    It's not a handicap at all.<br>
    Unless you mean having me here.</p>
  <p> Troi glances from the Warrior/Adonis to Riva.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I did not mean that specifically,<br>
    but, yes, I would consider you<br>
    a disadvantage.</p>
  <p> With that the Warrior/Adonis gets to his feet and<br>
    exits. Troi and Riva are now alone. For a beat they<br>
    are quiet.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How do we communicate? I can feel<br>
    your emotions, but don't we need<br>
    words?</p>
  <p> He signs something.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 27.</p>
  <p>35A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He signs gracefully with his whole being, hands, eyes,<br>
    body. Troi follows along.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Is that dream?</p>
  <p> He crosses his fists over his heart.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Love.</p>
  <p> She does the same, self-conscious with the intimate<br>
    gesture.</p>
  <p> RIVA<br>
    (signing)<br>
    Stronger. Like you mean it.</p>
  <p> Repeats the motion, eyes never leaving hers. She<br>
    echoes him, meeting his gaze.</p>
  <p> RIVA<br>
    (continuing; signing)<br>
    Butterfly.</p>
  <p> Troi makes the same gesture.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Is that a butterfly -- or is that<br>
    desire?</p>
  <p> Together their hands fly in the air. They laugh like<br>
    kids. Riva's hands float, alight on hers.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    It is localized -- and very<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    So much for the cease-fire.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can establish voice only.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    commander of the Federation<br>
    starship USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> A CRACKLING VOICE is HEARD, but is unintelligible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If you continue to violate the<br>
    rules by breaking the cease-fire,<br>
    I will abort this mission.</p>
  <p> A pause, then:</p>
  <p> FIRST LEADER'S COM VOICE<br>
    You have no jurisdiction here,<br>
    Picard. Where is Riva?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riva is in charge of the summit.<br>
    I command the ship that brings<br>
    him. I will not endanger my ship<br>
    under any circumstances.</p>
  <p> SECOND LEADER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riva gave his word we would speak<br>
    to no one else. Now who breaks<br>
    the rules? Where is Riva?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (formal)<br>
    I shall summon him for you.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Data.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Get Riva now!</p>
  <p>37A INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riva and Troi are still enjoying each other's company.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Counselor Troi. Have Riva report<br>
    to the bridge immediately.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They need you on the bridge.<br>
    Now!</p>
  <p>38 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Riva, his Chorus and Troi enter. Riva's confidence<br>
    now carries a touch of arrogance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The cease-fire has been broken.</p>
  <p> Riva takes charge of the situation.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    I'm sure I can resolve that. Put<br>
    them on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> He stands in front of the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On viewscreen.</p>
  <p> Distorted IMAGES of FIRST LEADER and SECOND LEADER appear<br>
    on the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The quality of the transmission<br>
    is very poor.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    It is sufficient.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 30.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He turns his attention to the viewscreen. The<br>
    spotlight is on him, he clearly relishes his position<br>
    and power.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    (stands right behind<br>
    Riva)<br>
    Brothers! Your bravery as<br>
    fighters is known, now you must<br>
    demonstrate your courage in a new<br>
    way -- cease hostilities -- allow<br>
    us to meet.</p>
  <p> There is a pause as everyone watches the staticky<br>
    viewscreen, then:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The laser fire has ceased.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But for how long -- these Solari<br>
    don't seem likely candidates for<br>
    peace.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I will need to see a topographical<br>
    overlay of the battle area in<br>
    order to pick a site for the<br>
    meetings. Then I will need your<br>
    help in creating the proper<br>
    setting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We are here to provide whatever<br>
    service is necessary.</p>
  <p>39 PICARD, RIVA AND DATA - LATER</p>
  <p> They are back at Science One looking at a display of<br>
    the planet surface.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    There -- beam us down to that<br>
    hilltop and inform the factions<br>
    to join us. The time for killing<br>
    has come to an end.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT TWO 31.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riva and his Chorus leave the bridge.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>40 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Solais Five.</p>
  <p>41 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riva is there with his Chorus -- Worf and Riker, both of<br>
    whom are carrying phasers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set phasers on stun.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    You won't need those.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure we won't.</p>
  <p> Worf and Riker check their weapons, then:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> They BEAM OUT.</p>
  <p>42 EXT. SOLARI PLANET - DUSK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Riva, and his Chorus MATERIALIZE onto a<br>
    flattened mountain top... which is the middle of the<br>
    war zone. The area is battle scarred; devoid of any<br>
    life or vegetation. Riva looks around the area.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Yes. This will do.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    It is important that we set this<br>
    up properly.</p>
  <p> Riva moves to the middle of the flattened area.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Commander. If it be possible -- I<br>
    would like torches -- there -- there - there<br>
    -- and there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    communicator)<br>
    Engineering, this is the away<br>
    team.</p>
  <p>42A INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi has been waiting for this call.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    We are going to need your help.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, I thought you might.</p>
  <p>42B EXT. PLANET</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We are going to need torches --<br>
    head high.<br>
    (to Riva)<br>
    ... and what else?</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    I would like a table and<br>
    chairs --<br>
    (he points)<br>
    ... right here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Describe it.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    Round, about three meters in<br>
    diameter, and if possible made<br>
    out of indigenous rock.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you copy that, Geordi?</p>
  <p>43 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I did. There should be no problem<br>
    replicating a table like that.<br>
    I have the coordinates -- I'll<br>
    send down the torches, and get<br>
    right on the table.</p>
  <p>44 EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riva is very relaxed. His confidence is high. He<br>
    continues his survey of the area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long before the emissaries<br>
    arrive?</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    It shouldn't be too long.</p>
  <p> Off to the side, four torches MATERIALIZE. The<br>
    Warrior/Adonis and Worf move to set them up.</p>
  <p>44A ANGLE WORF</p>
  <p> as he plants one of the torches in the ground and looks<br>
    out over the battle-scarred land. He scans the<br>
    horizon. Riker comes up behind him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are coming.</p>
  <p>44B SCENE</p>
  <p> The Warrior/Adonis and Worf light up the torches. Riva<br>
    has moved to the center of the flattened area.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How long will it take for these<br>
    negotiations?</p>
  <p> Riva has to chuckle.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    From that question, you must think<br>
    they will go quickly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>44B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Actually, until this moment I<br>
    never thought much about it at<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> Before Riva can answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker turns. Worf indicates the imminent arrival of<br>
    one GROUP of SOLDIERS.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    (to Worf and Riker)<br>
    The first few minutes will be very<br>
    tense. Please...<br>
    (the Scholar/Artist<br>
    turns and gives Riva<br>
    a puzzled look, almost<br>
    like they have a bad<br>
    phone connection, then<br>
    turns back and<br>
    continues)<br>
    ... ah... stay calm, and do not<br>
    respond even if you are provoked.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (with a glance at Worf,<br>
    who can be provoked<br>
    by an ambiguous<br>
    greeting)<br>
    We will do our best.</p>
  <p>45 SCENE</p>
  <p> The first group of soldiers appear. They are fearsome<br>
    looking. They come up the rise and pause. One -- the<br>
    leader -- holds his position while the other two ease<br>
    off to either side.</p>
  <p> FIRST LEADER<br>
    Who is Riva?</p>
  <p> Riva moves forward. He is the picture of confidence,<br>
    calm, assurance.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    I am Riva.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Before the introduction can be completed, the other<br>
    COMBATANTS appear. They enter even more cautiously<br>
    than the first. They have already spread out. Their<br>
    weapons are down but at-the-ready. The second leader<br>
    edges forward.</p>
  <p>46 WORF</p>
  <p> Has his hand on his phaser -- ready to take control of<br>
    the situation.</p>
  <p>47 RIVA</p>
  <p> He looks at each leader and nods a welcome.</p>
  <p>48 LEADER ONE</p>
  <p> He gives Riva a sideways look. His eyes never leave<br>
    the other warrior.</p>
  <p>49 LEADER TWO</p>
  <p> For him it is the same.</p>
  <p>50 SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are on their guard. This is a very<br>
    tense situation. The opposing groups eye each other<br>
    like the natural enemies they are. Each expects the<br>
    other to break the truce.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Be at ease. I commend you both.<br>
    To come here shows not only<br>
    courage, but wisdom. Please -- give<br>
    this conference a chance.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    (to the leaders)<br>
    I have no magic. You have been<br>
    fighting all your lives. You know<br>
    only...</p>
  <p> Suddenly the Scholar/Artist stops. His face turns to a<br>
    mask of confusion. He turns to look at Riva.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>51 RIVA</p>
  <p> He is stunned. Something is wrong -- something is very<br>
    wrong!</p>
  <p>52 SCENE</p>
  <p> The soldiers, feeling the sudden increase in tension --<br>
    react instinctively.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riva -- what is it?</p>
  <p> FIRST LEADER<br>
    This is a trap.</p>
  <p> The soldiers dash to positions of cover. Worf draws<br>
    his phaser and prepares to defend them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (without hesitation)<br>
    Enterprise -- beam us up. Now!</p>
  <p>53 ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the away team -- Riva and his Chorus are BEAMED back<br>
    onto the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>54 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log.</p>
  <p>55 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, and his staff are there with Riva. Picard has<br>
    in his hands the &quot;device&quot; which Riva has been wearing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So... communication between Riva<br>
    and his Chorus was aided by this<br>
    device. Without it...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Without it, he is mute.</p>
  <p> Picard turns it over in his hands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riva)<br>
    Can you fix it?</p>
  <p> He shakes his head, &quot;no.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can it be fixed?</p>
  <p> Riva motions frantically, &quot;I don't know.&quot; The<br>
    possibility frightens the hell out of him.</p>
  <p>56 ANGLE ON TROI</p>
  <p> She crosses to them, speaks softly to the captain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We must calm him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge. See what<br>
    you can learn about this. If it's<br>
    possible to repair it, I need to<br>
    know.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes the &quot;device.&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right away.</p>
  <p> Picard follows Geordi out the door.</p>
  <p>56A INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is there with the Chorus. They have lost their<br>
    sense of purpose.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    This is astounding. Nothing like<br>
    this has ever happened.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I need your help.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    But what can we do? It's Riva...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 39.</p>
  <p>56A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    We don't know anything. We just<br>
    say what he tells us.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We need to communicate with him.</p>
  <p> They have no answers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Surely you know sign language.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> WARRIOR/ADONIS<br>
    We've never needed it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And he neither reads nor writes.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    He's never had to.</p>
  <p> SCHOLAR/ARTIST<br>
    Riva knows sign language. He<br>
    learned it on a mission to the<br>
    Plaeties system. The parties<br>
    there were so paranoid they would<br>
    not allow us to accompany him.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Captain -- what's going to happen?<br>
    I feel so strange. I've never<br>
    been without him before... never.<br>
    I feel like I'm losing my mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll be all right. Stay here.<br>
    I'll send someone to look after<br>
    you. Please... try to stay calm.</p>
  <p> Picard exits. For a beat we HOLD on these poor lost<br>
    souls.</p>
  <p>57 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> As before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 40.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Deafness for all intents and<br>
    purposes has been eliminated<br>
    except for a few isolated<br>
    situations like this. If I can<br>
    help you medically -- will you<br>
    allow it?</p>
  <p> Riva stares at her for a moment. Picard enters. This<br>
    is not an easy decision. Then, probably with his<br>
    duties on his mind, he nods &quot;yes.&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riva knows sign language.</p>
  <p> Riva nods.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain. There are just in the<br>
    Federation, eighty-one different<br>
    variations of signing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Find a way to communicate with<br>
    him.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Take him to Sickbay. Doctor do<br>
    what you can.</p>
  <p> The Klingon helps Riva to his feet. Picard sees the<br>
    panic in his face, tries to reassure him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You are not alone. We will solve<br>
    this together.</p>
  <p> He seems small and fragile as Worf leads him away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If Riva does not mediate this<br>
    summit successfully, the Solari<br>
    will destroy each other.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But if he can't speak, and can't<br>
    use his Chorus, he's useless.<br>
    Captain, you should mediate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT THREE 41.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is not me they want. They<br>
    believe in Riva. The problem<br>
    is, he no longer believes in<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> Picard gets up, crosses to the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Keep me posted of Riva's progress.<br>
    I'll be in my quarters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have to find a way to talk<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> Picard exits. Off Riker's reaction:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>

  <p> in orbit around Solais Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8.<br>
    We are monitoring increased<br>
    military activity on Solais Five.<br>
    I fear that we will be unable to<br>
    keep the Solari from destroying<br>
    themselves without Riva and still<br>
    he is silent.</p>
  <p>59 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - AT SCIENCE ONE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data is at a computer terminal running programs which<br>
    depict various forms of signing. Riker comes up behind<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How's it going?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have eliminated all but five<br>
    distinct forms of signing. I will<br>
    learn them all.</p>
  <p>60 ANGLE ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Eyes on the computer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Computer. Show me gestural<br>
    language -- designation M-nine.</p>
  <p> As information appears on the screen, Data signs, hands<br>
    moving slowly. His hands move slowly as he get the<br>
    hang of it. Worf steps over to watch.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Interesting. A technique of<br>
    communication which is both silent<br>
    and covert. It could be very<br>
    useful.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data reads the computer screen and carries on a<br>
    conversation at the same time.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As a language -- the use of<br>
    gestures and hand signals<br>
    pre-dates the spoken word in most<br>
    cultures. The major exception<br>
    being the Leyrons of Malkus Nine<br>
    who actually developed a written<br>
    language first.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts. While, Data focuses on the computer,<br>

    He's very frightened. All his<br>

  <p> As Pulaski shakes her head.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Since Riva has never had hearing,<br>
    his brain cannot accept auditory<br>
    information.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    (to Riva)<br>
    Can you help?</p>
  <p> Riva makes a powerless gesture: &quot;How?&quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If he could tell me anything,<br>
    anything at all.</p>
  <p> Riva shakes his head, it won't work. Buries his face<br>
    in his hands. The anguish of not being understood.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Well, I'll continue to work on<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Then responding to Riva's anguish.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know what you must be going<br>
    through. I can imagine what it<br>
    would be like to lose my VISOR.<br>
    But... we'll find something.<br>
    Don't give up.</p>
  <p> Troi cocks her head, reading Riva, it makes her sad.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Too late. I think he already has.</p>
  <p> No interpretation necessary for the sign Riva makes.<br>
    He has given up.</p>
  <p>63 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> The CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Troi enters.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How is our mediator?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The same. Unreachable.</p>
  <p> Picard's face is etched with concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What can we do to help him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I can't do anything. It's up to<br>
    him. Confidence is faith in<br>
    oneself, it can't be given by<br>
    another.</p>
  <p> Picard takes a long moment to absorb this, then nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right, of course.</p>
  <p> Troi leans across the table, puts her hand over his.<br>
    The CHIME SOUNDS again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data enters.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I have reviewed and<br>
    stored five distinct signing<br>
    languages.</p>
  <p>64 ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> He turns to demonstrate his new ability.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This is blue. This is a blue<br>
    ocean. This is a blue ocean at<br>
    sunset. This is two people<br>
    walking along the beach by a blue<br>
    ocean at sunset. This is two<br>
    happy people in love walking along<br>
    the beach by a blue ocean at<br>
    sunset. This is --</p>
  <p> He'd go on forever if someone didn't say --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enough!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's talk to Riva.</p>
  <p>65 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Data, Troi, and Riva.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good news. Data has learned your<br>
    language. He can translate for<br>
    you at the summit.</p>
  <p> Data repeats Riva's signed reply.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    It will not work. I need my<br>
    words.</p>
  <p> Riva responds sharply.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing;<br>
    translating)<br>
    There -- that is what I mean. Your<br>
    translation is literal. You say<br>
    words. I do not need just words -- I<br>
    need nuance, and subtlety...<br>
    the shadings my Chorus enable me<br>
    to communicate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But your ability is unchanged.<br>
    All that's different is the method<br>
    of transmission.</p>
  <p> Riva's body language says it all.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    No! I cannot!</p>
  <p> Troi situates herself behind Picard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (softly)<br>
    It's not working. Go another<br>
    direction.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression changes. Body language becomes<br>
    forceful, angry.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data can understand you. Use him<br>
    as your Chorus. Let him express<br>
    your words.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    No -- it is not the same thing.<br>
    Data is unacceptable...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've got to take advantage of<br>
    what you've got...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riva looks at him for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    What I have got. I have got<br>
    nothing. Do you not understand - I<br>
    cannot do it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're right. Maybe you are all<br>
    show.</p>
  <p> Riva's eyes flash in anger.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You hide behind your Chorus.<br>
    (in his face)<br>
    You're a fake.</p>
  <p>66 CLOSER ON PICARD AND RIVA</p>
  <p> Riva takes a threatening step towards Picard. Catches<br>
    himself, signs with a smirk.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    You are attempting to provoke me.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, hopeful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing;<br>
    translating)<br>
    It is not going to work.</p>
  <p>67 ANGLE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> Disappointed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's too bad. A lot of people<br>
    are going to die.</p>
  <p>68 ANGLE ON RIVA</p>
  <p> in complete turmoil. Bolts from the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>69 PICARD</p>
  <p> He pauses for a moment. Then gets up:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> The android rises, then he and Picard exit in pursuit<br>
    of Riva.</p>
  <p>70 INT. GUEST QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard finds Riva. He gently touches Riva's shoulder.<br>
    Riva turns -- he tries weakly to smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will return you to Ramatis.</p>
  <p> Riva nods -- resigned -- very disappointed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... but, first I am going to<br>
    attempt to settle the conflict<br>
    on Solais.</p>
  <p> Riva signs -- Data interprets:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    You.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have come this far -- it would<br>
    be difficult for me personally<br>
    to leave without making the<br>
    attempt.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    It could be dangerous.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Help me.</p>
  <p> Throughout this exchange, Riva's mood will begin to<br>
    lighten. As he communicates with Picard, the very act<br>
    of self-expression slowly restores his self-esteem.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    How?</p>
  <p> Picard is driving this in a specific direction.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We all earn our reputations.<br>
    Yours is that of a very successful<br>
    negotiator -- a mediator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    And you want to know the trick.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If there is one - yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    Captain, there is no secret. What<br>
    I do is help one person -- one<br>
    group -- express themselves to the<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Simple enough to say - difficult<br>
    to accomplish.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    The real trick is getting them<br>
    to listen. To understand. To<br>
    turn a disadvantage to an<br>
    advantage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then why can't you turn your<br>
    disadvantage into an advantage?</p>
  <p> Riva studies Picard for a long moment. Then a smile<br>
    comes to his face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating)<br>
    That is an interesting thought...<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I do not understand -- what thought<br>
    is he referring to?</p>
  <p> Riva stands. He reaches out and shakes Picard's hand.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing,<br>
    translating)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will contact those down on the<br>
    planet. Tell them to prepare to<br>
    begin discussions immediately.</p>
  <p> Off Data's reaction:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>71 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Solais Five.</p>
  <p>72 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riva is there with Picard and Data, both of whom are<br>
    carrying phasers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set phasers on stun.</p>
  <p> Data and Picard check their weapons, then:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> They BEAM OUT.</p>
  <p>73 EXT. SOLARI PLANET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Riva, and Data MATERIALIZE onto the flattened<br>
    mountain top... Riva will sign and Data will<br>
    interpret. Data does not have to sign because Riva,<br>
    after all, can read lips.</p>
  <p> Riva looks around the area, then signs to Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (speaking for Riva)<br>
    Could you relight the torches,<br>
    to let them know that I am back.</p>
  <p>73A PICARD</p>
  <p> He moves to the nearest torch and relights it. Then<br>
    gazes for a moment out over the battlefield.</p>
  <p>73B SCENE</p>
  <p> Data has lighted another of the torches and is walking<br>
    toward the third. Riva moves to the middle of the<br>
    flattened area.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>73B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing to speak<br>
    for Riva)<br>
    I would like the table right here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (touching his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Main Engineering, this is<br>
    Commander Data.</p>
  <p>74 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - ANGLE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Go ahead, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    You can beam the table down now.</p>
  <p>75 EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riva is very relaxed. His confidence is back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It could be a while before the<br>
    emissaries arrive. They will be<br>
    more cautious after the last<br>
    incident.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (speaking for Riva)<br>
    You can leave whenever you choose.<br>
    I will get a message out when I<br>
    am ready to leave.<br>
    (to Picard as Data)<br>
    Captain -- I do not understand what<br>
    is going on here? Without his<br>
    interpreters, how can he mediate?</p>
  <p> The table MATERIALIZES while they talk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Riva is going to teach them sign<br>
    language.</p>
  <p> Riva steps forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (speaking for Riva)<br>
    Yes -- it is turning a disadvantage<br>
    into an advantage. Learning how<br>
    to sign will actually become part<br>
    of the process of them learning<br>
    how to live together in peace.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As they learn how to communicate<br>
    with Riva, they will be learning<br>
    to communicate with each other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (speaking for Riva)<br>
    ... and that is the first and most<br>
    important step in any<br>
    relationship.<br>
    (to Picard as Data)<br>
    Captain, although it took me only<br>
    moments to learn sign language,<br>
    it will take them months.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Time well spent.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (speaking for Riva)<br>
    These people have been fighting<br>
    all their lives, they know only<br>
    hatred, suspicion, fear. Even<br>
    with my Chorus -- I could not have<br>
    changed those attitudes in a day.<br>
    We have a chance, and they want<br>
    the talks to be successful or they<br>
    would not have called me.</p>
  <p> Riva steps over to the table and sits down.</p>
  <p>75A PICARD AND DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They move off to the side.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enterprise -- two to beam up.<br>
    (to Riva)<br>
    Good luck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (translating for Riva)<br>
    And to you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>75A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard and Data DISAPPEAR in the TRANSPORTER BEAM.<br>
    Leaving Riva all alone on the empty mountain top - waiting.</p>
  <p>76 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around Solais Five.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42111.8.<br>
    Personal comment. I am confident<br>
    that Riva can help the Solari<br>
    achieve a lasting peace. We will<br>
    deliver his Chorus to Starbase<br>
    Seven-One-Three so they can be<br>
    returned to Ramatis.</p>
  <p>77 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker has the Command Chair -- Picard is not on the<br>
    bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Take us out of orbit.</p>

  <p>78A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p> The CHIME SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Geordi enters.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Mister La Forge, something on<br>
    your mind?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>79 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Being Geordi, he gets right to the point.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sir, I know my VISOR gives me a<br>
    unique way of seeing that's<br>
    valuable to the ship, but if<br>
    something happened and I didn't<br>
    have it --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What makes you unique isn't your<br>
    blindness or your VISOR --<br>
    (searching for the<br>
    words)<br>
    To be special we don't need to<br>
    do a damned thing. Just be what<br>
    we are.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There's only one Geordi La Forge.<br>
    And I wouldn't want to run my ship<br>
    without him.</p>
  <p> A big grin spreads across Geordi's face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All right!<br>
    (more controlled)<br>
    I mean, thank you sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> Picard watches with a bemused, paternal expression as<br>
    Geordi exits.</p>
  <p>80 OMITTED</p>
  <p>81 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Geordi's in the examining chair.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Optic nerve laser welding. A<br>
    difficult operation. It might<br>
    not work. But if it did, it would<br>
    open up a whole world for you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Loud as a Whisper&quot; - 11/10/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>82 CLOSE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> He takes off his VISOR. Eyes exposed, face full of<br>
    fear and hope.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll think about it.</p>
  <p>83 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The bridge crew in their positions. Business as usual.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set course, two-two-four, mark,<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    What is our destination?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Alpha Delta Beta. A routine<br>
    transport mission.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I thought this was supposed to<br>
    be a routine transport mission.</p>
  <p> Out of the mouths of babes. Picard and Riker exchange<br>
    a knowing smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage!</p>
