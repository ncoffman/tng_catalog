  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves through space at impulse speed</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42502.7.<br>
    We are traveling in the Omega<br>
    Twelve System traversing between<br>
    a clustering of small planets that<br>
    form the coalition of Madena VI.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> We see the complement of people who normally make up<br>
    the bridge crew. DATA and WESLEY at the front consoles<br>
    controlling CONN and OPS. RIKER sits on one side of<br>
    PICARD at the Command Area, the opposite seat empty,<br>
    WORF stands near the Science Stations which are manned<br>
    by n.d. crewmembers.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Each of these planets is populated<br>
    by separate humanoid people who<br>
    co-exist and trade technology and<br>
    minerals under a precarious but<br>
    successful treaty.</p>
  <p>3 AFT STATIONS - MISSION CONTROL PANEL</p>
  <p> An ALERT SIGNAL FLASHES on the screen. The science<br>
    crewmember looks up to Worf who steps to the panel,<br>
    checks it and then announces.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have an unidentified vessel<br>
    approaching.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Give me grid markers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sector three-nine-five-six,<br>
    mark zero-nine-one.</p>
  <p> The personnel on the bridge show little emotion but<br>
    you can sense a little stiffening of their posture,<br>
    a glint of expectation in Worf's eyes. Picard sits<br>
    coolly and observes his well-tuned crew handling the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE ON SCIENCE SCREEN - INTERCUTS AS NEEDED</p>
  <p> Lines start to form the three dimensions blueprint of<br>
    a space vehicle, at first very sparse and then filling<br>
    quickly as more information runs through the computers<br>
    and information bands run across the lower portion of<br>
    the screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensor readings place overall<br>
    dimension of vehicle an<br>
    interplanetary cargo ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    One life sign on board, appears<br>
    to be humanoid.</p>
  <p> In the b.g. we see TROI exit the turbolift and take<br>
    her place quietly beside Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A vessel of that size usually<br>
    maintains a crew of six.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Minimum armament present.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors show cargo holds are<br>
    empty.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The course is inconsistent with<br>
    normal cargo routes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This could be a primitive method<br>
    to elude detection.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 SCIENCE SCREEN</p>
  <p> The three-dimensional schematic slowly revolves around<br>
    the screen showing all angles of the unidentified<br>
    craft. An alert RED DOT BLINKS on the interior of part<br>
    of the live blueprint and a band of continuing detail<br>
    specifications rolls across the lower portion of the<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Readout shows a burnout in<br>
    inertial guidance system...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The pilot is attempting to hold<br>
    his vessel in check manually.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That could be a pretense.</p>
  <p>6 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He speaks calmly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. We<br>
    have just encountered and<br>
    identified an interplanetary cargo<br>
    vessel which is apparently in need<br>
    of emergency assistance. We will<br>
    make every effort to do so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Open hailing frequencies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Hailing frequencies open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is the USS Enterprise.<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard, over.</p>
  <p> A pleasant male voice with the touch of laughter and<br>
    humor in it comes over the speakers.</p>
  <p> OKONA'S COM VOICE<br>
    And this is the cargo ship<br>
    Erstwhile &quot;limping&quot; and &quot;skidding&quot;<br>
    off course. Captain Okona at your<br>
    service. As you see, there is<br>
    no need for phasers, Captain.<br>
    I'm harmless and not quite ready<br>
    yet for mercy killing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were never considered a danger<br>
    to us, Captain Okona.</p>
  <p> OKONA'S COM VOICE<br>
    It's a shame. I can remember when<br>
    I was at least considered a<br>
    &quot;risk.&quot;</p>
  <p> There is a moment of silence, then the sound of Okona's<br>
    laughter, which builds and becomes infectious. At<br>
    first it puzzles the Enterprise crew, then the laughter<br>
    catches hold and slight smiles begin to break the<br>
    tension.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The ship is in viewer range now,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Main Viewer on.</p>
  <p>7 ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We now see the image of the man, his face slightly<br>
    turned from the screen and not clearly showing. His<br>
    joviality continues, and although more subdued, seems<br>
    to be just as contagious.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'm the owner and operator of this<br>
    craft and since we both know you<br>
    scanned my vessel, you know I'm<br>
    alone and empty...<br>
    (smile)<br>
    ... and it's truly a rare occasion<br>
    for a man of my charm, beauty and<br>
    talent.</p>
  <p> Okona mocks his own arrogance with his spontaneous<br>
    laughter. His humorous jab at himself takes the bite<br>
    off the remark.</p>
  <p>8 CLOSER ON MAIN VIEWER - OKONA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Turns his smile full face to the Main Viewer. He has<br>
    the look of a hero, the twinkle in the steely blue eyes<br>
    softening the rugged handsomeness of the man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    But then with the condition of<br>
    this vessel I'm glad I have no<br>
    responsibilities except for myself<br>
    till I can get some repairs.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, can you read him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    His emotions suggest that he is<br>
    mischievous, irreverent and<br>
    somewhat brazen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And some other things...<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    The word that seems to describe<br>
    him best is &quot;rogue.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Rogue? Accessing &quot;rogue.&quot;<br>
    (kicks in)<br>
    Cad, knave, rake, rascal,<br>
    scoundrel, villain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, all of that, but he shows<br>
    no malevolence, or ill will.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What form of assistance can we<br>
    offer you, Captain?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I had a burnout on my guidance<br>
    system. I'd appreciate it if I<br>
    could use your facilities to<br>
    repair it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It would be possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Estimate, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Time for repair would be seven<br>
    hours sixteen minutes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okona will have to shut down while<br>
    we verify specifications.</p>
  <p> Picard holds a few beats, then issues his orders.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, prepare security<br>
    procedures.<br>
    (to Okona)<br>
    We can accommodate you.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'll allow him limited access.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll prepare to shut down<br>
    your engines we'll lock on<br>
    tractors and beam you aboard.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Many thanks, Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Chief, prepare to beam<br>
    aboard from Tractor lock bearing.</p>
  <p> The well-modulated female voice of the TRANSPORTER<br>
    CHIEF, B.G. ROBINSON, answers.</p>
  <p> B.G. ROBINSON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes Number One, at your command.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Is that a woman's voice I hear?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Now please follow the<br>
    directions of Commander Riker so<br>
    our ship can get back to its<br>
    normal routine.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles as he moves away. Picard notices.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Something funny, Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The unexpected, like what's<br>
    happening now, IS our normal<br>
    routine.</p>
  <p> Picard muses for a beat, a slight nod shows his<br>
    agreement.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE / THE ERSTWHILE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the Erstwhile creeps closer and closer to its<br>
    docking berth, the vastness of the surrounding<br>
    starfield framing it with brilliance as the two<br>
    contrasting sized crafts seem to float closer and<br>
    closer.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Hold it steady, Wesley. We're<br>
    ready to link up. On my<br>
    command...</p>
  <p> WESLEY (O.S.)<br>
    Aye Number One.</p>
  <p> The Erstwhile reaches the proper point of contact.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Easy... easy...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Engage. Shut down engines,<br>
    Captain Okona.</p>
  <p> A laser-like RED BEAM shoots from the Enterprise and<br>
    locks into the nose of the Erstwhile and holds it there<br>
    in a stationary position. The Erstwhile shuts down.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> With the same crew intact except for Worf. Riker is<br>
    in his command position. He rises from his position.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Room proceed with<br>
    Beaming Operation. I'm on my way.</p>
  <p> B.G. ROBINSON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker, Wesley and Data move to the turbolift and enter.<br>
    The door slides shut behind them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf and TWO SECURITY MEN bracket the very feminine<br>
    and graciously endowed Transporter Commander B.G.<br>
    Robinson. Everything she has two of are perfectly<br>
    matched, coordinated, and move with a wonderful grace<br>
    that is called &quot;woman.&quot; B.G. goes through the<br>
    procedures of the transfer in her usual professional<br>
    manner.</p>
  <p>13 TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The heroic visage of Okona MATERIALIZES and smiles down<br>
    at the Group assembled. He is dressed in a<br>
    loose-fitting, open-necked blouse, wide belt and casual<br>
    looking pants, his look is in opposition to the<br>
    well-tailored Enterprise crewmembers. His sidearms<br>
    are also less sophisticated and are tucked into his<br>
    waistband. The malfunctioning guidance mechanism<br>
    swings nonchalantly from the burnt-out wires in his<br>
    grasp. Riker nods to Worf who steps forward.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your weapons, please.</p>
  <p>14 CLOSER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Okona and Worf study each other openly, that brief<br>
    moment of tension when two strong men measure each<br>
    other. Okona, still with a trace of a smile on his<br>
    face, diminishes some of the apprehension and gives<br>
    in to Worf's stature without surrendering..</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You're the tough one on this ship.<br>
    The muscle man.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Security.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    That's the usual name for warriors<br>
    nowadays.</p>
  <p> Okona unclips a belt and hands over all his weapons...<br>
    Worf still stands there... Okona's smile broadens and<br>
    he reaches behind his back and slips out a long heavy<br>
    knife. He hands that to Worf, hilt first.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It's more of a piece of jewelry<br>
    than a weapon. A remembrance.</p>
  <p> Worf accepts the excuse and the knife calmly, admires<br>
    its weight, balance, and sharpness.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will be returned when you<br>
    leave.</p>
  <p> Riker steps forward away from Data and Wesley, extends<br>
    his hand. Geordi is also in the room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome aboard, Captain Okona.<br>
    I'm Commander Riker.<br>
    (shakes hands)<br>
    If you turn over the inoperative<br>
    part to Lieutenant La Forge he'll<br>
    begin repairs.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'd be most happy to do the work<br>
    myself, I'm sort of a &quot;hands on&quot;<br>
    type...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That will not be permitted.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Can I at least watch? Maybe offer<br>
    some suggestions?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think that could be arranged...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves closer to Riker to accept the broken part.<br>
    Okona, with a twinkle in his eye, reaches around him<br>
    and hands it to a rather shocked Wesley.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Here you are, Lieutenant. I leave<br>
    it in your capable hands.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    No, this is Lieutenant La Forge,<br>
    I'm only an ensign.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Well ensigns have names, don't<br>
    they?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Wesley... Wesley Crusher..</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (enjoying himself)<br>
    Nice to meet you Ensign &quot;Wesley<br>
    Wesley&quot; Crusher.</p>
  <p> Accepts, Wesley smiles and shakes his hand. Geordi<br>
    nods his greeting to Okona, takes the damaged part from<br>
    Wesley; but before he can say anything, Okona has moved<br>
    across the room to face B.G. Robinson.</p>
  <p>15 FEATURING OKONA AND B.G.</p>
  <p> Okona stands directly in front of her, leans forward<br>
    and blocks her view of anything but him. He looks her<br>
    directly in the eyes, gets her full attention, then<br>
    slowly and with great gentleness takes a few wayward<br>
    strands of her hair and tucks it back behind her ear<br>
    as he speaks softly to her.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    And thank you for beaming me here<br>
    and inviting me to see a truly<br>
    beautiful woman.<br>
    (touches her chin)<br>
    You have the majestic carriage<br>
    and loveliness that could surely<br>
    be traced back to the noble<br>
    families who once ruled romantic<br>
    lands with benevolent and tender<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> B.G. smiles openly and knowingly, but plays along...<br>
    and Okona develops a hurt look. His eyes continue to<br>
    show his humor.</p>
  <p> B.G. ROBINSON<br>
    I'm sure you said that to many<br>
    ladies and it was no more true<br>
    then, than it is now.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Of course,<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But it's how I say it that's most<br>
    important. The feeling, the<br>
    warmth, the attraction I have for<br>
    you,<br>
    (soft beat)<br>
    the attraction that we share.</p>
  <p> B.G. stares at him for a few beats, then throws back<br>
    her head and laughs at his absolute but charming<br>
    brashness.</p>
  <p> B.G. ROBINSON<br>
    I haven't heard that approach in<br>
    years... it is refreshing...</p>
  <p> Okona laughs with her. He knows he's got her now.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLES ON RIKER, DATA, WORF AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> As they watch Okona whispering to B.G., Riker is<br>
    appreciating the showmanship and charisma of Okona.<br>
    Geordi, glancing over at the transporter station from<br>
    time to time and recognizing the situation. Data<br>
    merely observes all without any reactions. Riker<br>
    comments:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Okona seems to have excellent<br>
    vision and a healthy libido.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Which could add to the security<br>
    problem. I'll supervise him<br>
    closely.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (aware)<br>
    I'm sure you will, Worf.</p>
  <p> Riker turns away to cover his smile, tells Okona:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you'll follow Lieutenant La<br>
    Forge, we'll get right to work.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 SCENE</p>
  <p> Okona reluctantly breaks away from the beautiful B.G.<br>
    with a laugh and a squeeze of her hand. As he passes<br>
    Data's inquiring eyes, he comments playfully.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Now isn't that a beautifully<br>
    formed picture of sex appeal?</p>
  <p> Data glances from B.G. to Okona with a somewhat puzzled<br>
    expression.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know what you mean.<br>
    (beat; then explains)<br>
    I am an android.</p>
  <p>18 CLOSER ANGLE - WALK AND TALK</p>
  <p> For the first time Okona is quiet, but then he quickly<br>
    recovers with a smile and his usual glibness.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Well then... Have you seen any<br>
    great looking computers lately?</p>
  <p> Riker, Wesley, Worf, and Geordi break up. Data stares<br>
    from one to the other with a blank look on his face.<br>
    Okona eyes Data.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's a joke.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's funny.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (still oblivious, but<br>
    covering)<br>
    Yes, of course it is.</p>
  <p> They continue to walk down the corridor, the look on<br>
    Data's face showing his insecurity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>19 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING - JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Geordi and Okona handle the damaged mechanism while<br>
    Wesley works on something in the lower platform of the<br>
    tube. Wesley can see and hear the conversation. Okona<br>
    is quite knowledgeable in this field although limited<br>
    to his particular spacecraft. Geordi is more<br>
    interested in how he can improve the navigation tool.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's the Zelebium contacts that<br>
    wore down and then fused. Why<br>
    not replace them with Tricellite?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Tricellite isn't available in this<br>
    system. It wouldn't be available<br>
    to me if I have to replace it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think your spacecraft will<br>
    outlast the part.</p>
  <p> Okona glances at Geordi with the usual twinkle in his<br>
    eye and the trace of a smile on his face that is always<br>
    ready to broaden.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You mean the age of it or the way<br>
    I fly it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The stress test shows that you<br>
    tend to push it beyond its<br>
    designed capabilities.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge, I've never<br>
    been told that I'm somewhat<br>
    reckless in a kinder, or more<br>
    gentlemanly manner; but since the<br>
    pattern of my life has relegated<br>
    me to interplanetary speed<br>
    deliveries rather than universal<br>
    exploration, I'm forced to add a<br>
    flamboyancy and a zest to the<br>
    doldrums of my existence.</p>
  <p> Geordi laughs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>20 ANGLE DOWN THE TUBE - TO INCLUDE ALL</p>
  <p> Wesley looks up at Okona with some admiration.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain Okona, I don't know<br>
    whether I'd rather take a flight<br>
    with you or listen to you talk.</p>
  <p> Okona roars.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Thank you Ensign Crusher, Crusher.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (getting into it)<br>
    It's Wesley, Wesley.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'll make it easy on both of us.<br>
    I'll just call you Tiger.</p>
  <p>21 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Data has entered Engineering in time to hear the end<br>
    of the conversation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain Picard is not fond of<br>
    nicknames.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Your gallant Captain Picard. I'd<br>
    like to meet him... I'll stroll<br>
    on the bridge and say hello.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are not permitted on the<br>
    bridge. You are restricted to<br>
    your quarters or the Ten-Forward<br>
    lounge unless escorted by a<br>
    crewmember.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I've broken some small rules<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You do and besides the bells and<br>
    lights that will go off, our<br>
    benevolent and kindly Lieutenant<br>
    Worf will offer you a new kind<br>
    of greeting.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Well then, would you escort me<br>
    to C deck?</p>
  <p> Geordi studies Okona for a beat, then nods his<br>
    approval.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm busy rebuilding your ship.</p>
  <p> Wesley ducks down the Jefferies Tube. Okona glances<br>
    over to Data, smiles his best.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Then Mister Data sir, I would feel<br>
    privileged if you allow me to be<br>
    in your company while you escort<br>
    me to my destination...</p>
  <p> Geordi laughs... Data nods. Okona nods, looks a little<br>
    speculative.</p>
  <p>22 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Okona and the stolid Data walk down the hallway with<br>
    Data slightly in the lead. Okona keeps peeking at Data<br>
    but takes a beat or two before he speaks. Then he<br>
    finally does.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You ever been cold?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    How about warm?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The temperature on this vessel<br>
    is regulated to within a fraction<br>
    of a degree of the perfect comfort<br>
    range. I am also able to react<br>
    to any changes just as a humanoid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 17.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They continue their silent walk.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    How about drunk? Ever do that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not possible. One moment.</p>
  <p> Data stops dead in his tracks and runs through his<br>
    program. Only his eyes show a sort of blinking symbol<br>
    as he checks out his circuits for the answer.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was correct. I am not designed<br>
    to react to any synthenol intake<br>
    but apparently it is possible for<br>
    me to become intoxicated.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I don't understand that at all.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It seems that I have been adapting<br>
    some human peculiarities over the<br>
    last three tours of duty.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    What about love?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The act or the emotion?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    They're both the same to me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe that deduction to be<br>
    inaccurate.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Maybe.</p>
  <p> A sudden sadness comes to his eyes, then is quickly<br>
    replaced as he takes Data by the arm and continues his<br>
    walk down the corridor in feigned seriousness.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Life is like loading twice your<br>
    cargo weight on your spacecraft...<br>
    if it's canaries and you can keep<br>
    half of them flying all the time,<br>
    you're all right.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 18.</p>
  <p>23 ON DATA</p>
  <p> He stares at Okona with a blank look ignoring the<br>
    laughter that follows. Okona slowly subsides and<br>
    stares back at Data.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Don't you get it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Get what?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    The punch line... The gag... That<br>
    was a joke I told you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I still do not understand.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You don't know what a joke is?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course I do.<br>
    (as he computes)<br>
    A joke is an antic, a caper,<br>
    mischief, prank, trick, quip,<br>
    witticism.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    That's the dictionary meaning.<br>
    I'm talking about humor, fun.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you know what &quot;funny&quot; is?</p>
  <p> Data gives him a bewildered look. Okona gives up,<br>
    points to one of the doors.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Is that C-nine-two-nine?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The room to the left. Why?</p>
  <p> Okona smiles, shrugs..</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You probably wouldn't understand<br>
    that either...</p>
  <p> Okona presses the entry button on the specific door.<br>
    It slides open to disclose:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT ONE 19.</p>
  <p>24 CLOSER ANGLE</p>
  <p> The attractive and very sensuous B.G. Robinson who has<br>
    obviously been expecting his arrival. She returns<br>
    Okona's smile and steps away from the door to allow<br>
    him in. The door slides shut behind him.</p>
  <p>25 ON DATA</p>
  <p> His totally confused expression.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT ONE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>26 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> against the background of serenity and stars.</p>
  <p>27 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Riker looks over the shoulder of Wesley and Geordi,<br>
    and they check and test the contacts of the<br>
    malfunctioning Okona apparatus.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's the status of the repair?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    On schedule. The difficulty is<br>
    Okona has to be able to repair<br>
    this part himself next time.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Commander, do you know much about<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just that he's an interesting man.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    He's a lot more than that. He's<br>
    a capable engineer.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In a practical sense he's<br>
    excellent.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We've seen him handle his ship,<br>
    and he certainly knows how to<br>
    handle people.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything you say is true.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Then why is he what he is?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why is he operating a cargo route<br>
    alone rather than being a member<br>
    of a large organization like we<br>
    are?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, that's it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I would say because he chooses<br>
    to do exactly what he does.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    A cargo master?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (mimics the tone)<br>
    An ensign in Engineering?</p>
  <p> Wesley holds Riker's look, then smiles and nods his<br>
    understanding. Riker softens a bit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    His choice. Someday you'll make<br>
    yours.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I already have.</p>
  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p>28 INT. TEN-FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The stars in space zoom past the observation windows<br>
    which span the front of the lounge. Some n.d.<br>
    crewmembers are at the small tables at the bar. Data<br>
    is in conversation with GUINAN who is quite patient<br>
    but about to become brutally honest with him. It is<br>
    obvious that the conversation has been going on for<br>
    some time.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Okona is right.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You agree that I am missing a very<br>
    important human factor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    All I said was I agree with Okona<br>
    that you never smile or laugh.<br>
    At least I've never seen you do<br>
    it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do you? Ever?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I never knew I had to.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It's not a &quot;had to.&quot; Even Captain<br>
    Picard can't order you to be<br>
    happy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I am not unhappy. I just do<br>
    not seem to break out in laughter<br>
    with everyone else when Okona says<br>
    certain things.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You mean when he tells a joke.<br>
    (understanding now)<br>
    That's it, isn't it? You don't<br>
    have any idea what a joke is.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (defensive)<br>
    Of course I do.<br>
    (his computer kicks in)<br>
    It is a witticism, a gag, a bon<br>
    mot, a fluctuation of words which<br>
    concludes with &quot;trick&quot; ending,<br>
    it is...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Whoa, slow down. Now Data,<br>
    there's just you and me here and<br>
    nobody is going to know what we<br>
    talked about. My job here places<br>
    me under some obligations, like<br>
    a vow of secrecy. I can't repeat<br>
    anything I hear or see. Now the<br>
    obligation of the patron is to<br>
    tell the truth, otherwise I'm<br>
    being placed under a commitment<br>
    to keep a secret about &quot;nothing.&quot;<br>
    That's not fair. It's called<br>
    wasted honor. You understand?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>28 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (stolid beat)<br>
    I understand better than you<br>
    think. You just told me a joke<br>
    and I am not laughing.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (disappointed)<br>
    I can see that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Maybe it was not funny.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    It was funny.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How can you be sure?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I've used it before. Everybody<br>
    else at least smiles. It's you,<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I agree. Now what do I do about<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    When most people have trouble,<br>
    they look to a more intelligent<br>
    and learned being for assistance.<br>
    (thoughtful beat)<br>
    In your case, I'd suggest you go<br>
    to a bigger computer.</p>
  <p> That Data understands. He nods his acceptance, moves<br>
    off.</p>
  <p>29 INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HOLODECK</p>
  <p> Data is accessing the Holodeck panel. The panel lights<br>

    on a small stage in the center of a spotlight. Data<br>
    enters.</p>
  <p>31 INT. HOLODECK</p>
  <p> The image comes to life. The Comic takes a bow and<br>
    announces.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    Thank you ladies and gentlemen.<br>
    And thank you for bringing me<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I want to know what is funny.</p>
  <p> The Comic steps off the stage and takes a seat next<br>
    to Data. He stares at the blank open expression on<br>
    Data's face and realizes that he's in for it.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    Things that make you laugh are<br>
    funny?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nothing makes me laugh, but I<br>
    still want to do it.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    How much time do we have?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Time has no meaning in this<br>
    instance. It could be endless.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    I think we're going to need it<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I assure you, I am completely<br>
    trainable and capable of<br>
    indoctrination. Show me what is<br>
    funny.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    Okay, try this.</p>
  <p> The Comic distorts his face and posture, does a piece<br>
    of &quot;business,&quot; a comical imitation, using his clothes,<br>
    motion, perhaps a prop. He glances over to Data, who<br>
    stands motionless and passive.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is considered funny?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    It was till a few seconds ago.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You mean if you twist your face,<br>
    bend over at the waist, mess up<br>
    your hair, and cross your eyes<br>
    it is a pretense that would be<br>
    funny.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    (uncomfortable)<br>
    I have to admit it's a little<br>
    ridiculous, but that's part of<br>
    being funny. Clowns are<br>
    ridiculous, but they make people<br>
    laugh. Now try it.</p>
  <p> Data makes a couple of vain efforts to twist himself<br>
    and imitate the imitator. His attempts are clumsy,<br>
    inept, and bring a troubled look to the Comic's face.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Can you juggle, whistle, sing?</p>
  <p> Data shakes his head.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How about write or paint? I have<br>
    a house that needs painting. It's<br>
    hard work, but at least you don't<br>
    have to be funny. Just a strong<br>
    wrist, a good eye, and an<br>
    affection for watching water base<br>
    off-white dry slowly.</p>
  <p> The Comic laughs at his own humor. Data's sterile look<br>
    causes the Comic to grimace.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can do everything else that I<br>
    want to do. I just want to know<br>
    what is funny. I want to be able<br>
    to involve myself in other<br>
    people's laughter.<br>
    (quieter beat)<br>
    I want to &quot;join in.&quot;</p>

  <p> As he goes through his routine of jokes, CAMERA SKIP<br>
    FRAMES to:</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    ... comes up to his farmhouse<br>
    and...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Faster. Move to maximum speed.</p>
  <p> We SPEED UP FRAMES until the Comic is MOVING AT EIGHT<br>
    FRAMES PER and the DIALOGUE SOUNDS LIKE CHIPMUNK<br>
    GIBBERISH. HOLD on this for a few beats.</p>
  <p>33 ON DATA</p>
  <p> His eyes blinking in the information at the same<br>
    speed... Then:</p>
  <p>34 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Data is facing Guinan. He speaks in his usual<br>
    monotone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 28.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This gentleman went to see his<br>
    surgeon and was informed that he<br>
    needed an operation. The man<br>
    thought about that and then said,<br>
    &quot;I would like a second opinion.&quot;<br>
    The doctor said, &quot;Okay, you are<br>
    ugly too.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data immediately asks Guinan for her recognition.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Was I funny?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That joke has been funny for over<br>
    four hundred years.<br>
    (sad beat)<br>
    We'll now have a minute's silence<br>
    for its passing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was not funny...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Forget it. Try another joke.</p>
  <p> Data sets himself in a predetermined position and<br>
    starts.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Who was that woman I saw you with?</p>
  <p> Guinan flinches in expectation but is saved as the<br>
    voice of Picard is heard over the loudspeakers.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    (filtered)<br>
    Lieutenant Commander Data, report<br>
    to the Main Bridge immediately.<br>
    I repeat, report to the Main<br>
    Bridge immediately.</p>
  <p> Data moves quickly to the turbolift. As he moves, he<br>
    informs Guinan:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will be back.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (hopeless)<br>
    Bring new jokes...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 29.</p>
  <p>35 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> There is a controlled urgency in the conduct of the<br>
    bridge as Data enters from the turbolift and moves<br>
    directly to his station in Ops. Wesley is already in<br>
    place at Conn and whispers over to Data immediately:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    We have an &quot;unidentified&quot; in<br>
    Sector four.</p>
  <p> Data immediately focuses his attention on his necessary<br>
    functions. All stations are covered. Riker and Troi<br>
    bracket Picard. PULASKI will also appear on the bridge<br>
    during this scene. Worf announces from his Tactical<br>
    Station:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unidentified craft Sector four<br>
    to Sector four two six one.<br>
    Overtaking us, no response to our<br>
    hailing.</p>

    combat craft of the Squadron<br>
    Class, twenty-six crew.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (overlap)<br>
    Captain, they have locked phasers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (somewhat puzzled)<br>
    Phasers?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (same look)<br>
    Regulations call for a Yellow<br>
    Alert.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's too small of a craft to be<br>
    of any threat to us. Do you<br>
    agree, Lieutenant Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT TWO 30.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We could blow it out of space<br>
    before it could scratch our hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I doubt that they are so<br>
    primitive that they wouldn't know<br>
    it. Ensign Crusher, reduce speed<br>
    to allow them to overtake.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    May I ask why, sir?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They show a great deal of courage.<br>
    Perhaps I would like to show them<br>
    some respect, or perhaps I'm just<br>
    curious.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand, Captain. Would a<br>
    &quot;courteous&quot; Yellow Alert apply<br>
    at this time?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (covers a smile)<br>
    That won't be necessary, Number<br>
    One. But continue to hail them<br>
    and prepare for a gentlemanly<br>
    surrender if needed.</p>
  <p> The reactions of the crew, especially the pained<br>
    expression of Worf.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>36 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE / THE ERSTWHILE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Okona's ship in tow. Another spacecraft even smaller<br>
    and more outdated than Okona's approaches. In scale it<br>
    looks like a P.T. Boat pulling next to the USS<br>
    Missouri.</p>
  <p>37 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The business on the bridge continues in a relaxed, but<br>
    expectant manner.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still no response to our hail.</p>
  <p>38 ON CREWMEMBERS</p>
  <p> A few beats, then Data informs them:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The &quot;stranger&quot; vessel has slowed<br>
    and is holding its position.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, we are being hailed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>39 ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INTERCUT AS NEEDED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There are a few tense beats, then the face of DEBIN<br>
    slowly MATERIALIZES on the screen. He is a middle-aged<br>
    humanoid (perhaps one distinguishing factor to<br>
    designate him as different). We see a small passenger<br>
    area, rather than a large bridge.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    I am Debin of the planet Atlec.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard of<br>
    the USS Enterprise... What is<br>
    the reason for this aggressive<br>
    approach?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    You are towing a spacecraft of<br>
    a known criminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was in need of emergency<br>
    repairs. It was our obligation<br>
    to assist.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    You have a man by the name of<br>
    Okona aboard.<br>
    (harsher beat)<br>
    I want him.</p>
  <p> There are some reactions through the main cabin.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On what authority?</p>
  <p> Debin reacts to this with a tumultuous roar. He<br>
    explodes his response.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    He is guilty of crimes committed<br>
    on the planet Atlec. I expect<br>
    him to be turned over to my<br>
    authority immediately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What crimes?</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    That is neither important or<br>
    necessary. I want Okona now!</p>
  <p> Before Picard can respond.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Captain, we have another Class<br>
    four armed spacecraft approaching,<br>
    from the opposite sector...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Another ship from Atlec?</p>

    Similar in specifications and<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>40 MAIN VIEWER - INTERCUT AS NEEDED (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The screen fills with the picture of another ship's<br>
    cockpit area, which is a much smaller variation of a<br>
    bridge. Humanoid personnel pilot the craft. (There<br>
    could be a characteristic that would also mark them as<br>
    an individual race and also slightly different than the<br>
    Atlec race.) KUSHELL, older and more forceful than his<br>
    younger better-looking companion BENZAN, steps into<br>
    focus..</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    I am Secretary Kushell from the<br>
    Legation of Unity of the planet<br>
    Straleb.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    We know who you are, Captain<br>
    Picard. We have been monitoring<br>
    your communications and we know<br>
    of the demands made by Debin of<br>
    the planet Atlec.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you know that we intend no<br>
    hostile interaction with either<br>
    of you.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    You only have to concede to one<br>
    demand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The word &quot;demand&quot; has the tone<br>
    of finality.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    It is a word I have chosen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We demand you turn Okona over to<br>
    us immediately.</p>
  <p> Picard covers his reactions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Lieutenant Worf, Mister Okona to the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage the screen.<br>
    (to Kushell)<br>
    The same &quot;demand&quot; has been made<br>
    by the Atlec legation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    I have no interest in their<br>
    request. We intend to back up our<br>
    legal right to Okona.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (knowing)<br>
    I'd rather you didn't escalate<br>
    this situation any further.</p>
  <p> Benzan tries to guide the older man away from the<br>
    viewscreen. Kushell pulls away from his grasp.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    You're my son. You obey orders,<br>
    you do not interfere with them.<br>
    (to Picard, enraged)<br>
    We are prepared to take Okona by<br>
    force if we have to. The honor<br>
    and prestige of this nation are<br>
    at stake.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We are ready to die for that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We do not intend for that to be<br>
    at our hand. I will respond to<br>
    your request shortly --<br>

  <p>41 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and TWO SECURITY OFFICERS move through the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p>42 ANGLE ON DOOR</p>
  <p> It slides open to disclose a smiling Okona who is just<br>
    buttoning up his shirt and preparing to exit. A<br>
    well-endowed FEMALE CREWMEMBER (not B.G. Robinson) bids<br>
    him an affectionate farewell. The kiss becomes<br>
    extended and passion builds again, until interrupted by<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Okona)<br>
    I have orders to escort you to<br>
    the Main Bridge immediately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'm sure it can wait a few<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Now!!</p>
  <p>43 CLOSER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Worf steps face to face with Okona and sets himself.<br>
    Okona tightens and seems to coil just a bit in<br>
    preparation. The two of them face in a stand-off<br>
    understanding each other. Worf accepts the challenge<br>
    and declines it at the same time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I'd like that, but I have orders.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Some other time then.</p>
  <p> The tension is ended. Worf motions to the security<br>
    officers. They step on either side of Okona and leave<br>
    him no choice but to step away from his embrace. He<br>
    offers her a joking farewell as he is led away.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just remember, it took three armed<br>
    men to rip me from your arms.</p>
  <p>44 INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT</p>
  <p> Okona keeps pace with Worf as they enter the turbolift.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Am I going to meet Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> Worf eyes him a beat, then a grunting laugh.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Definitely.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Did I say something funny?</p>
  <p> The doors slide shut.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>45 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift door opens and Okona is escorted towards<br>
    the captain. Worf introduces.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain Picard, this is Thadiun<br>
    Okona.</p>
  <p> Okona steps forward, extends his hand, and prepares<br>
    himself for his normal overpowering greeting.</p>
  <p>46 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He swings around in his chair and holds Okona away with<br>
    his hard-probing look. The rest of the room waits.<br>
    Picard controls, points to the captain's Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In there... We'll talk in there...</p>
  <p> Picard gets up and leads the way. The doors slide open<br>
    and they enter. The crew eyes each other.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard turns directly to Okona. His anger is apparent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Okona, you were welcomed on<br>
    board and given the security of<br>
    this ship openly and without any<br>
    undue investigation. In turn the<br>
    only obligation we placed you<br>
    under was that you do not come<br>
    aboard the Enterprise under false<br>
    pretenses. It seems that you did.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    If you mean my &quot;socializing&quot; with<br>
    the members of the crew?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, you are free to interact with<br>
    the members of the crew. First,<br>
    I'm talking about a man named<br>
    Debin. Are you familiar with him?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>48 SCENE</p>
  <p> Okona becomes somewhat wary, but still faces Picard<br>
    with no fear or nervousness showing.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    He's from Atlec. I've had<br>
    dealings with some of his family.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then perhaps you can explain why<br>
    his spacecraft is prepared to<br>
    attack us unless we give him<br>
    custody of you.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I can't explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then tell me why Kushell of the<br>
    planet Straleb is demanding the<br>
    same thing?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Is he here also?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And quite adamant. Now answer<br>
    please. What crimes have you<br>
    committed?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I am not a criminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why do these men want you?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I can't say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You will say. You're on my ship.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (serious now)<br>
    It wouldn't be the honorable thing<br>
    to do. I may be many less than<br>
    auspicious things, but I am a<br>
    gentleman. I won't break that<br>
    code.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They are prepared to attack the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT THREE 39.</p>

    That would be crazy. They<br>
    wouldn't stand a chance...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Exactly.<br>
    (studies Okona)<br>
    Then perhaps you could give me<br>
    some reasons as to why I should<br>
    consider destroying these people<br>
    to save you?</p>
  <p>49 CLOSER</p>
  <p> For the first time Okona is at a loss for words.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I can't think of any right now.</p>

  <p> facing the two tiny and less formidable looking ships.<br>
    The Erstwhile still in tow and even smaller.</p>
  <p>51 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard regards Okona, still is in a no-nonsense mood.<br>
    Picard turns back to the Main Viewer</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put Debin on screen.</p>
  <p>52 MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Main Bridge of the Debin craft appears on screen.<br>
    Debin standing there gets right down to business.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    Have you made your decision yet,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. You've made your requests<br>
    but you haven't told me why.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    It's a personal matter.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm afraid that's not good enough.</p>
  <p> Debin visibly explodes. His rage balloons.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    Not good enough?? You're forcing<br>
    me to embarrass my family by<br>
    demanding reasons.</p>
  <p> Debin steps off screen for a beat, then returns with<br>
    a young tearful woman named YANAR. She is very<br>
    beautiful and also very pregnant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>53 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> All heads turn from the Main Viewer to Okona who<br>
    attempts to look innocent and therefore looks even more<br>
    guilty.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    It was Okona... He's been bringing<br>
    Yanar gifts, flowers, and even<br>
    poetry for the past five months.<br>
    He took advantage. Then he left<br>
    her like this. I want him.</p>
  <p> Picard feels uncomfortable, but now understands Debin's<br>
    emotions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I do sympathize with you. If you<br>
    will allow me just a little more<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    (not to be put off)<br>
    Why, so you can turn him over to<br>
    Kushell? You do that and I'll<br>
    blow his ship away and Okona with<br>
    it.</p>
  <p>54 ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Kushell suddenly appears on a SPLIT SCREEN and yells<br>
    back at Debin.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    You'll be dust before you aim your<br>
    first missile. I have a perfect<br>
    right to Okona. He's a thief.<br>
    He stole the Jewel of Thesia.<br>
    A national heritage.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    (yelling back)<br>
    A &quot;thing.&quot; An &quot;item.&quot; My case<br>
    involves the victimization of a<br>
    human form. My daughter.</p>
  <p> Okona steps nearer to Picard and can now obviously be<br>
    seen by the &quot;split screen&quot; characters. They visibly<br>
    react.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's him!! I'll have him now.</p>

  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    He's mine.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    One at a time. Who accuses me<br>
    of stealing?</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    I do, you thief. Me and my son,<br>
    Benzan. Okona was my son's<br>
    friend. He took advantage of that<br>
    friendship to plunder a national<br>
    treasure.</p>
  <p> Benzan is standing next to his father silently. We<br>
    hear some ad lib yelling in the b.g. as Debin responds<br>
    to Kushell. Picard signals to mute the sound on the<br>
    screen. (Kushell and Debin will continue their silent<br>
    argument.) Picard turns to Okona.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you have to say about that<br>
    Okona?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Nothing right now. Let them do<br>
    all the talking.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for a moment. Then interrupts the<br>
    arguing between Debin and Kushell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gentlemen if you please!</p>
  <p> Debin and Kushell quiet down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You will get my decision as soon<br>
    as I can confer with my advisors<br>
    and in the interest of maintaining<br>
    peace I am jamming communications<br>
    between your two ships. Picard<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> Before either of the two fathers can answer the screen<br>
    goes blank. Picard swings from his control chair.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Okona, Doctor, Counselor,<br>
    Lieutenant Worf, Geordi, the<br>
    conference room if you please.<br>
    Have Doctor Pulaski join us...</p>
  <p> The Observation Lounge door slides open and the group<br>
    files in.</p>
  <p>55 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> They take seats around the table. Okona takes the<br>
    opportunity to move to the food slot and concoct a<br>
    healthy snack.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Dishonesty, lust, and now hunger.<br>
    You really are extremely basic<br>
    Mister Okona.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Last meals always taste the best<br>
    and hunger won't make me a better<br>
    person.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That's probably true.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Neither one of the allegations<br>
    is considered a capital crime.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'll never reach either of those<br>
    planets alive. They have lost<br>
    too much face over these<br>
    incidents.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet it provides the<br>
    possibility of even more violence.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You're not afraid of those two<br>
    or what they can do to you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's what I may have to do to them<br>
    that concerns me. If I turn you<br>
    over to Debin, I will have to deal<br>
    with Kushell. If you go to<br>
    Kushell, I will have Debin to<br>
    administer to. Or perhaps both<br>
    of them would decide to attack<br>
    us. Fatalities could be total.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I hate to have to be the one to<br>
    say this, but you don't owe me<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm well aware of that, but it<br>
    doesn't change anything.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are you innocent, Thadiun Okona?</p>
  <p> Okona can't resist the glib one liner and the smile.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Innocent? Absolutely not, Captain<br>
    Picard. I'll make no excuses for<br>
    my lifestyle.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I have not committed the<br>
    crimes that I've been accused of<br>
    or any others similar.</p>
  <p> Okona turns to give Troi a questioning look. Troi nods<br>
    to Picard that he's telling the truth.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then my predicament is confirmed.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    In that case, Captain, I can't<br>
    make it any easier on you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    Apparently you've never been<br>
    concerned about making it easier<br>
    on anyone... There are two men<br>
    out there who do not consider this<br>
    a joke and are willing to face<br>
    death as a matter of honor. They<br>
    should be respected, not laughed<br>
    at.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>55 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You seemed to have reached a<br>
    decision about me, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Only about what I think you are.<br>
    What to do about it is still a<br>
    problem.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'll help you with it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Stall Debin and Kushell. Give<br>
    me enough time to get the guidance<br>
    system re-installed and I'll go<br>
    on my own.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Their ships are bigger and faster<br>
    than yours.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You'll still be able to warp away<br>
    and I'll take care of myself.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How will you get away?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (smile)<br>
    I'll dazzle them with my<br>
    brilliance and dexterity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't like it.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You have very little choice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a few beats)<br>
    I know. It will be impossible<br>
    to stall very long.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    &quot;Just long enough&quot; is all I<br>
    need...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What are you going to say to Debin<br>
    and Kushell?</p>

  <p>55 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Anything I have to.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Now you're starting to sound like<br>
    me, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Heaven forbid.</p>
  <p> Okona holds Picard's look for a beat, nods, turns and<br>
    enters the turbolift... Picard moves to the door to<br>
    the Main bridge. The doors slide open. Picard, Riker<br>
    et al walk through.</p>
  <p>56 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the command chair; Riker next to him.<br>
    Picard takes a breath.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Engage Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> Screen -- the spilt screen of Debin and Kushell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Ah, gentlemen... If you'll just<br>
    bear with me, I have a few<br>
    questions.</p>
  <p>57 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Wesley are still working on the Okona<br>
    mechanism. Okona looks over their shoulders, admires<br>
    it. Okona seems distracted, his mind somewhere else,<br>
    his conversation not up to its usual pace and humor.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Looks like an excellent job.<br>
    You're quite a craftsman<br>
    Lieutenant La Forge. How soon<br>
    will it be finished?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's the rush? I thought you<br>
    liked it here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I did. It stopped liking me.<br>
    Time for me to disappear.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Where will you go?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    A new place, if I make it.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Don't you ever stay anywhere?</p>
  <p> Okona snaps out of his mood a little, eyes Wesley.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Not for a long time.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know that's the way you want<br>
    to be and it is your choice, but<br>
    I don't understand. You like<br>
    people. Why do you want to be<br>
    alone all the time?</p>
  <p>58 ON OKONA</p>
  <p> He keeps his gaze on Wesley as his mind works. Geordi<br>
    interrupts, holds out the new part.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's ready. You should be able<br>
    to install this in less than five<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> Okona turns his look to Geordi, nods, but makes no move<br>
    to take the part from him.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Like you said Geordi, what's the<br>
    rush?<br>
    (moving)<br>
    I have some friends around here.</p>
  <p> Okona moves off. Geordi and Wesley exchange looks.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>

    position of the Debin and Kushell vessels, the same...</p>
  <p>60 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> All stations are manned. Okona enters from the<br>
    turbolift and waits there as Picard motions to him.<br>
    Picard turns back to the screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One moment please, gentlemen.<br>
    Screen off.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Okona.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've used every pretext I could<br>
    think of. The result is they've<br>
    aimed their full ordinance at us<br>
    and are prepared to attack. I<br>
    can't delay any longer.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'm not leaving.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    We've gone over this before. I<br>
    thought you made a decision.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Don't worry, I'm not staying<br>
    either.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    I've decided to surrender myself<br>
    to one of them.</p>
  <p> Reactions around the bridge...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Which one?</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Put them on screen and place your<br>
    bets. The odds are two to one...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker glances over to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>61 MAIN VIEWER - SPLIT SCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED)</p>
  <p> The images of Debin and Yanar on one half, Kushell and<br>
    Benzan on the other.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    It took long enough. Now when<br>
    can I have Okona?</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    I registered my complaint before<br>
    you. I have first recourse.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    Do not delay your decision again.<br>
    I'm warning you not to do that,<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, both of you are most adept<br>
    at issuing warnings.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Okona has volunteered to<br>
    deal with this himself.</p>
  <p> Okona steps forward to face the screen and also be seen<br>
    by all parties. Kushell and Debin are animated, Benzan<br>
    and the pregnant girl more subdued, waiting.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'll speak my piece before I walk<br>
    to your gallows. As I said before<br>
    I am not a thief. I am also not<br>
    a character of exceptional good<br>
    name and reputation; so, as I<br>
    never chose to become a thief,<br>
    I have never chosen to become a<br>
    father either.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    Given the choice between the two<br>
    I must say that marriage to the<br>
    beautiful and affectionate Yanar<br>
    is a much more pleasant sentence.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA (Cont'd)<br>
    (pause)<br>
    So my dear Yanar, if you would<br>
    do me the honor of becoming my<br>
    wife I will do everything in my<br>
    power to make our marriage happy<br>
    and fruitful.</p>
  <p> There is a shocked silence on both the Main Bridge and<br>
    the split screen. Varying emotions start to build.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    No! He can't!</p>
  <p> HUSHELL<br>
    My son is right. Okona will not<br>
    escape me that way.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    No, that's not what I mean.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    Send him to me. I'll decide his<br>
    fate.</p>
  <p> Yanar steps to the forefront.</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    Why should you decide? Why don't<br>
    I? Since everybody knows Okona<br>
    is the father of this child, why<br>
    should we not allow him to take<br>
    his rightful place?<br>
    (firmly)<br>
    I accept.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    You can't accept!</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    That's right. Okona is still a<br>
    thief.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    No he's not. Nothing was stolen.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    The Jewel of Thesia!</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    It was not stolen by my friend<br>
    Okona.</p>

  <p>61 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    Then where is it?</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    You could say it was taken into<br>
    &quot;custody&quot; by the rightful heir,<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Picard looks over at Okona who eyes Benzan with a look<br>
    of pride.</p>
  <p>62 VARIOUS CUTS AND ANGLES (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Debin and Kushell gain knowledge of the incidents<br>
    involved in both the theft and pregnancy. Kushell is<br>
    stunned, Debin glad to have it all settled. Benzan<br>
    is making his statement of fact; Yanar, not pleased<br>
    at the way it is all coming down. Okona, trying to<br>
    make them tell the facts; and, Picard, watching the<br>
    scene unravel to Okona's hopeful design and finding<br>
    himself becoming involved in the event and starting<br>
    to appreciate him a little.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Okona)<br>
    Benzan has a certain flair for<br>
    the language that is similar to<br>
    yours.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    A little bit of me might have<br>
    rubbed off on the boy. I didn't<br>
    think he would let me hang.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You placed great faith in him.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    He's a friend...</p>
  <p> Debin feels the whole thing is settled. He announces.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    (to Benzan)<br>
    Why would you steal what would<br>
    eventually become yours?</p>

    Yanar is carrying my child.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    Yanar said it was Okona's.</p>
  <p> DEBIN<br>
    (to Yanar)<br>
    You were with both these men?</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    No, but that's not what is<br>
    important now. What is important<br>
    is who I marry.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    You'll marry me.</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    Why should I?</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    Because I love you.</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    You waited this long to say that?<br>
    You almost allowed Okona to be<br>
    punished, now suddenly you wish<br>
    to marry me?</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    I sent the Jewel of Thesia to you<br>
    with Okona to declare us man and<br>
    wife. The politics of our fathers<br>
    would have been settled later.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    So Okona does have the jewel.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    I ordered him to deliver it!</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    And waited a little too long to<br>
    do that also. I won't marry you,<br>
    Benzan.</p>

  <p> YANAR<br>

    I won't marry anyone!</p>
  <p> Okona steps forward to the Main Viewer and speaks<br>
    seriously and with great feeling...</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Don't Yanar. You're angry about<br>
    the embarrassment of all this and<br>
    maybe the timing and approach is<br>
    not the most romantic, but I know<br>
    you love Benzan and I don't want<br>
    to see you throw away that feeling<br>
    because we adults do not know how<br>
    to behave properly.</p>
  <p> YANAR<br>
    If Benzan could speak with the<br>
    same integrity as you do, maybe<br>
    it would be different.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I carried your messages back and<br>
    forth for almost six months. I<br>
    smuggled each of you into the<br>
    other's homeland. You feel for<br>
    him the same way he feels for you.<br>
    (frustrated beat)<br>
    So for heaven's sake girl, you<br>
    have to marry the boy because I've<br>
    finally run out of words.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't believe that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is mathematically possible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Okona defies even the science of<br>
    mathematics.</p>
  <p> Okona laughs. Data asks Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Was that funny?</p>

  <p> Okona and the crew look over to Picard who is just as<br>

  <p> YANAR<br>
    I'll marry Benzan. It is his<br>

    It's our child.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>

    Then I'll have to withdraw my<br>
    charges of theft. By our law<br>
    Benzan must present the jewel to<br>
    his wife.</p>
  <p> BENZAN<br>
    I'll be coming for you shortly<br>
    Yanar. We'll find a new planet<br>
    to live on.</p>
  <p> KUSHELL<br>
    You'll live on Straleb.</p>

    No! You'll live here!</p>

    And?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No one laughed.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    No one? Nobody?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Me, I'm &quot;no one&quot; and &quot;nobody.&quot;<br>
    It wasn't funny.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She said I &quot;killed&quot; the joke.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's always hard to deal with a<br>
    solo person. You need a crowd.<br>
    Laughter is contagious.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    A lot of things are contagious.<br>
    Most of them aren't funny either.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps he is right. An audience<br>
    could be the difference.<br>
    (to Holodeck)<br>
    Holodeck, give me an audience.</p>
  <p>66 ON DATA</p>
  <p> He glances over to Guinan for support. She tries to<br>
    give it to him with a weak nod.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>67 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A SPOTLIGHT beam glares onto a small stage and the<br>
    Comic steps up for the intro.</p>
  <p>68 REVERSE</p>
  <p> There is a small, dark, smoke-filled New York style<br>
    nightclub with various n.d. audience sitting at<br>
    dime-sized tables.</p>
  <p>69 ANGLE ON STAGE</p>
  <p> The SPOTLIGHT glares on and the Comic steps onto the<br>
    stage for the intro. Guinan stands off to the side<br>
    at what could be considered the wings.</p>
  <p> THE COMIC<br>
    And now folks from his record<br>
    breaking tour of Straleb and Atlec<br>
    I bring you the funny man of the<br>
    stars, that comet comedian, the<br>
    sensation of the solar system,<br>
    ... DATA!</p>
  <p> The Comic backs off the stage to stand next to Guinan<br>
    and a tuxedo garbed (jacket and tie only) Data enters<br>
    into the beam of light with an impassive look on his<br>
    face and a monotone delivery which is accentuated<br>
    occasionally by the off time waving of one or both of<br>
    his arms. He keeps adjusting the bow tie, Rodney<br>
    Dangerfield style.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good evening ladies and &quot;germs.&quot;</p>
  <p> The audience sounds of laughter and applause.</p>
  <p>70 AROUND THE HOLODECK NIGHTCLUB - INTERCUT AS NEEDED</p>
  <p> The audience laughs at every move and word. Data<br>
    continues at first confident and then becoming<br>
    puzzled...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You know I come from a town so<br>
    small it had a fraction for a zip<br>
    code.</p>
  <p> Laughter.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... It was so small in fact that<br>
    it didn't have a Godfather of<br>
    Crime... it had a Nephew..</p>
  <p> Guinan gives the Comic a whimsical look.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You sure you made a living doing<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was so ugly as a child they hung<br>
    a pork chop around my neck so the<br>
    dog would play with me. Then<br>
    there was the gene bank where they<br>
    crossed a lion and a parrot. They<br>
    weren't sure what they got but<br>
    when it spoke, they listened.</p>
  <p> Data looks around. His voice is almost a whisper now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Or the human cannonball that was<br>
    hired and fired in the same night.</p>
  <p>71 ON DATA</p>
  <p> He stares down at the audience, still unsure as to what<br>
    they are laughing at. He moves his right hand.</p>
  <p>72 THE AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> Bellows out its response.</p>
  <p>73 DATA</p>
  <p> Aware now. He lifts his other arm.</p>
  <p>74 THE AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> responds with an uproar.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>75 DATA</p>
  <p> moves one finger... The response... He realizes now,<br>
    glances over to Guinan who offers him a sympathetic<br>
    look. Then he announces, as he steps off stage:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Holodeck off.</p>
  <p> The stage lights and nightclub disappear. Data and<br>
    Guinan are alone in the Holodeck room. They eye each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It was a Holodeck audience. They<br>
    were programmed to laugh at<br>
    anything...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Never mind that. Let me tell you<br>
    one about the traveling salesman.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have heard it...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have heard them all.</p>
  <p> Data and Guinan walk out of the Holodeck...</p>
  <p>76 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The full staff is present as they go through the<br>
    procedures of disconnecting Okona's craft from the<br>
    tractor link. Okona is on the Main Viewer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold the speed, Captain Okona.<br>
    We'll disengage at my command.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Disengage.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Separated.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    I'm under my own power. Thank<br>
    you, Enterprise. Thank you,<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it turned out to be &quot;my<br>
    pleasure,&quot; Mister Okona.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>76 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    You've got a bizarre sense of<br>
    humor, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stretched to the limit with you,<br>
    but thankfully still present.<br>
    I think I might miss your<br>
    presence, but I would like it to<br>
    remain a fond memory.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    Well put Captain Picard, and<br>
    good-bye sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good-bye Captain Okona.</p>
  <p> OKONA<br>
    What about you Data? You can say<br>
    good-bye, Data.</p>
  <p> Data is caught unprepared; his computer mind blinks<br>
    in and he responds quickly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Good-bye Data.&quot;</p>
  <p> First a titter of laughter, then building to a louder<br>
    sound. Data looks around the bridge in pleased<br>
    surprise. He looks towards Picard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Was I funny?</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at him, nods. Data looks up at the Main<br>
    Viewer.</p>
  <p>77 MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Okona gives Data the thumbs up sign.</p>
  <p>78 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it turns to the stars.</p>
  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    And there is the one about the<br>
    girl in the nudist colony that<br>
    nothing looked good on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; - 10/4/88 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Warp speed Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Please...</p>
  <p> The Enterprise warps out.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
