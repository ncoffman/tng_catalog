  <p> STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION <br>
    &quot;The Royale&quot; <br>
    <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around an ice-green planet with swirling white<br>
    cloud patterns.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    Ship's log, stardate 42625.4,<br>
    First Officer Riker reporting.<br>
    We have achieved orbit around<br>
    Theta Eight...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> at helm, DATA at Ops, WORF at his Tactical position.</p>
  <p>3 MOVE PAST THEM SLOWLY</p>
  <p> as RIKER walks from Command to the Aft Science Station<br>
    where GEORDI is studying a sensor readout screen of<br>
    the planet's atmosphere and surface.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... the planet furthest from its<br>
    sun in this previously unmapped<br>
    solar system. It is a world of<br>
    ruthless realities: particularly<br>
    harsh, barren, and inhospitable...</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE UP ON GEORDI'S FACE</p>
  <p> reflecting the screen's amber light. Riker STEPS INTO<br>
    FRAME behind him...</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our reason for being here -- a<br>
    passing Klingon cruiser reported<br>
    discovering pieces of a strange<br>
    vessel in the upper atmosphere.<br>
    We've come to investigate...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (studying the screen)<br>
    Nasty. Nitrogen... methane...<br>
    liquid neon. Surface temperature<br>
    minus two hundred and ninety-one<br>
    degrees Fahrenheit. Winds up to<br>
    three hundred and twelve meters<br>
    per second.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not exactly a vacation planet,<br>
    eh?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh uh. Not unless you like<br>
    ammonia tornadoes. Or orange<br>
    lightning bolts for that matter.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    Not my cup of tea. Found anything<br>
    artificial in the atmosphere?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing so far. We're just coming<br>
    around to the night side now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Keep me informed. The sooner we<br>
    identify what the Klingons think<br>
    they saw, the sooner we can get<br>
    the hell out of here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sounds good to me.</p>
  <p>5 STAY ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> as Riker walks away. He shakes his head as more data<br>
    return from the surface of Theta Eight...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    Nasty.</p>
  <p>6 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD sits on a chair staring at a tabletop viewer.<br>
    It has a number of equations and theorems on it -- like<br>
    a present-day blackboard. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS, looks at the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Fermat's last theorem. Familiar<br>
    with it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No. I'm afraid I spent too many<br>
    math classes daydreaming about<br>
    being on a starship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's intriguing. When Fermat died<br>
    they found scrawled in the margin<br>
    of his notes that he had found<br>
    a &quot;remarkable proof.&quot;<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Unfortunately he never lived to<br>
    write it down. And for the last<br>
    eight hundred years people have<br>
    been trying to rediscover it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And that includes you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I find the process relaxing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (changing the subject)<br>
    We've detected debris of some sort<br>
    in a loose orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you identify?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I suggest we beam a section aboard<br>
    for analysis.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so, Number One.</p>
  <p>7 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ENTERS and goes to where Riker is standing by the<br>
    platform. He nods to O'BRIEN standing at the console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> Riker explains as a piece of the debris begins to<br>
    MATERIALIZE:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've locked onto something with<br>
    markings on it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What sort of markings?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uncertain, sir.</p>
  <p> A large chunk of jagged metal MATERIALIZES on the<br>
    platform. It seems featureless, the color of brushed<br>
    aluminum. Picard is intrigued -- he touches it and<br>
    spots something as he turns it over...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's something here.</p>
  <p> Riker goes to see what Picard has found.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing; frowning)<br>
    That symbol... Do you recognize<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quietly stunned)<br>
    Yes sir. I -- I think I do.</p>
  <p>8 REVERSE ANGLE</p>
  <p> to see what they're seeing.</p>
  <p>9 MOVE IN ON THE SYMBOL</p>
  <p> a white five-pointed star on a dark blue circular<br>
    background intersected by red and white horizontal<br>
    lines on either side.</p>
  <p> It is the insignia of the United States Air Force...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> seen from a different angle, still in orbit around<br>
    Theta Eight.</p>
  <p>11 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - PICARD</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and TROI are gathered to discuss the<br>
    debris...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Metallic analysis bears out that<br>
    the object in question was<br>
    terrestrial in origin. Most<br>
    likely late twenty-first century.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But that's not possible. No ship<br>
    of that time period could have<br>
    come this far.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nevertheless, that is what our<br>
    tests indicate. And the markings<br>
    we discovered are consistent with<br>
    this hypothesis.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Any idea what destroyed it? An<br>
    explosion of some sort?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The question is, how did it get<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> Picard's train of thought is interrupted by the<br>
    INTERCOM...</p>
  <p> WESLEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain. We've detected a large<br>
    structure on the planet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON SCREEN</p>
  <p> Wesley and the others are studying the sensor readout<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a building of some sort,<br>
    situated on a plane of frozen<br>
    methane, smack in the middle of<br>
    a tremendous storm belt. It is<br>
    incongruous; it simply should not<br>
    be there!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you certain it's artificially<br>
    constructed?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Absolutely. The structure is<br>
    surrounded by breathable air.</p>
  <p> Picard steps back, taking it all in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's hard to accept...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yet it does seem to be down there.<br>
    Is there a connection between the<br>
    structure and the ship?</p>
  <p> No one seems to have an answer to this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Suggestions?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (small smile)<br>
    Only one, sir. Suggest we go down<br>
    and have a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Form an away team, minimal<br>
    complement.</p>
  <p>13 MOVE IN</p>
  <p> on a thoughtful, determined Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's see if we can find the<br>
    architects.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>14 OMITTED</p>
  <p>15 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ON DATA AND WORF</p>
  <p> checking equipment, standing on the transporter<br>
    platform. Over at the transporter panel, O'BRIEN<br>
    looks up.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Give me a moment, gents. We're<br>
    dealing with an extremely narrow<br>
    access point.</p>
  <p>16 OMITTED</p>
  <p>17 RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> steps on platform.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're ready when you are...<br>
    (then to Worf)<br>
    Phasers on stun.</p>
  <p> They adjust their phasers. Riker looks to O'Brien.<br>
    O'Brien nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> O'Brien complies, and the party of three is BEAMED<br>
    AWAY.</p>
  <p>18 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DATA, WORF AND RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> MATERIALIZE in a featureless black void. It is<br>
    completely still, no sound, no movement. The calm is<br>
    unnerving.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (tense)<br>
    Where are we?</p>
  <p> Data checks his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly where Geordi said we would<br>
    be. The structure is directly<br>
    behind us.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They all turn and look behind them. All they can see<br>
    is blackness...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am detecting vast ammonia storms<br>
    raging mere kilometers away. Yet<br>
    they do not appear to penetrate<br>
    this breathable zone.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (soft, awed)<br>
    It's like the eye of a hurricane.</p>
  <p> Data has wandered toward where he believes the<br>
    structure to be. He looks up, as though sensing the<br>
    hugeness of the thing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is here. It must be here, yet<br>
    we cannot see it.</p>
  <p>19 INTERCUT WITH PICARD ON THE MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise, this is Commander<br>
    Riker. We have arrived in a very<br>
    unusual place... it is like being<br>
    in the eye of a hurricane. It<br>
    is completely calm, no sound, no<br>
    movement, yet a few meters away<br>
    a storm, which we can neither see<br>
    nor hear, is raging.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Describe the structure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can't see it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, over here. I see<br>
    something!</p>
  <p> Data and Riker hurry over to Worf. The Klingon has<br>
    discovered an old-fashioned revolving door, seemingly<br>
    situated in the middle of nothing. It turns slowly, as<br>
    though beckoning them...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is this thing?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    What is it, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard, amazed)<br>
    I think it's a door. An antique.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Judging by its location, it may<br>
    be an entrance to the structure<br>
    we seek.</p>
  <p> The three of them exchange wary glances...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... this is what we came here<br>
    for.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Captain, we are entering the<br>
    structure.</p>
  <p> Riker cautiously steps in and the revolving door<br>
    automatically turns to the right. Riker disappears<br>
    into the darkness, and when the door stops revolving he<br>
    is gone. Worf looks at Data and then follows suit.<br>
    Data follows him...</p>
  <p>20 INT. ROYALE LOBBY - DATA</p>
  <p> steps out of the revolving door and joins the others<br>
    inside the structure. They are standing on a garish<br>
    carpet, scarlet with gold trim. All are looking around<br>
    incredulously as we HEAR THE SOUND OF A SLOT MACHINE<br>
    hitting a jackpot and the tumult of a casino in full<br>
    swing.</p>
  <p>21 ANGLE TO REVEAL THEIR WHEREABOUTS</p>
  <p> inside the lobby of a small Vegas-style hotel, roughly<br>
    our time period. To their right is a front desk beside<br>
    some elevators. To the left is a modest casino with<br>
    blackjack tables, crap tables and roulette wheels, all<br>
    flanked by a row of slot machines and a lounge with a<br>
    piano player.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> There is a bustle of activity on all sides. People are<br>
    gambling, hotel workers are scurrying about. No one<br>
    is paying much attention to the three stunned<br>
    strangers. Riker touches his communicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise. We have<br>
    entered the structure.<br>
    (then, realizing)<br>
    We're not getting through.</p>
  <p>22 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PICARD</p>
  <p> stands between Wesley and an n.d. crewmember at Conn<br>
    and Ops. Troi can be seen sitting at the Command<br>
    Section with Geordi still at the Aft Station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where's that interference<br>
    originating?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    From the source, sir. Cause...<br>
    unknown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lock onto the landing party.<br>
    Have the Transporter Room prepare<br>
    to beam them up.</p>
  <p> Geordi shakes his head as he studies the screen...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can't distinguish them as long<br>
    as they're inside that structure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can they hear us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've got to recalibrate all<br>
    frequencies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p>23 INT. ROYALE LOBBY - RIKER</p>
  <p> is touching his communicator, frustrated.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Without radio contact, we should<br>
    leave immediately.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed. We'll make a preliminary<br>
    sweep of this environment and then<br>
    return.</p>
  <p> A BELLBOY, a Latino in his mid-twenties, nervously<br>
    looks them over as if he is expecting someone else.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Checking in, gentlemen? You'll<br>
    have to go to the front desk.</p>
  <p> He indicates the front desk and then moves off before<br>
    our people can respond. What follows plays off the<br>
    point of view of Riker and the others. Riker thinks<br>
    about what he said and then heads for the front desk.<br>
    Worf and Data follow him, still looking around in<br>
    wonder.</p>
  <p> A SLIGHTLY BUILT MAN WITH PERFECT HAIR stands behind<br>
    the counter, underneath a sign that says REGISTRATION.<br>
    The name tag on his lapel reads &quot;ASSISTANT MANAGER.&quot;<br>
    He's the type of assistant manager we've all met at<br>
    one time or another: polite in a routine, impersonal<br>
    and annoying way, fastidious and slightly effeminate.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Welcome, gentlemen. Have a nice<br>
    trip?</p>
  <p> Riker looks at Worf quizzically.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uh... Do you know us?</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    We've been expecting you. A trio<br>
    of foreign gentlemen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're from the United Federation<br>
    of Planets --</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Of course. Welcome to The Hotel<br>
    Royale...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The Bellboy comes up beside the assistant manager,<br>
    interrupting:</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Did Rita call?</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    No -- and for your own good you<br>
    had better quit thinking about<br>
    Rita.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    I'm not afraid of him.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Then you're a fool. Everybody<br>
    with any sense is afraid of Mikey<br>
    D.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    (waves off the thought<br>
    of Mikey D)<br>
    If Rita calls -- you let me know.</p>

    his face in the pavement.<br>

    Now, here are your room keys and<br>
    some complimentary casino chips.<br>

  <p> Riker and Worf don't know what any of this means.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is this place? How did a<br>
    being like you get here?</p>
  <p> The assistant manager finally looks up.</p>

  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Why this is the Royale, of<br>
    course. And my personal life is<br>
    really none of your business,<br>
    thank you.</p>
  <p> He looks back down again...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What he means is, what planet<br>
    is this?</p>
  <p> The assistant manager SIGHS and faces Riker...</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    I beg your pardon?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This planet. What do you call<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    (rolling his eyes)<br>
    Earth.<br>
    (very dry)<br>
    What do you call it?</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf are stunned to hear him mention Earth.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We call it Theta Eight.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    How charming.</p>

    inhabitants.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    These beings... are they machines,<br>
    (eyes narrow)<br>
    or mere illusions, designed to<br>
    deceive us?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (studying tricorder)<br>
    Not illusions, Lieutenant. They<br>
    do exist, but they do not register<br>
    as either man or machine.</p>
  <p> Just then, a cheerful, burly, MIDDLE-AGED MAN wearing<br>
    a huge tan-colored Stetson (we'll call him TEXAS) comes<br>
    out of the elevator behind Data. The android turns<br>
    his tricorder on him...</p>

  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Look who's talkin'.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    He sounds just like my ex-wife.</p>
  <p> Texas shakes his head and mutters to himself as he<br>
    hobbles OUT OF FRAME. We can hear him BELLOW OUT as<br>
    he reaches the casino O.S.</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>

    Aaaaall right!! Time to get back<br>

  <p> are standing at the edge of the casino. We can hear<br>
    occasional SHOUTS OF ENTHUSIASM AND DESPAIR from the<br>
    gaming tables. Data quietly walks up to a table where<br>
    TWO HIGH-ROLLERS are playing blackjack surrounded by<br>
    onlookers and supporters.</p>
  <p> THE DEALER is a twenty-eight year old black man, cool<br>
    and laid back. Texas sits to his right, while VANESSA<br>
    sits to his left.</p>
  <p> Texas notices Data and motions him to come up beside<br>
    him. The dealer shuffles his decks as Texas converses<br>
    with the android, Data holding his complimentary chips<br>
    in his hand.</p>

    Sit down, boy. I'll show you how<br>
    this game is played.<br>
    (re Data's chips)<br>
    Go ahead. Ante up.</p>
  <p> Texas does just that; Data follow suit. The dealer<br>
    has just finished shuffling. He slides the deck toward<br>
    Data... and waits.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Texas, frowning)<br>
    It seems he expects something of<br>
    me.</p>

    Ah, is this poker?</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    No, it's blackjack.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Also known as twenty-one, a<br>
    number which defines the object<br>
    of the game. Tens and picture<br>
    cards are worth ten, ace -- one<br>
    or eleven -- the other cards face<br>

    eyes are diverted and he steps behind the bell<br>
    captain's stand, opens a small drawer, and pulls out a<br>
    snub-nosed .38. He checks the load, snaps the cylinder<br>

    He has been dead for two hundred<br>

    Colonel Stephen Richey was the<br>
    commanding officer of the<br>
    explorer ship Charybdis which<br>
    had a terrestrial launch date of<br>
    7-23-2067. It was the first<br>
    manned attempt to travel beyond<br>
    the confines of the Euclidian<br>
    solar system. Its telemetry<br>
    system failed and it was never<br>
    heard from again...<br>
    (then, intrigued)<br>
    Why is this of interest, Number<br>
    One?</p>
  <p> There is no com response from Riker:</p>

  <p> Data smiles, takes the paperback, stares down at it as<br>

    done, he looks up at Riker with:</p>

  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The story of a group of compulsive<br>
    gamblers caught up in the web of<br>
    crime, corruption and deceit spun<br>
    by nefarious lothario Mikey D who<br>
    appears only at the climax to be<br>
    brought to his knees by a<br>
    heartbroken bellboy. There is<br>
    a subplot about an older man<br>
    conspiring with a younger woman<br>
    to murder her husband while<br>
    squandering her inheritance. The<br>
    writing is elementary, the<br>
    plotting predictable, the<br>
    characters one-dimensional. The<br>
    only thing of interest, quite<br>
    honestly, is the intriguing<br>
    setting, that of a Las Vegas<br>
    gambling casino-hotel --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    This novel... and everyone in<br>
    it you've just described...<br>
    that's this hotel...</p>
  <p> Riker picks up the other small book now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This... this appears to be a<br>
    diary... but with only one<br>
    entry...<br>
    (reading from it with<br>
    great interest now)<br>
    &quot;I write this in the hope that<br>
    it will someday be read by human<br>
    eyes... I can only surmise at this<br>
    point, but apparently our<br>
    exploratory shuttle was<br>
    contaminated by an alien life-form<br>
    which infected and killed all<br>
    personnel except myself. I<br>
    awakened to find myself here in<br>
    The Royale Hotel... and for the<br>
    last thirty-eight years I have<br>
    survived here.<br>

  <p> RIKER (Cont'd)<br>
    &quot;I have come to understand that<br>
    this place was created for me<br>
    out of some sense of guilt,<br>
    presuming that the novel we had<br>
    on board was in fact a guide to<br>
    our preferred lifestyle and social<br>
    habits. Obviously, they thought<br>
    this was the world from which I<br>
    came. I hold no malice toward<br>
    my benefactors... they could not<br>
    possibly know the hell they have<br>
    put me through, for it was such<br>
    a badly written book, filled with<br>
    endless cliche and shallow<br>
    characters. I shall welcome death<br>
    when it comes... &quot;</p>
  <p> Riker looks up at Data and Worf, who realize:</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That would mean the atmosphere<br>
    of the planet would instantly rush<br>
    in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long would they live under<br>
    those conditions?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    A minute -- maybe less.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But you could revive them.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Well, that would depend on how<br>
    long they were exposed, how soon<br>
    I got to them, but Captain<br>
    realistically... I wouldn't give<br>
    them much of a chance. I'm a<br>
    doctor -- not a magician.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand the risk, but I will<br>

  <p> The away team is searching the room for any other clues<br>
    when the PHONE RINGS. Worf looks to the others and<br>

    separate the receiver from the rest of the phone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (into phone)<br>
    Yes?<br>
    (listens, frowns, turns<br>
    to others)<br>
    There is a female voice asking<br>
    if we want... &quot;room service.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data and Riker look at one another -- they have no idea<br>
    how to answer that question.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe they are asking if we<br>
    want the room cleaned.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tell them no.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    No.</p>
  <p> Worf listens to the response, shows surprise, and then<br>
    hangs up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What'd she say?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    She said... &quot;The kitchen's open<br>

    our minds.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data cocks his head, puzzled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> just walking into the casino. Data turns to Worf...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I suggest we separate and blend<br>

    queries offered in an<br>

    most fruitful.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Data shrugs.</p>

    Vanessa is looking more desperate, Texas more<br>
    confident, just as the dealer reveals his hole card.<br>
    Blackjack. Vanessa sags:</p>
  <p> VANESSA<br>
    How much do I have left?</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Honey, it's bad luck to count your<br>
    chips at the table...</p>
  <p> Data sits beside Texas, cocks his head.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If I might inquire, where are you<br>
    from, sir?</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>

  <p> The Dealer deals a round. Comes to Vanessa.</p>
  <p> DEALER<br>
    Hit?</p>
  <p> She slides her cards under her chips; she's pat.</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    It's out front, I suppose. What<br>
    the hell difference does it make?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Could you take me there?</p>
  <p> The Dealer reveals his hole card. Blackjack again.</p>
  <p> VANESSA<br>

    I'm losing my shirt here --</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    (ignoring her; to Data)<br>
    Now son, why would I wanna do<br>
    that? Can't you see I'm tryin'<br>
    to to help this little lady?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe you could go to<br>

    right now we're tryin' to turn<br>
    this lady's wagon and win back<br>
    some lost change. Otherwise she's<br>
    goin' to be in a desperate<br>
    situation with nowhere to turn.<br>

    Well, almost nowhere.</p>
  <p> The dealer deals again while Texas lets his hand run<br>
    suggestively down her arm.</p>
  <p>65 SCENE</p>
  <p> Vanessa looks at her cards. She's got thirteen. The<br>
    dealer has a five showing.</p>
  <p> VANESSA<br>
    I stay, right?</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    I wouldn't.</p>
  <p> The woman is so desperate now -- all her money -- what<br>
    little that's left -- is on the line.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The odds favor standing pat.</p>
  <p> Texas is confused -- it's as though no one has ever<br>

  <p> VANESSA<br>
    What do I do?</p>
  <p> The dealer is getting impatient.</p>
  <p> DEALER<br>
    You want a card or what?</p>
  <p> Vanessa looks from Data to Texas. Then she looks at<br>
    the dealer and nods &quot;yes.&quot; The dealer lays down a card -- it's<br>
    a king.</p>
  <p> VANESSA<br>
    Too many.</p>
  <p> She turns and looks at Texas.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>

  <p> VANESSA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That's everything I had. I've<br>
    lost it all. What am I going to<br>
    do?</p>
  <p> Texas puts his arm around her shoulders and pats her<br>
    gently.</p>

  <p>66 INT. ROYALE LOBBY</p>
  <p> Worf joins Riker at the registration desk. The<br>

  <p> turn to see:</p>
  <p>68 DOORWAY</p>
  <p> Through the revolving door comes a hard-looking man --<br>
    MIKEY D -- it's obvious he's got murder on his mind.</p>
  <p>69 RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> as they look from Mikey D to the bellboy.</p>
  <p>70 SCENE</p>
  <p> The bellboy moves off to the side -- he's young and<br>
    scared, but he's not the kind to back down. (All of<br>
    this has to be played through the eyes of Riker and<br>
    Worf.)</p>
  <p> MIKEY D<br>
    You were told.</p>
  <p> The bellboy nods.</p>

  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    It's not for you to make the<br>
    call... it's for Rita.</p>
  <p> MIKEY D<br>
    She sent me to tell you.</p>
  <p> Mikey moves slightly to the side -- a gunfighter looking<br>
    for an edge.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Boys -- we can't afford to have<br>
    any trouble here -- take it<br>
    outside.</p>
  <p> MIKEY D<br>
    Yeah -- I like that... come on,<br>
    baggage man... let's you and me<br>
    take it outside.</p>
  <p> The bellboy hesitates.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Watch yourself.</p>
  <p> BELLBOY<br>
    Don't worry.</p>
  <p> The bellboy moves his hand back to where he has stashed<br>
    his gun.</p>

  <p> He smiles. His hand also moves.</p>

  <p> Worf smells a firefight coming and his hand goes to his<br>

    It's all part of the novel. Don't<br>
    interfere.</p>

  <p>74 SCENE</p>
  <p> As the bellboy moves toward the door... Mikey D makes a<br>
    little circling move -- just enough to get the angle.<br>
    Without warning -- Mikey D pulls his gun and fires.<br>
    It's loud and smoky. The bellboy falls. Mikey D<br>
    quickly turns his attention on the room.</p>
  <p>75 RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> Neither moves -- they are both mesmerized by what they<br>
    are watching.</p>
  <p>76 SCENE</p>
  <p> Mikey D looks over at the bellboy.</p>
  <p> MIKEY D<br>
    You should have listened, kid<br>
    no woman is worth dying for...<br>
    killing for... but not dying for.</p>
  <p> Mikey D then turns and walks OUT of the hotel as Data<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    A bad love affair ends in a bloody<br>

  <p> She sighs heavily; Texas shoves several chips out<br>
    behind Data's and now Data picks up the dice and<br>
    awkwardly rolls them down the length of the table. The<br>
    croupier barks out:</p>
  <p> CROUPIER<br>
    Six. The point is six --</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Six! Hell, my blind grandmother<br>
    can make a six! Let 'er rip, boy!</p>
  <p> Data picks up the dice and rolls again, his face<br>

  <p> CROUPIER<br>
    Seven. Seven and out...</p>
  <p> Data's eyes widen as he sees his chips swept away by<br>

  <p> blows on the dice and rolls again and now his face<br>
    lights up with the sound of:</p>
  <p> TEXAS (O.S.)<br>
    Seven! A winner!</p>
  <p> Data's money is quickly doubled; so is Vanessa's.<br>
    They both like it.</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Attaboy! Just do that a few more<br>
    times and everybody's gonna get<br>
    well --</p>
  <p> And as Data prepares to roll again now, we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>87 THE ASSISTANT MANAGER</p>
  <p> as he walks to the table with a tray of $100,000<br>
    placques. Data has quite a crowd around him now as<br>
    he continues his hot streak.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    (to croupier)<br>
    Who has the dice?</p>
  <p> The croupier nods toward Data. At his side, Vanessa is<br>
    doing just fine, with more money in front of her than<br>
    she ever dreamed. Now, of course, Vanessa is all over<br>
    Texas like a cheap suit.</p>
  <p> VANESSA<br>
    Oh, Tex, darlin', you're<br>
    brilliant!</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Yeah. An' good lookin' too, huh?</p>
  <p> Worf studies the action, leans over to his comrades.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Isn't that enough?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Almost. I don't want to be short,<br>
    that's for sure...<br>
    (then, to Data)<br>
    You are keeping count?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data reaches down, touches the stack, pauses for a<br>
    moment, then whispers:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Eleven point three million.<br>
    (then, whimsically)<br>
    Perhaps I will bet it all --</p>
  <p> Riker leans in to him, whispering urgently:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No! Simply reach twelve million.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As you wish...</p>
  <p> With that, Data rolls one last time and we hear:</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.)<br>
    The man has the touch.</p>
  <p> The croupier shoves more chips over to Data; Riker<br>
    leans in to Data with:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to the Croupier)<br>
    I would like to cash out, please.</p>
  <p> The croupier blanches; he turns to the assistant<br>
    manager who steps up.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    I'm afraid you've broken the bank.<br>
    That's over twelve million --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Twelve point five million to be<br>
    exact. The purchase price of<br>
    this hotel.</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    That's impossible --</p>
  <p> Riker smiles, holds up the novel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wrong. We're the &quot;foreign<br>
    Investors&quot; on page 244. We're<br>
    buying you out, lock, stock, and<br>
    barrel.<br>
    (slides the chips toward<br>
    the pit boss)<br>
    Consider it a &quot;done deal.&quot;</p>
  <p> The assistant manager reacts, stupefied, not knowing<br>
    how to react. Texas turns to them, wide-eyed.</p>
  <p> TEXAS<br>
    Hey, y'know what? Y'all got<br>
    style! I like that! Let me buy<br>
    y'all a drink --</p>
  <p> Riker smiles at him, reaches into Texas's coat pocket<br>
    and pulls out a big cigar. As he twirls it in his own<br>
    mouth:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Enjoy the game, friend. And don't<br>
    let 'em change the dice on you.</p>
  <p> With that, Riker leads Worf and Data away through the<br>
    crowd. The assistant manager, sweating nervously,<br>
    shouts out:</p>
  <p> ASSISTANT MANAGER<br>
    Wait! You can't leave!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh yeah? Watch us.<br>
    (then, wagging a finger<br>
    at him)<br>
    Don't forget, we own the joint.</p>
  <p> Riker leads them toward the revolving door in the<br>
    distance. Worf looks a bit worried, puffs himself up,<br>
    anticipating a struggle with strange physical elements<br>
    beyond his ken.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You're confident about this,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Focus. Concentrate. See only<br>
    where we want to BE, not where<br>
    we are.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ancient philosophical overtones<br>
    of thought process... &quot;Zen&quot;, I<br>
    believe --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We own the place... and we're<br>
    walking through that door...</p>
  <p>88<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    91</p>
  <p>91A ANGLE - THE REVOLVING DOOR</p>
  <p> And as they approach the door, we see each of our away<br>
    team members steel himself for the impossible... and<br>
    they step into the revolving door and we:</p>
  <p> GO TO:</p>
  <p>92 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - THE BLACK VOID</p>
  <p> envelops them once again. Riker smiles confidently as<br>
    he intones:<br>
    RIKER<br>
    I think it's time to go home...</p>
  <p>93 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - PICARD</p>
  <p> smiles in relief as he hears those words. He turns to<br>
    his crew.<br>
    PICARD<br>
    Transporter Room, we have a fix<br>
    on our away team. Beam them up...<br>
    and please be quick about it!</p>
  <p> Troi comes over to his side and shares his moment of<br>
    relief as:</p>
  <p>93A EXT. PLANET SURFACE - THE AWAY TEAM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEAMS UP and:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Royale&quot; - 01/10/89 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>93B THE REVOLVING DOOR</p>
  <p> continues its perpetual motion as we:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
