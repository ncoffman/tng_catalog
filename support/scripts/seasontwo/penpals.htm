  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving along at warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42680.3.<br>
    We are the first manned vessel<br>
    to enter the Selcundi Drema<br>
    quadrant. Previous unmanned<br>
    probes have recorded unusual<br>
    levels of geological activity<br>
    in all five planetary systems.<br>
    I am hoping the Enterprise will<br>
    find the answer to this engima.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER is in the command position. WORF and DATA are at<br>
    their respective stations. Supernumeraries at other<br>
    positions.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, I have been reviewing<br>
    the unmanned probe scans. In the<br>
    past one hundred and fifty years,<br>
    the fifth planet of Selcundi Drema<br>
    has shattered, forming an asteroid<br>
    belt.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd call that geological<br>
    instability.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is there any indication that this<br>
    is the work of an unknown<br>
    intelligence?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - REV. 2/13/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think this is geology, not<br>
    malevolence. These planets live<br>
    fast and die hard. The question<br>
    is why.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD and TROI come walking down the corridor toward<br>
    the Holodeck doors. He is dressed for riding in<br>
    breeches, high boots, sweater. Hunt cap beneath his<br>
    arm, gloves, whip.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're sure you won't reconsider?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, I'll watch you and be<br>
    impressed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    An optimistic vote of confidence<br>
    from the non-rider.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've never thought of you as<br>
    particularly an animal person.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Small animals, no, but horses --</p>
  <p> They reach the Holodeck doors, and he steps to the<br>
    computer panel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Computer, program Holodeck for<br>
    a woodland setting with a bridle<br>
    path and an appropriate mount.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Type of mount? Andorian Zabathu,<br>
    Klingon Sark --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (impatiently)<br>
    A horse, an Earth horse.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Breed?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/21/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Arabian.<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    The Arabs believed that Allah<br>
    gathered the south wind and made<br>
    the horse.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    On the Holodeck we've made that<br>
    legend come true.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I like that. Oh yes, computer,<br>
    English tack, and I will control<br>
    the animal myself.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> The doors open, and there is the scene. The horse,<br>
    already saddled and bridled, stands quietly in a glade<br>
    in the trees tethered to an old-fashioned horse head<br>
    hitching post. Picard and Troi ENTER.</p>
  <p>3A EXT. MEADOW</p>
  <p> Picard and Troi cross to the horse, and Picard allows<br>
    it to smell his hand. He rubs her between the eyes,<br>
    and straightens the forelock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello, my beauty.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    So you like horses for the<br>
    romance?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It goes deeper than that. A fine<br>
    war mare would sleep in a<br>
    bedouin's tent, carry him into<br>
    battle, feed his children with<br>
    her milk. There is a bond which<br>
    forms from mutual need.</p>
  <p> Picard inspects a forefoot.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Now I understand. You don't want<br>
    the comfort of a pet. You want<br>
    a companion.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - 2/10/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She reflects for a moment, looks a little wistful.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I had a Betazoid kitten once. My<br>
    mother and the cat reacted...<br>
    badly to one another.</p>
  <p> She pauses as if considering how to phrase the words.<br>
    Then decides to just say it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, my mother and I share<br>
    a bond. She is going through a<br>
    difficult time, and I may need<br>
    to be with her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you want leave, you need only<br>
    ask.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Thank you, sir, I appreciate that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (indicating the horse)<br>
    You're sure you won't try? It's<br>
    a good way to relax. We can get<br>
    you something quiet and gentle.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, no. I prefer a mode of<br>
    transportation that doesn't have<br>
    a mind of its own.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Strange. I should have thought<br>
    that Betazoids would be<br>
    outstanding animal trainers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We become too involved in the<br>
    thoughts and shifting passions<br>
    of the beast. We lose our way<br>
    and become swept up in<br>
    emotionalism.</p>
  <p> Picard checks the girth and the length of the<br>
    stirrups.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - 2/10/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I should think the shifting<br>
    passions of...<br>
    (he taps his chest)<br>
    ... this beast would be<br>
    far more terrifying.</p>
  <p> Picard gathers up the reins and prepares to mount.<br>
    Then RIKER'S COM VOICE interrupts.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've entered the first system.<br>
    I think you might want to come<br>
    to the bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something interesting?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Spectacular and a little<br>
    terrifying.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (he pats the horse's<br>
    neck)<br>
    Later, old girl.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf and Data at their stations. Picard ENTERS<br>
    (back in uniform). On the main viewscreen is the image<br>
    of a planet that is in the throes of a violent<br>
    geological upheaval. The various tectonic plates are<br>
    outlined in red as if the planet is literally tearing<br>
    itself apart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is our first long-range<br>
    reading, extremely high<br>
    magnification.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Quite impressive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - 2/10/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And deadly. The last unmanned<br>
    probe showed a thriving<br>
    ecosystem. Now there's nothing.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> moving on impulse power.</p>
  <p>6 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Present are Picard, Riker, and GEORDI. Troi and<br>
    PULASKI ENTER and look to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is Commander Riker's meeting.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I need your advice and<br>
    recommendations. I was given the<br>
    responsibility of overseeing<br>
    Wesley's education. To further<br>
    that goal I want to put him in<br>
    command of the planetary mineral<br>
    surveys.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    This is a big job with a lot of<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The game's not big enough if it<br>
    doesn't scare you a little.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To do the job, Wesley's going to<br>
    need a team. It takes command<br>
    presence to lead. Is he ready<br>
    for that?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Leadership grows from<br>
    self-confidence which is also<br>
    part of a Starfleet officer's<br>
    education.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All of this is true, but there<br>
    is an old horse trainer's adage<br>
    about putting too much weight on<br>
    a young back -- we don't want him<br>
    to break under the pressure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - REV. 2/13/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We seem to be shifting the focus<br>
    here. Are we talking about a<br>
    young officer on the fast track<br>
    to the Academy or are we talking<br>
    about guiding a young man through<br>
    adolescence and into adulthood?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Both.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You can't guide someone into<br>
    adulthood. The experiences are<br>
    unique to each person. Whether<br>
    Wes succeeds or fails, he will<br>
    learn from the experience.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I agree. I'm just questioning<br>
    the speed at which we're moving.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You think we're pushing him too<br>
    hard?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    It's a valid concern.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tempering is done in extremes.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's a boy, not a sword.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who will someday be a man and<br>
    need a fine edge that will hold,<br>
    that won't dull at the first<br>
    touch of resistance.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sooner or later he's got to feel<br>
    the burden of command.</p>
  <p>6A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Worf has the bridge; he is seated in the captain's<br>
    chair. WESLEY is at Ops.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - 2/10/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Mister Crusher to the Observation<br>
    Lounge.</p>
  <p> Wesley rises, and we follow him up the ramp toward the<br>
    Observation Lounge doors.</p>
  <p>6B INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Wesley ENTERS. He checks slightly when he sees this<br>
    array of brass all staring at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wesley, I'm placing you in<br>
    command of the planetary mineral<br>
    surveys.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Sir! Um... thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You may not thank me once you see<br>
    how much work it entails.<br>
    Assemble your team, and take a<br>
    look at the records on the Drema<br>
    quadrant. We've got a mystery<br>
    to solve here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, sir. A team, sir?</p>
  <p> Riker just nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, this is a serious<br>
    responsibility.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    These officers are here to assist<br>
    you. Not judge, but help. I<br>
    suggest you use them; they are<br>
    a valuable resource. And by the<br>
    way, I have more respect for an<br>
    officer who knows when to admit<br>
    ignorance and ask a question than<br>
    one who, out of pride, will<br>
    blunder blindly forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - REV. 2/14/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I understand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're dismissed, Mister Crusher.</p>
  <p> Wesley starts to leave, then turns back and looks from<br>
    Riker to Picard.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I'll try not to disappoint you</p>
  <p> Picard merely grunts noncommittally.</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data is running scans at Science One. The area around<br>
    his feet is cluttered with a CRT screen, a panel at his<br>
    feet is open, and a circuit board is out. Worf steps<br>
    gingerly through the mess.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is this part of your regular<br>
    duties?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, a personal project. I have<br>
    just reset the sensors to scan<br>
    for frequencies outside their<br>
    usual range.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Such as?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The dips and peaks of the galaxy's<br>
    magnetic field, organic molecules<br>
    in nebular clouds, energetic<br>
    cosmic rays.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Interesting. Would these scans<br>
    also detect artificial<br>
    transmissions as well as naturally<br>
    occurring signals?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - Rev. 2/22/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Those signals are very faint and<br>
    difficult to distinguish from<br>
    background noise, which is why<br>
    I am boosting the power.</p>
  <p> Worf starts back to his station, crashes into a pile<br>
    of isolinear chips, and almost takes a header over the<br>
    control board.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I will be removing this equipment<br>
    to my quarters.</p>
  <p> Worf is not happy. He glowers, and snarls out:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Good!</p>
  <p>8 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Troi and Riker are walking together. They cross an<br>
    intersection, and Wesley spots them. He runs to catch<br>
    up, a PADD gripped hard in one hand.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi, may I walk with you? I need<br>
    a little advice.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And it's free.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Walking or advice?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Both.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It's about my team. I'm<br>
    considering so many factors I'm<br>
    confusing myself.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What have you done so far?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; - Rev. 2/22/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Broken down the task and picked<br>
    the best people in those<br>
    disciplines.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who have you got so far?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Prixus for mineralogy and<br>
    metallurgy, Alans and Hildebrant,<br>
    volcanology and geo-mechanics,<br>
    and I want Davies for geo-chemistry,<br>
    but --</p>
  <p> Wesley breaks off. They stop walking, and Riker and<br>
    Troi wait for a beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But they're all older than<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yeah, it makes me feel awkward.<br>
    And what about compatibility --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Completely irrelevant. They're<br>
    professionals. And if there are<br>
    personality conflicts, you resolve<br>
    them. You're in charge.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    So you not only have to understand<br>
    the job, you have to be a ship's<br>
    counselor.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sometimes.</p>
  <p> Wesley looks at them both for an instant, then nods.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, thanks.</p>
  <p> He walks away and they watch him go.</p>

    We are entering the second<br>

    the volatility of these planets<br>
    originated in the primordial gas<br>

    in a chair and examines a rock sample, runs one of our<br>
    ever-useful black boxes across it. It VANISHES in a<br>
    flare of rainbow colors. The doors open, and Wesley<br>
    ENTERS. He is brisk and confident.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've been put in charge of the<br>
    planetary survey, and I'd like<br>
    to have you on the team.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    Sounds great. Who else is on it?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Prixus and Hildebrant and Alans.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    It's a shame you didn't talk to<br>
    me first. Personal opinion, but<br>
    I like to break up married teams.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh, I hadn't thought about that.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    Don't worry, they'll probably work<br>
    out fine.</p>
  <p> Wesley starts for the door.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And if you need any help, just<br>
    give me a signal and I'll take<br>
    over for you. We don't want you<br>
    getting too beat up on your first<br>
    command.</p>
  <p> The tone is kindly, but Wesley's confidence is being<br>
    slowly eroded by all the good advice and kindly<br>
    protection. He sounds much younger now than when he<br>
    entered the room.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi, Doctor Pulaski.</p>
  <p> His eyes keep sliding to the door.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Is there trouble behind that door?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    My team's in there. I've got to<br>
    assign planets, set a schedule.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Sounds like you've got everything<br>
    under control.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But I haven't had to deal with<br>
    them. Not all together. Not<br>
    professionally.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Wes, the minute you walk through<br>
    that door they're your team. You<br>
    don't have to prove a thing.<br>
    You've got the authority.</p>

  <p> Picard crosses to the already saddled horse and strokes<br>
    her neck, straightens the mane, scratches her neck.</p>

    the horse and rocks into a canter.</p>
  <p> Cantering away from the camera, slowing to a walk.<br>
    Picard leans forward and pats the horse on the neck.</p>
  <p> There should be no pass-by's because he is functionally<br>
    on a treadmill; or, if there is a ride-by, the horse<br>
    should be bent around Patrick's leg as if they are in<br>

  <p> Davies is busy at a table. Wesley and HILDEBRANT stand<br>
    before a screen.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I agree. Nice job.</p>
  <p> Hildebrant nods and moves away. Davies rises and<br>
    crosses to Wesley carrying a PADD. He's friendly but a<br>
    little off-handed.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    Here are the results of my scan<br>
    of the third Selcundi system.<br>
    Just the same old song.</p>
  <p> Wesley takes the PADD and checks the information.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Didn't you tell me that U.V.<br>
    absorption readings like these<br>
    are indicative of traker deposits?</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    And where there's traker there's<br>
    generally dilithium? Yeah, I did.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Then don't you think we ought to<br>
    run an Ico-spectrogram?</p>

  <p> DAVIES<br>
    Those tanker readings are really<br>
    faint. It's probably a fool's<br>

  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (hesitantly)<br>
    I think I'd still run the<br>
    Ico-gram.</p>
  <p> Hildebrant has been drawn by the discussion.</p>
  <p> HILDEBRANT<br>
    Wesley, it's a major undertaking<br>
    to set up that scanner.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    We're looking at five hours -- minimum.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I know, I just don't want to do<br>
    the job halfway.</p>
  <p> DAVIES<br>
    Wes, there's being thorough and<br>
    then there's wasting time. It's<br>
    also the mark of a good officer<br>
    to recognize the difference.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, maybe you're right.</p>
  <p> Davies and Hildebrant move away.</p>
  <p> And OUT OF CAMERA RANGE.</p>
  <p> BACK ON Wesley looking uncomfortable with the<br>
    implication that he's picking nits and not really in<br>
    command. We see him struggle with himself; Wesley has<br>
    the expression of a man who doesn't feel good about a<br>
    decision, but can't figure out what to do about it.</p>

  <p> Picard dismounts and flips the reins over the horse's<br>

    Quite all right. It must be<br>
    important, or you wouldn't be<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain, it is important.<br>
    Very. Eight weeks ago I received<br>
    a transmission -- a simple four<br>
    word message: &quot;Is anybody out<br>
    there?&quot; I answered it.</p>

    Merde. Just where does she think<br>
    you're calling from?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have kept that somewhat vague.<br>
    But Sarjenka has been quite<br>
    specific, telling me detailed<br>
    stories of her family and friends.<br>
    It was fascinating, but among<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    Will you excuse me?</p>

  <p> Wesley and Riker seat themselves.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Yesterday Ensign Davies turned<br>
    in his survey results. I thought<br>
    he should run an Ico-spectrogram.<br>
    He didn't agree.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Did you think you were right?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, yeah, I guess. Or I could<br>
    have just been picking nits.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Or perhaps intimidated? It's<br>
    tough to tell people what to do.</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I suppose I could have made it<br>
    an order, but that's the hard<br>
    part. How do I give orders to<br>
    somebody older and more<br>
    experienced then me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Your and Davies's relative ages<br>
    aren't the issue here. Are they?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I guess not.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Do you think it might have<br>
    something to do with ego?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Maybe the opposite of ego. Every<br>
    time I give an order, there's this<br>
    part of me that's asking what<br>
    makes my judgment so superior to<br>
    this other person's.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wes, authority and responsibility<br>
    go hand in hand. I know you're<br>
    responsible, now you have to learn<br>
    to handle authority. You've been<br>
    put in command so you can make<br>
    a few right decisions. That will<br>
    establish a pattern of success<br>
    and build your self-confidence.<br>
    That's why I said this was about<br>
    ego. If you don't trust your own<br>
    judgment, you don't belong in the<br>
    command chair.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But what if I'm wrong?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you're wrong. It's arrogant<br>
    to think you'll never make a<br>
    mistake.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But what if it's something really<br>
    important -- not just a mineral<br>
    survey, and what if someone ends<br>
    up dead because of my mistake?</p>

    In your situation you only have<br>
    to do one thing: Ask yourself,<br>

    He'd listen to all the opinions,<br>
    then make the decision. But he's<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doesn't matter. Would anyone<br>
    argue with the captain once his<br>
    decision was made?</p>
  <p> Wesley gives a bark of incredulous laughter.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (a little sharply)<br>
    I've always had a problem with<br>
    that kind of abstract<br>
    intellectualizing. It seems very<br>
    callous and even a little<br>
    cowardly.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the &quot;cowardly,&quot; and Picard holds out a<br>
    quelling hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, I'm sure the lieutenant<br>
    did not intend it in that way.<br>
    In this situation we must use<br>
    caution. Our actions could have<br>
    a profound effect upon the future.<br>
    If we could see all possible<br>
    outcomes --</p>
  <p> Picard pauses searching for the right words. Riker<br>
    jumps in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We would be gods, but we're not.<br>
    If there is some cosmic plan,<br>
    isn't it the height of hubris to<br>
    presume that we can, or should,<br>
    interfere?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So what are you saying? That the<br>
    Dremans are fated to die?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's something that needs to be<br>
    considered.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (with heat)<br>
    Well, consider it considered, and<br>
    rejected.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If there is a cosmic plan, are<br>
    we not part of it? Our presence<br>
    at this place at this moment in<br>
    time might be part of that fate.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    So it might be part of the plan<br>
    that we interfere.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think that eliminates the idea<br>
    of &quot;fate.&quot;</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Commander, remember &quot;Human<br>
    reason needs only to will more<br>
    strongly than fate, and she is<br>
    fate.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor, you quote Thomas Mann,<br>
    and Commander Riker could no doubt<br>
    cite Euripides to support his<br>
    position, but all of this is just<br>
    philosophy. Sarjenka is not a<br>
    subject for philosophical debate,<br>
    she is a person.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    He's got a point. The Prime<br>
    Directive was designed to protect,<br>
    not destroy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    So Doctor, you draw the line at<br>
    the death of millions.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Same situation if it's an epidemic<br>
    rather than a geological<br>
    catastrophe?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How about a war? A<br>
    generations-long conflict that<br>
    is killing millions. Do we<br>
    interfere?</p>
  <p> There is an uncomfortable silence.</p>

    is that what you're saying, Mister<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> Data just stares at him. Picard stares into those<br>
    too-wide eyes. It's like kicking a dog. He drops his<br>
    head into his hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p>32 INT. SARJENKA'S ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data MATERIALIZES. A lurid red light is filtering<br>
    through the hexagonal cells of the comb-like room. The<br>
    transmitter lies on the floor. Occasional tremors<br>
    shake the room. On one side of the room is a raised<br>
    platform covered with tumbled furs. In one corner<br>
    is propped a lute-like instrument. Brightly colored<br>
    ribbons hang from the neck. On one wall hang a<br>
    number of pictures. They are all of improbable ships<br>
    sailing through the stars or winged creatures flying<br>
    through stars, ringed planets, etc. All the detritus<br>
    of childhood, but no child.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/16/89 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data unlimbers his tricorder and takes readings. The<br>
    tricorder is emitting HIGH-PITCHED BEEPS which DROP<br>
    IN TONE as it scans across the door areas of the walls.</p>
  <p> Data approaches a doorway and runs a hand across it.<br>
    The wall VANISHES, and he is looking out at a volcano<br>
    which is spurting molten lava high into the sky. A<br>
    river of the viscous rock crawls toward the house.<br>
    Ash is raining down outside. Data closes the wall.</p>
  <p> Slowly he crosses and picks up the lute. An earth<br>
    tremor shakes the room. Data steadies himself. He<br>
    thoughtfully draws his fingers across the strings.<br>
    The SOUND of the strings hang in the room.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the wall VANISHES, and...</p>
  <p> SARJENKA rushes in. The wall remains open. She is<br>
    an eerie but beautiful child between ten and twelve.<br>
    Her skin has a luminous gold color; her eyebrows have<br>
    a metallic quality as if gemstones and precious metals<br>
    had been crushed and brushed across the hairs. From<br>
    above each brow spring delicate antennae which curve<br>
    back over the top of her head. The hair which hangs to<br>
    her waist is of the same metallic multicolored strands<br>
    as the brows. The quality is as if a dragonfly<br>
    developed bipedally. Eyes can be faceted or not. She<br>
    is coughing.</p>
  <p> Data turns. She freezes when she sees the Android,<br>
    then shrinks back in terror.</p>
  <p> She bolts for the exit. Data leaps after her and grabs<br>
    her by the shoulders.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sarjenka, wait!</p>
  <p> She struggles violently in his grasp.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Do not be afraid. I am Data.</p>
  <p> She stares at him in dawning wonder. Slowly she<br>
    reaches out and touches his cheek with her fingertips.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    (breathing the word)<br>
    Data.<br>

    Data, where have you been?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is no time for explanations.<br>
    You and your family must leave.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    We already have. We ran when the<br>
    tremors began.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (confused)<br>
    Then why are you here?</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    My father wouldn't let us take<br>
    anything, but I had to have my<br>
    transmitter. I knew you would<br>
    come back, and I didn't want you<br>
    to find only silence -- the way<br>
    I did.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (distractedly)<br>
    Yes, well, I am sorry about that,<br>
    but it is very complicated -- Does<br>
    your family know where you are?</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (looking outside)<br>
    You cannot survive in this.</p>
  <p> Data closes the wall, and suddenly the little girl<br>
    begins to realize that she is in danger. Fright washes<br>
    across her face.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    What are we going to do?</p>
  <p> Data considers. There is another tremor, and Sarjenka<br>
    almost loses her footing. Data steadies her. He has<br>
    evaluated all the available information and there is<br>
    only one alternative. He taps his insignia.</p>

    There's gonna be hell to pay.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You're going to take that?</p>
  <p> Data pauses to consider.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Leave her here?</p>
  <p> Sarjenka seizes his arm, stares in fear at O'Brien<br>
    and in a frenzied whisper:</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    Don't leave me here. Please don't<br>
    leave me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

  <p> Riker, Picard, Troi, Wesley and Worf are all at their<br>
    accustomed places. A supernumerary at Ops. The planet<br>

    Sir, we are three minutes from<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Where is he?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He'll be here.</p>
  <p> Right on cue the doors of the aft turbolift open.<br>
    Picard and Riker rise and turn. Riker's expression<br>
    of relief turns to consternation as he and Picard stare<br>
    at the child with Data. Picard very slowly turns his<br>
    head to regard his first officer. There is a world<br>
    of frustration in the glance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He has brought that child aboard<br>
    my ship and onto my bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure Data will have a very<br>
    good explanation.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She was frightened and did not<br>
    want to be left alone</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, would you kindly<br>
    assume your station.</p>
  <p> Picard nods to Troi and gestures toward Sarjenka.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Counselor, escort her to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> Troi starts up the ramp, and Sarjenka shrinks even<br>
    closer to Data. She is in a very strange place, among<br>
    strangers who look hideously ugly to her, and there<br>
    is this gruff man who is angry with her and angry with<br>
    her friend Data.</p>

  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    NO!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I will not allow her to<br>
    be in the way.</p>
  <p> Sarjenka is beating at Troi's hand as Troi reaches for<br>
    her and twining around Data like vines on a tree. Data<br>
    is very rattled by this. Everyone's attention is on<br>
    this little psychodrama and not on their stations.</p>

    shrill)<br>
    NO! Leave me alone! I want Data!</p>
  <p> Troi catches one of Sarjenka's flailing hands. Troi<br>
    continues murmuring soothing endearments, but Sarjenka<br>
    is having none of it. She bursts into wild sobs.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Counselor, allow me. Please.</p>
  <p> Troi drops Sarjenka's hand and steps back, watching<br>
    with great interest. Data drops to one knee. The<br>
    little girl wraps her arms around his neck, rests her<br>
    head on his shoulder, and sobs. Data's eyes are<br>
    flicking from side to side, his head is cocking as<br>
    waves of confusion break over him. Suddenly his arms<br>
    go around her, and he hugs her close. With one hand<br>
    he strokes her long hair.</p>

    silent.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take your station, Mister Data,<br>
    and keep her with you. This does<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Hello, dear.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    Hello.</p>
  <p> Her eye is caught by the Singer Stone, and she picks it<br>
    up. It begins to sing, and her eyes widen in wonder.<br>
    She smiles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/14/89 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What is this?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    An Elanin Singer Stone. It sings<br>
    a different song for each person.</p>
  <p> Sarjenka thrusts the crystal at Data.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    What does it sing for you?</p>
  <p> He folds her fingers back around the stone and pushes<br>
    it away gently.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It does not sing for me.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Because I am a machine.</p>
  <p> SARJENKA<br>
    Oh Data, I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> She touches his cheek.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Sarjenka, we're going to run a<br>
    few scans just to make sure you're<br>
    all right.</p>
  <p> An expression of alarm crosses the child's face.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data's going to be right with you.<br>
    Don't worry.</p>
  <p>35A INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Pulaski lead Sarjenka to the biobed, and Data<br>
    boosts her up. Pulaski gives her a hypospray, and the<br>
    little girl is out. Pulaski begins studying the<br>
    readouts over the bed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/14/89 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>35A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You did a good thing, Data.</p>
  <p> He looks down at Sarjenka.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/16/89 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>35A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But are we doing a good thing now?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Data, this is to protect her as<br>
    much as us.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    By robbing her of her memories?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    To remember you and this ship<br>
    would complicate her future. She<br>
    has to be the person she was born<br>
    to be. And you'll remember.</p>
  <p> Pulaski sets up a complex machine. It emits a beam of<br>
    blue light across the child's head.</p>
  <p>36 INT. SARJENKA'S ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data MATERIALIZES. He is carrying Sarjenka. (Stunt<br>
    double if necessary.) Data carries the sleeping child<br>
    to her bed and tucks her in. He then opens his hand,<br>
    revealing the Elanin stone. It is silent. He then<br>
    presses it into her hand, gently folding the fingers<br>
    around the crystal. It begins to sing. He crosses<br>
    to the wall and opens it, revealing the now quiet<br>
    volcano. There are anxious VOICES OFF STAGE. Data<br>
    quickly closes the wall, hurries to the center of the<br>
    room, touches his insignia and DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p>37 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp speed.</p>
  <p>38 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is in the command position. Worf is at his<br>
    station. Supernumeraries at Conn and Ops. Wesley<br>
    ENTERS and starts to cross to his station. Riker<br>
    motions to him, and Wesley joins him at the command<br>
    station. He nods toward the first officer's chair.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sit down.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/21/89 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    No thank you sir. It's going to<br>
    be a long time before I'm really<br>
    qualified to sit here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You did a good job, Wes. I'm<br>
    proud of you.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Wesley starts for Conn, then pauses and looks back.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Does it get any easier?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No.</p>
  <p>39 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> There is a CHIME. Picard looks up from book. In the<br>
    background music is softly playing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS. Picard closes the book on a finger.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I came to thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No thanks are necessary. You<br>
    reminded us that there are<br>
    obligations beyond duty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Pen Pals&quot; -- REV. 2/16/89 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You did not have to hold that<br>
    conference. Your decision could<br>
    have been unilateral.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One of my officers...</p>
  <p> He stops, and sets aside the book.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... One of my friends was in<br>
    trouble. I had to help him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am going to miss her, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That too is part of friendship,<br>
    remembrance and regrets.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And understanding that has taken<br>
    you a step closer to humanity.</p>
  <p> Off Data's quizzical look.</p>
  <p>39A EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moving away at ways speed</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
