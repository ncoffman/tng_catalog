    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42881.5.<br>
    We are in orbit around Antede<br>
    Three, awaiting the arrival of<br>
    two dignitaries from this world.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR - ON PICARD</p>
  <p> walking toward us, wearing a full-dress uniform.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our mission is to carry them to<br>
    a conference on planet Pacifica...</p>
  <p>3 TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he the Transporter Room with DOCTOR PULASKI, WESLEY<br>
    and WORF, all of whom wear work uniforms.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... where their race will be given<br>
    the opportunity to join the<br>
    Federation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I thought you might find this<br>
    interesting, Mister Crusher. Few<br>
    humans have ever seen an Antedian<br>
    in the flesh.</p>
  <p> Picard nods at TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN who begins<br>
    the energizing process. The two delegates begin to<br>
    MATERIZLIZE on the platform...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 REVERSE ANGLE ON ANTEDIANS</p>
  <p> as seen from behind. They are dressed in flowing, red<br>
    robe-like garments with an attached hood which keeps<br>
    us from seeing their heads from here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    captain of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (hesitates, then)<br>
    Are they alright, Captain?</p>
  <p> Doctor Pulaski moves toward them with a medical instrument<br>
    in hand. She grimaces as she gets near their faces.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, this is their preferred way<br>
    of space travel.</p>
  <p>5 ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE ANTEDIANS</p>
  <p> seen from the front for the first time. It is not a<br>
    pretty sight. Each mottled face resembles an oversized<br>
    catfish: huge gaping mouth, spindly whiskers, big fish<br>
    eyes, and a skeletal structure that gives them a<br>
    grotesque, unhealthy appearance. Their hooded, crimson<br>
    robes only emphasize their eerie, menacing appearance.<br>
    But what is really bizarre is that they're completely<br>
    motionless -- catatonic. A medium-sized container<br>
    arrives with them.</p>
  <p> Pulaski methodically runs her medical instruments along<br>
    the Antedian's necks.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Their physical condition appears<br>
    good enough, considering the<br>
    circumstances.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Welsey)<br>
    It is a self-induced catatonic<br>
    state. Their way of dealing with<br>
    the trauma of spaceflight.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Will we try to revive them?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not until we reach the Pacifica<br>
    conference. It's three days away.<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    You've prepared Sickbay facilities<br>
    for holding them, Doctor?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    As soon as we make some<br>
    adjustments. Their physiology<br>
    is unusual.<br>
    (to O'Brien)<br>
    Can you store them for a few<br>
    hours?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Aye. I'll have them kept out of<br>
    the way here.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    What's in this container?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Their food. When they come out<br>
    of stasis, they will be very<br>
    hungry.</p>
  <p>5A ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Wesley steps over to the container and lifts the cover.<br>
    It's filled with a writhing, squirming mass of<br>
    worm-like creatures.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    This is what they eat?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In great quantities.</p>
  <p>5B SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Provide security.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Understood, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf steps forward and looks at the Antedians<br>
    admiringly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>5B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What a handsome race.</p>
  <p> The others look at Worf, wondering if he could possibly<br>
    be serious. And of course, he is.</p>
  <p>5C EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as she leaves orbit.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The normal bridge crew are in their positions. Troi<br>
    is also there.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What did you think of the<br>
    Antedians, Wesley?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Well, they are rather<br>
    strange-looking, Commander.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS and walks to his position.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Judging a being by its physical<br>
    appearance is the last great human<br>
    prejudice, Wesley.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A point well taken. I'm sure<br>
    that to the Antedians, we're<br>
    equally unattractive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is interesting to consider just<br>
    how subjective &quot;beauty&quot; truly<br>
    is...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... we're being hailed by<br>
    a small transport vessel just<br>
    coming into range.</p>
  <p>7 ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI</p>
  <p> As she suddenly stiffens.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, my God!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is the problem?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What can she be doing here?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    On the screen, Captain.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where the pilot of the shuttle is seen. He appears<br>
    to be a bit weary and nervous.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORT PILOT<br>
    Starship Enterprise, come in!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have you on our viewer, Pilot.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TRANSPORT PILOT<br>
    Enterprise... I have a passenger<br>
    -- a V.I.P. passenger -- who I'm<br>
    ordered to --</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI (V.O.)<br>
    Let me talk to them, Pilot. I'm<br>
    much more articulate.</p>
  <p> The transport pilot seems relieved to step aside and<br>
    let the woman speak for herself.</p>
  <p>9 MOVE IN ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as MRS. TROI slides into the picture.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother!</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, we are now receiving<br>
    Starfleet orders granting a<br>
    Lwaxana....</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the<br>
    Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred<br>
    Chalice of Riix, heir to the Holy<br>
    Rings of Betazed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... full ambassadorial status,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm afraid it's back into your<br>
    formal uniform, Captain.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And yours too, Commander. She<br>
    is listed as representing the<br>
    Betazed government at the<br>
    conference.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mother, please don't do this to<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Do what to you, Little One?<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Oh, what naughty thoughts,<br>
    Jean-Luc. How wonderful you still<br>
    think of me in that way.</p>
  <p>10 ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> looking at one another resignedly, preparing for the<br>
    worst.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>11 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD, RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> as they ENTER, Picard and Riker now in formal full<br>
    dress. The Antedians, still catatonic, have been moved<br>
    to the side where a SECURITY GUARD stands with them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's so like my mother to do the<br>
    unexpected. She's famous for it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It will be nice to have her as<br>
    a guest of the Enterprise again.</p>
  <p> Riker exchanges a look with Picard signifying some<br>
    reservations. Picard turns to Transporter Chief<br>
    O'Brien.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Mrs. Troi beams in. She is apparently kneeling on<br>
    the platform, hunched over and facing backwards...</p>
  <p>13 CLOSE ON MRS. TROI</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (opening her eyes)<br>
    Aaagh! Where are my legs?!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where they belong, Mother, Right<br>
    under you.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi begins standing up.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (offhand)<br>
    Oh, wonderful. So they are!<br>
    (turning to Picard)<br>
    But I'll never completely trust<br>
    this device, Jean-Luc...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's &quot;Captain Picard,&quot; Mother...</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi has turned to where she suddenly sees the<br>
    &quot;frozen&quot; Antedians.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Aaagh!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker, resignedly)<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry they startled you, Mrs.<br>
    Troi. These are Antedian<br>
    delegates... ah, temporarily being<br>
    stored here, I believe...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    &quot;Delegates?&quot; The last time I saw<br>
    something like this, it was being<br>
    served on a plate.</p>
  <p> Picard has to turn away to hide his smile at this. But<br>
    Riker enjoys it openly, especially her next line.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But you, Jean-Luc, I was not aware<br>
    you had such handsome legs. My<br>
    valet is waiting. You may beam<br>
    him aboard now.</p>
  <p> Picard nods at the Chief O'Brien and in a second, a<br>
    larger figure MATERIALIZES. MISTER HOMN arrives carrying<br>
    Mrs. Troi's &quot;suitcase&quot;. He breaks into that easy,<br>
    enigmatic smile of his as he looks around the room.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You remember Mister Homn, of course.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be hard to forget Mister<br>
    Homn. Welcome back to the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Homn nods toward Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I've retained his services despite<br>
    the outlandishly lustful thoughts<br>
    he spews in my direction. I<br>
    suppose the poor fellow just can't<br>
    help himself.</p>
  <p> It's hard to believe Homn would lust after anyone.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing; to Picard)<br>
    Perhaps you could show me to my<br>
    suite now?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Certainly.</p>
  <p> Mister Homn starts to pick up her luggage...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Put that down, Homn. We can't<br>
    deny the captain the honor of<br>
    carrying my belongings.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at the beehive-shaped carrying-case. He<br>
    remembers the last time...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I won't interfere with Homn's<br>
    duties this time.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    That's not the real reason,<br>
    Jean-Luc. You forget I'm a<br>
    telepath.</p>
  <p> Picard looks from Mrs. Troi to Deanna as Homn picks<br>
    up the luggage...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Look, since this apparently has<br>
    some meaning to you, Mrs. Troi,<br>
    I'll...</p>
  <p> Riker reaches in to take the luggage from Homn.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ...carry...it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Homn has released the luggage and the full weight of<br>
    it (with a MUFFLED CLANKING SOUND) is taken by Riker,<br>
    whose words have come out in a surprised GROAN.</p>
  <p>14 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The others follow Riker who is trying his best to<br>
    &quot;casually&quot; carry the heavy bag down the hallway.<br>
    Picard, the Trois and Homn follow closely behind.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (trying not to sound<br>
    labored)<br>
    It's... just down this hall.</p>
  <p>15 EMPHASIZING THE TROI WOMEN</p>
  <p> Deanna is glaring at her mother who is looking at<br>
    Riker's legs.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (telepathic)<br>
    He has nice legs too, Little One.<br>
    Is he still yours?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (telepathic)<br>
    Humans no longer own each other<br>
    that way, Mother.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Oh really?<br>
    (looks at Picard)<br>
    That's a custom we may have to<br>
    introduce again.</p>
  <p>16 INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the Group ENTERS and Riker puts down the baggage,<br>
    SIGHS with relief.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Glad I could help out.</p>
  <p> Riker and the others EXIT, leaving Picard to face Mrs.<br>
    Troi alone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I trust you'll be comfortable<br>
    here, Mrs. Troi. Now if you'll<br>
    excuse me, I must get back to my<br>
    duties.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Captain, I will be serving a<br>
    Betazoid dinner of greeting<br>
    tonight. It is an ambassadorial<br>
    function.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (after a hesitation)<br>
    Of course. It, uh, sounds<br>
    delightful.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS. Mrs. Troi speaks of him as she flutters<br>
    about, checking out the intricacies of her quarters...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    He's a fine man. Solid. Earnest.<br>
    Reliable. Perhaps a little on<br>
    the dull side, but all in all he's<br>
    not bad.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I cannot believe you! You sound<br>
    like you're sizing up a commodity.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    But that's exactly what men are,<br>
    darling. Especially human men.<br>
    (chuckles, strokes<br>
    Deanna's face)<br>
    Was your father ever unhappy with<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, he worshipped you, Mother.<br>
    But I'll never learn to see men<br>
    the way you do.</p>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You will as you mature, darling.<br>
    And the males in your life will<br>
    bless you for it.</p>
  <p>17 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER, WESLEY, WORF, DATA</p>
  <p> Most of them are LAUGHING, except Data who is smiling<br>
    slightly. Even Worf seems almost amused.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    ... but it's true she complimented<br>
    Captain Picard on his legs?</p>
  <p> Riker nods affirmative.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would have thought a telepath<br>
    would be more discreet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, it's just the opposite. She<br>
    knows what's in your mind and she<br>
    lets you know what's on hers.</p>
  <p> More LAUGHTER -- which is suddenly stilled as they<br>
    realize that Picard ENTERED the bridge. Picard takes<br>
    his seat at command and speaks in a tone that's polite,<br>
    yet gets the point across -- enough of this<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We must not lose sight of the fact<br>
    that we're talking about someone<br>
    who has been granted ambassadorial<br>
    rank. Even if she appears a bit<br>
    eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be<br>
    treated with appropriate respect.<br>
    Is that understood?</p>
  <p> The others make it clear that it is.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our orders on her mentioned<br>
    nothing specific except...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (waits)<br>
    Except what, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are to cooperate with her as<br>
    fully as possible, deliver her<br>
    there untroubled, rested...<br>
    (seeing Picard's<br>
    expression)<br>
    I assume those were merely<br>
    courtesies due her rank, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    See that every bridge officer and<br>
    supervisor has the full text of<br>
    that transmission.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to Pulaski. When was the<br>
    last time you looked in on our<br>
    Antedian guests?</p>

  <p>20 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CLOSE ON PULASKI</p>
  <p> intently concentrating on reexamining the Antedians.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm doing so right now, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Are they still catatonic?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Status of the beings is unchanged.<br>
    Pulse still steady -- respiration<br>
    normal for them.</p>
  <p>21 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - SAME SETTING</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood. Keep me informed --<br>
    Picard out.</p>
  <p> Picard leans back in his chair, takes a deep breath,<br>
    and then rises.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe I'll get some rest.<br>
    (exiting; to Riker)<br>
    It will be a dress uniform dinner,<br>
    gentlemen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir?</p>
  <p> But PICARD EXITS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Inquiry, Commander: to which<br>
    dinner was the captain referring?</p>
  <p> Riker ponders the question.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nothing I've been invited to.<br>
    Have any of you?</p>
  <p> Apparently no one has.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Very interesting!</p>

  <p>23 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - PICARD</p>
  <p> (back in formal dress) walks down the hallway with a<br>
    bottle of ice-blue Altairian brandy in his right hand.<br>
    As he rounds a corner he comes face to face with Doctor<br>
    Pulaski, going the other way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're not attending the dinner<br>
    with us this evening, Doctor?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I've already eaten, Captain. But<br>
    thanks anyway.</p>
  <p> We HEAR A CHIME.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI (V.O.)<br>
    (sing-song)<br>
    Come in!</p>
  <p> The expression on Pulaski's face is interesting.</p>
  <p>24 INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD</p>
  <p> ENTERS to find romantic lighting, with candle-like<br>
    objects spread about the room, and a small table made<br>
    up for two. Mrs. Troi is out of sight in an adjoining<br>
    room; Mister Homn is filling expensive-looking glasses<br>
    with what looks like wine.</p>
  <p> Picard holds out the bottle -- Homn accepts it... and<br>
    then to Picard's surprise, he unscrews the top and<br>
    begins to drink straight from the bottle. Picard<br>
    starts to say something, but thinks better of it. In<br>
    a matter of moments, Homn drains the entire bottle!</p>
  <p> The giant smiles at Picard and bows regally -- his way<br>
    of saying thanks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me Mister Homn, when will the<br>
    others be arriving?</p>
  <p> Homn stares back blankly.</p>

    The other officers?<br>
    (pause)<br>
    Commander Riker? Deanna?</p>
  <p> Homn shakes his head from side to side and smiles<br>
    mischievously. He points a long finger at Picard and<br>
    then points behind the Captain. Picard turns to see...</p>
  <p>25 MRS. TROI</p>
  <p> leaning against the wall, wearing a sexy dress and a<br>
    provocative look.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (purring)<br>
    Hello, Jean-Luc. So glad you<br>
    could come.</p>

  <p> this is not what he expected...</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>27 INT. MRS TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi and the captain are seated at the little<br>
    table, about to begin their meal. Their glasses are<br>
    full and Homn is serving them a colorful Betazoid<br>
    salad.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (raising glass)<br>
    A toast: to Earthmen... who<br>
    despite their faults, have a<br>
    unique ability to charm women of<br>
    all races, in all corners of the<br>
    galaxy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (clinks glass)<br>
    Speaking for the men of Earth,<br>
    which is an awesome responsibility<br>
    indeed, I thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard is attempting to be light and uncaring, but<br>
    underneath the surface, this candlelight dinner is<br>
    making him uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (teasing, flirting)<br>
    I know what you're thinking,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a bit worried)<br>
    You do?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You're wondering if I've been<br>
    seeing any other man on a serious<br>
    basis.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (shaking head)<br>
    Well actually I wasn't --</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    -- I wouldn't worry about it,<br>
    Jean-Luc.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI (Cont'd)<br>
    (reaches out, touches<br>
    his hand)<br>
    Competition seems to bring out<br>
    the best in the human male.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles weakly and subtly withdraws his hand to<br>
    lift his glass to his lips.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I must admit, I wasn't expecting<br>
    this... setting. I assumed that<br>
    my high-ranking officers would<br>
    also be attending.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Never assume anything when it<br>
    comes to Lwaxana Troi. A Betazoid<br>
    woman is full of surprises.</p>
  <p> Not knowing just what to say, Picard begins to pick at<br>
    his food, but Mrs. Troi seems to be waiting for<br>
    something. Behind her, Mister Homn, sipping a drink, has<br>
    just taken his place next to a big, circular chime near<br>
    the far wall.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Strange, I'm not that hungry<br>
    tonight.<br>
    (leans forward, coy)<br>
    I wonder what's making me lose<br>
    my appetite? Any ideas?</p>
  <p> She smiles and extends a utensil toward her blue salad.<br>
    Homn downs his drink and makes ready. She takes a<br>
    bite, Homn STRIKES THE CHIME. Picard jumps at the<br>
    SOUND.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh yes, you're giving thanks for<br>
    your food. I'd forgotten about<br>
    that.<br>
    (pause)<br>
    I wonder how many other cultures<br>
    have similar customs.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I don't know.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    Commander Data.</p>

  <p>30A INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE ONE - DATA (INTERCUT AS NEEEDED)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Troi and I are having a very<br>
    interesting discussion about the<br>
    various ways by which societies<br>
    give thanks. For instance, the<br>
    Betazoids use of the chime.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The use of the chime is unique,<br>
    but not at all dissimilar to the<br>
    Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who<br>
    use two large stones which are<br>
    continuously struck during the<br>
    meal. Those at the dinner must<br>
    eat until the stones are broken.<br>
    Or, the oligarchy on Atifs Four,<br>
    which require a young male to...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Commander, this is absolutely<br>
    fascinating, don't you agree, Mrs.<br>
    Troi? Data, if your duties<br>
    permit, why don't you join us for<br>
    dessert?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are forgetting sir -- I do not<br>
    digest foodstuffs, therefore I<br>
    cannot participate in the<br>
    consumption of your post-main<br>
    course edibles.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    What'd he just say?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO 19A.</p>
  <p>30A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't have to eat to join us,<br>
    Commander. I'm sure Mrs. Troi<br>
    would simply enjoy the pleasure<br>
    of your company.</p>
  <p> Data is pleased to hear it...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed, sir. I am on my way; Data<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>30A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (annoyed)<br>
    How could you possibly think I'd<br>
    want to share our special time<br>
    together, with that robot of<br>
    yours?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because... because of his<br>
    wonderful after-dinner<br>
    conversation. His anecdotes are<br>
    the stuff of legends aboard this<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>31 INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Data, now sitting at their table, eagerly<br>
    concluding an &quot;anecdote&quot;.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    -- So by using the square root<br>
    of pi and then multiplying it by<br>
    nine to the third power, I was<br>
    able to accurately calculate the<br>
    distance between the Omicron<br>
    galaxy and the Crab Nebula.</p>
  <p>32 PULL BACK TO INCLUDE PICARD AND MRS TROI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> She is literally bored stiff by Data's stories. In<br>
    the b.g. we see Mister Homn break into a slow, cat-like<br>
    yawn.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fascinating, Data. I'm sure Mrs.<br>
    Troi would love to hear the one<br>
    about the, uh, anomalous chemical<br>
    composition of... say... brown<br>
    dwarf stars.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Well, not really --</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (enthused)<br>
    -- Yes Captain, that is a<br>
    particularly spellbinding subject.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data turns to Mrs. Troi with a pleased, eager look on<br>
    his face.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    For most stars, the rare-Earth<br>
    element Europium is enriched<br>
    relative to samarium and<br>
    gadolinium...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (flat, bored)<br>
    Is that so?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is! However in brown dwarf<br>
    stars, the element Europium is<br>
    anomalously depleted.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Fascinating.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But that is only the beginning.<br>
    If the abundances of the elements<br>
    terbium, dysprosium, holmium and<br>
    erbium are also factored into the<br>
    analysis...</p>
  <p>33 INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - TROI AND PULASKI</p>
  <p> are walking together.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Your mother seems quite an<br>
    interesting woman, Deanna.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Doctor, perhaps I should tell you<br>
    something about my mother's<br>
    condition at this time.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Condition at this time?!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Something that occurs to Betazoid<br>
    females at mid-life. We call it<br>
    the Phase.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>33 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    At mid-life as in the human<br>
    female's menopause?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    Almost the exact opposite. It<br>
    is only at mid-life that Betazed<br>
    females become... well, fully<br>
    sexual, if you know what I mean.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Yes, perhaps I do. I just heard<br>
    her voice fairly singing when she<br>
    called the captain into her room.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I wonder if I shouldn't warn the<br>
    captain?</p>
  <p> Pulaski considers it. Is there a gleam of amusement<br>
    in her eyes?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Nooo. As ship's doctor I'd<br>
    consider it excellent exercise<br>
    for his reflexes and agility.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (somewhat shocked)<br>
    Doctor... !</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    In staying ahead of your mother.</p>
  <p> Troi suddenly understands, smiling.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. An animal is always at its<br>
    best when hunted...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Or when hunting.</p>
  <p>34 STAY ON DEANNA</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    ... and at this point, the second<br>
    co-orbital satellite avoids a<br>
    collision with the first.</p>
  <p> MRS TROI<br>
    (looking up)<br>
    -- Deanna, darling! Thank the<br>
    Four Dieties you're here.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I hope I'm not interrupting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (rising)<br>
    No, as a matter of fact, I need<br>
    to get back to the bridge myself.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps I should stay here and<br>
    further entertain our guest.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    -- No! I mean, I think you're<br>
    needed on the bridge as well.</p>
  <p> Data frowns... then nods, realizing she's probably<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a bit stiff)<br>
    Thank you for a delicious meal.<br>
    Let's uh, do it again sometime.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (purring)<br>
    Oh, I know we will.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS (followed by Data) a little embarrassed.<br>
    Deanna looks at her mother with hard, accusing eyes.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Little One, the captain is every<br>

    Data, you'll never know just how<br>
    much I owe you for that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Indeed, Captain? I know many more<br>
    interesting anecdotes as well.</p>
  <p>37 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE CAPTAIN AND DATA</p>
  <p> EXIT the turbolift and ENTER the bridge. Riker swivels<br>
    from his position at Command, and addresses Picard,<br>
    still in dress uniform, who is moving toward the Ready<br>

    Pacifica, it seemed the<br>
    appropriate thing to do.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't be absurd -- you knew what<br>
    this would lead to...</p>
  <p> Deanna trails off as she looks at Homn (she doesn't<br>

    I have it completely under<br>

    What stage is it in?</p>

    Well, far enough along for me to<br>

    Now I know why you wore that<br>
    dress.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (laughing)<br>
    Don't be ridiculous. It's just<br>
    a simple little dress -- there's<br>
    nothing provocative about it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (more to herself)<br>
    What are we going to do?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I'm going to do the only honorable<br>
    thing there is to do.<br>

    And I'd say the captain has the<br>
    inside track.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>

    your mother's accuracy leaves much<br>
    to be desired.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Actually, her telepathic prowess<br>
    is quite advanced. Except for<br>
    now.</p>

    &quot;Except for now?&quot;</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't misunderstand me, Counselor.<br>
    Your mother is a beautiful<br>
    person...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    My mother is just beginning a<br>
    physiological phase... one that<br>
    all Betazoid women must deal with<br>
    as they enter mid-life.</p>
  <p> Troi stops talking and looks at the men. The men look<br>

    When a Betazoid female goes<br>
    through &quot;the Phase,&quot; it quadruples<br>

    that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't want to frighten you.<br>

    My mother has opted for the only<br>
    dignified course of action open<br>
    to her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Isolation?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    She has chosen to focus all of<br>
    her sexual energy on one male.<br>
    This man will eventually become<br>
    her husband, of course.<br>
    (with difficulty)<br>
    It seems Captain, that you are<br>
    the early favorite.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Congratulations, sir!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am not amused, Number One.<br>
    (starts pacing again)<br>
    There must be a way to convince<br>
    her that it's quite impossible<br>
    -- without offending her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You cannot apply human style logic<br>
    to this, Captain.<br>

    Mother would be shocked and deeply<br>
    resentful, should you spurn her<br>
    advances. She would naturally<br>
    take it very personally.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, considering Starfleet's<br>
    orders not to get her upset, I<br>
    think it might be prudent for me<br>
    to make myself less available for<br>

  <p> Picard walks toward the glass door with &quot;his&quot; name on<br>
    it. He moves slowly, relishing the detail in the<br>
    decrepit hallway.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It was a grey day in the city by<br>
    the bay. My pockets were as empty<br>
    as a press agent's heart. I<br>
    needed a case, that's for sure,<br>
    but the private dick racket was<br>
    as slow as the horse I just blew<br>
    my last two bucks on.</p>
  <p>46 INT. DIXON HILL'S RECEPTION ROOM - PICARD</p>
  <p> ENTERS and finds his SECRETARY behind the desk...</p>

    (pleased)<br>
    Hello, it's good to see you again.</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    (chuckling)<br>
    You're too much, Dix. You make<br>
    it sound like you ain't seen me<br>
    in a year.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles to himself, she's close to right. He<br>
    removes his hat and coat, as she pulls out a small<br>
    notepad...</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    You got two calls...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    New cases?</p>

    Your tailor called -- he wants<br>
    his dough for cleaning your other<br>
    suit -- and your landlord called -- you<br>
    can guess what he wants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    I see... Well, pay the tailor and<br>
    stall the landlord.</p>
  <p> He walks into his office. The secretary swivels her<br>
    chair and picks up the phone...</p>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>

    Ship's business takes precedence<br>
    over me?</p>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Hmmm... Oh well, he was too old<br>
    for me anyway.</p>
  <p> Still thinking, she moves over to where Homn is happily<br>
    sampling several tall glasses of multi-colored liquids.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (to Homn)<br>
    Homn, let's consider my alternate<br>

  <p> Homn bows deeply -- his way of saying &quot;good idea.&quot;</p>

  <p> sitting with his back to the door, hands clasped behind<br>

    behind him...</p>
  <p> SECRETARY (V.O.)<br>
    (a little nervous)<br>
    There's a gentleman here to see<br>
    you, Mister Hill.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Madeline.</p>
  <p> The secretary steps aside and then EXITS as SLADE<br>
    BENDER, a huge, bull-necked, square-shouldered tough<br>
    guy in an expensive gangster suit ENTERS. Finally,<br>
    Picard swivels his chair around and faces his visitor.<br>
    He rises slowly, awkwardly lights a cigarette (chokes<br>
    on it), and deliberately sizes up Slade Bender...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, as the book said, everything<br>
    about you is big: big<br>
    shoulders... big neck... big<br>
    fists...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Slade interrpts, speaking with little emotion, slurring<br>
    his words in a half-whisper.</p>
  <p> He's the dumb, silent type.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    You a private dick?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Says so on my door, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    I want you should do a job for<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me guess -- you want dance<br>
    lessons.</p>
  <p> Slade grabs Picard by the arm.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    (sincere)<br>
    You're not trying to be funny are<br>
    you? I don't like funny things.</p>
  <p> Picard is feeling some pain from Slade's crushing grip.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... yes, I understand that.<br>
    No funny things.</p>
  <p> Slade releases Picard's arm and the captain flexes and<br>
    unflexes cramped muscles.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    I want you to find a missing<br>
    person.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Alva? Let's see -- I'll bet she's<br>
    your sister...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to Slade's expression.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    Yes. She's my sister, and I want<br>
    you to find her!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Slade's gotten all worked up again -- he's grabbing<br>
    Picard by the shirt to get his point across.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take it easy, Mac! I can't take<br>
    the job of finding Alva if you<br>
    break me like a matchstick.</p>
  <p> Slade seems to think that over and ultimately agrees.<br>
    He releases his vice-like grip.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing;<br>
    straightening tie)<br>
    As a matter of fact, I knew who<br>
    Alva was all along. I've read<br>
    the book.</p>
  <p> Slade hovers over Picard again.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    Read what book? Are you being<br>
    funny again?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Slade)<br>
    You got a picture?</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    Of Alva?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course of Alva! The novel<br>
    wasn't illustrated.</p>
  <p> Slade is again puzzled but reaches into his shirt<br>
    pocket, and hands Picard a photograph.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I believe the 1940 expression was<br>
    &quot;hubbah, hubbah, hubbah.&quot;</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    And I still say you talk funny.<br>
    I don't like funny talk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's part of the cost of hiring<br>
    a private eye like me, Slade.<br>
    I'm very different from most you<br>
    could get.</p>
  <p> Picard looks up at Slade, then back at the photo.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>
    I want you to find Alva. I'll<br>
    pay you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Okay. I'll find Alva for you;<br>
    but you might not like what I<br>
    find.</p>
  <p> Slade simply nods, and then turns and walks out the<br>
    door. Picard calls after him and follows. Slade<br>
    continues out the reception door and into the hallway.<br>
    As Picard passes his startled secretary, he comments to<br>
    her with a smile:</p>
  <p> PICARD (CONT'D)<br>

  <p>51 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - WESLEY AND WORF</p>
  <p> are standing before the platform, looking up at the<br>
    still motionless Antedian delegates.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Even in this state, they possess<br>
    a certain dignity, a graceful<br>
    countenance.</p>

    If you say so, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (peers at him)<br>
    I see. Is this how you felt when<br>
    you first saw me?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (pause, guiltily)<br>
    Well... maybe at first.<br>
    (brightening)<br>
    But now that I've seen a few more<br>
    Klingons, I know that you're real<br>
    handsome, for... for a Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf GRUNTS, not sure he likes that compliment.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That uh, didn't come out quite<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Mrs. Troi ENTERS, followed of course<br>
    by Mister Homn. She looks up at the Antedians and<br>
    shudders...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I still say they'd look better<br>
    in sauce.<br>
    (moves closer;<br>
    concentrating)<br>
    No, nothing.<br>
    (to Welsey)<br>
    When will the good captain revive<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Not until we reach Pacifica,<br>
    ma'am.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi turns her attention from the Antedians to<br>
    Worf and Wesley. She walks around them in a slow<br>
    circle -- Homn follows, two steps behind.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You seem a fine boy. One day you<br>
    will grow up to be a big, strong<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT THREE 37.</p>

  <p> Wesley looks over at Worf, wondering what she's getting<br>
    at.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But even though humans age far<br>
    more rapidly than Betazoids, I<br>
    cannot afford to wait for you to<br>
    mature.</p>
  <p> This confuses Wesley even more. Mrs. Troi eyes Worf...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    But you... your innermost thoughts<br>
    are primal, savage. I like that<br>
    in a man.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not a man.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Which is in your favor, men so<br>
    often being irrational and<br>
    egotistical.<br>
    (eyes him, then sighs)<br>
    But I'm afraid I've grown<br>
    accustomed to human companionship.<br>
    It's nothing personal, you would<br>
    have made a fine choice.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns -- he is about to ask her what she's<br>
    talking about when she turns to her valet...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Who's next, Mister Homn?</p>
  <p> Homn puts his hands to his eyes and pantomimes the<br>

  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Ah yes. Let's get to it, I'm not<br>
    getting any younger.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi EXITS, Homn bows to Wesley and Worf, then<br>
    follows.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>

    Lieutenant La Forge, I wish to<br>
    be direct with you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (turning to see her)<br>
    I prefer it that way. Now what<br>
    are you being direct about?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I have decided to give all the<br>
    bridge officers an equal<br>
    opportunity to gain my favor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Ah, but you don't, and that's the<br>
    problem. I wonder whether a<br>
    sightless man could ever<br>
    appreciate great beauty.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's funny... I've always had<br>
    the same doubts about the sighted.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Odd. How so?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Because my eyes don't seduce my<br>
    mind, I'm driven to find beauty<br>
    in other things -- things sighted<br>
    people tend to ignore. The lovely<br>
    temperature gradiations of bodies,<br>
    the moisture patterns, the<br>
    indications of inner peace and<br>
    harmony...</p>

    You know it's wonderful to need<br>
    money.</p>
  <p> SLADE<br>

    You'll get more when you find<br>

  <p> leaning against the wall between Picard and the office.<br>
    A fedora is tilted down over one eye making his face<br>
    hard to see. He's looking down, lighting a cigarette.<br>
    Picard pauses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's see... I must have been<br>
    skimming pages about here. What<br>
    part did you play?</p>
  <p> The man doesn't look up. Picard shrugs, saunters<br>
    past; the man immediately moves up behind him, sticking<br>
    a concealed gun against his back.</p>
  <p> TOUGHGUY<br>
    Freeze.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, yes, of course.</p>
  <p> TOUGHGUY<br>
    I'm looking for Slade Bender,<br>
    Hill. I understand he was here<br>
    yesterday.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My, my, time does fly in the<br>
    Holodeck.</p>
  <p> Hands up, Picard turns slowly and gets a look at his<br>
    assailant. The Toughguy has olive skin, a jagged scar<br>
    on his cheek and oddly pale eyes...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Even if I happen to know a Slade<br>
    Bender, why should I help you?</p>
  <p> TOUGHGUY<br>
    Because he owes me money. And<br>
    because if you don't, I'll blow<br>
    your head off.</p>
  <p> A slow, cool smile spreads across Picard's face...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I knew you'd say something like<br>
    that. Marvelous.</p>
  <p> The Toughguy is really ticked off by Picard's<br>
    unfathomable (to him) remark. He jams the gun against<br>
    Picard's ribs...</p>

    he is or so help me, I'll plug<br>
    ya!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't think so.</p>
  <p> With lightning quickness, Picard throws a classic<br>
    punch, knocking his adversary reeling.</p>
  <p> The Toughguy swings about, shoves his gun into Picard's<br>
    belly, FIRES. On Picard's look of astonishment:</p>

  <p> The hood is staring in disbelief at Picard.</p>
  <p> TOUGHGUY<br>
    Come on, drop! I shot ya.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, the gun misfired. Thankfully<br>
    the Holodeck is handling it<br>
    correctly and the mortality<br>
    failsafe is functional.</p>
  <p> The Toughguy suddenly swings his gun, catches Picard on<br>
    the side of the head. It is a real blow which hurts.<br>
    But Picard pulls the hood up by his tie, and knocks<br>
    him out with a chopping overhand right.</p>
  <p>60 CLOSER - PICARD</p>
  <p> He rubs the side of his head, finds blood there.</p>

    almost too accurate.</p>
  <p> Dixon Hill's secretary has come running out, having<br>
    heard the shot. She immediately spots the blood on the<br>
    side of Picard's head.</p>
  <p> SECRETARY<br>
    Dixon, you're hurt!</p>
  <p> Picard grimaces in fine fashion...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't worry about it.<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I'm going out for a drink.</p>
  <p> Dixon Hill's secretary looks on admiringly as her boss<br>
    literally shrugs off his wound and EXITS the hallway.</p>

  <p>61 INT. REX'S BAR - ON REX</p>
  <p> the tough-eyed Bartender who owns this dark, moody bar.<br>
    The place is almost empty: a SAILOR sits next to a<br>
    BLEACHED BLOND at the bar, a COUPLE OF HARD DRINKERS<br>
    are at tables in the back. The jukebox is playing A<br>
    MOURNFUL FORTIES TORCH SONG, and Rex is pouring scotch<br>
    into the glass of a CHINESE-AMERICAN CUSTOMER...</p>
  <p>62 ANGLE ON THE DOOR</p>
  <p> as Picard ENTERS. He looks around, affection in his<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p>63 WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Rex spots Picard at the door.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    Well hello, Dixon. Haven't seen<br>
    you in a while.</p>
  <p> Picard approaches the bar...</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's it been, four hours?</p>
  <p> Picard sticks out his hand and smiles...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must be Rex. Am I right?</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    If you gotta ask me that pal, you<br>
    need a drink.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sitting at bar)<br>
    You're right, I do need a drink.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    The usual?</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (macho)<br>
    So? I've got plenty more where<br>
    that came from.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    (sincere)<br>
    Geez, Dix. You're tough as<br>
    nails.</p>
  <p> Picard belts down his drink and almost turns green.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Uggh, I'm going to have to get<br>
    used to that.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    (dry)<br>
    Yeah, it's only your third one<br>
    today.</p>
  <p> Picard is still reeling from the drink. He closes his<br>
    eyes and raps his fist on the bar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    I didn't just stroll up, dear.<br>

    PATRONS now...</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    ... So she says &quot;Rex, when are<br>
    you gonna sell the bar and get<br>
    a real job? Make a shoe, mend<br>
    a fence, do something useful?&quot;<br>
    Can you believe that, Dix?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's hard to believe, Rex.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    She just doesn't understand the<br>
    service I perform here. My<br>
    regulars depend on me to pour and<br>
    listen, listen and pour. I'm like<br>
    some kind'a psychologist to you<br>
    guys, am I right?</p>
  <p> Both men are looking down now and shaking their heads.<br>
    Rex starts to pour again, but stops as he sees someone<br>
    coming up behind Picard. Soon the captain is also<br>

  <p> Data stops for a moment and demonstrates a tough/cool<br>
    mannerism -- a classic &quot;Cagney hitch&quot;.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    For example, this is a gesture<br>
    denoting confidence and physical<br>
    prowess. It is effective in<br>
    attracting females and frightening<br>
    off would-be adversaries.</p>

  <p> Mrs. Troi saunters over and sits down -- still looking<br>
    around the room with clear distaste.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I'm surprised you let this part<br>
    of the ship get this dirty.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (indicating Riker)<br>
    Actually, that's the first<br>
    officer's job.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Well, as a matter of fact...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Relax, Commander. You have begun<br>
    making your true feelings clear.<br>
    Obviously you feel unable to<br>
    handle me.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    Anyway, why would a beautiful<br>
    high-class lady like yourself...<br>
    (indicates Riker)<br>
    ... want to hook up with a mug like<br>
    that? You're too good for him,<br>
    if you ask me.</p>
  <p> She leans across the bar and smiles...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    I couldn't agree more.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    So... what'llitbe, Doll?</p>
  <p> Her attention is completely on the bartender.<br>
    Something about him interests, then fascinates her.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    You are a most interesting person.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    You're not so bad yourself. In<br>
    fact, you're as much class as this<br>
    joint's ever seen.</p>
  <p> He pulls out an opened bottle of house wine.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    Here -- on the house. It's<br>
    French... well, almost.</p>
  <p> She turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    This is the most remarkable man.<br>
    I have never met anyone quite<br>
    like him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't suppose you have.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    He's strong. I feel no thoughts<br>
    from him... nothing. I've never<br>
    known a man so able to keep his<br>
    true feelings completely hidden.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's because...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    No man has ever been such a<br>
    mystery to me. I usually know<br>
    their thoughts before they do.</p>
  <p> REX<br>
    But not me, huh?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    No. And I never realized how<br>
    erotic that could be. Carry my<br>
    beverage to that table... we have<br>
    some things to talk about.</p>
  <p>81 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as they watch Mrs. Troi walk over to the table. Rex<br>
    picks up the glass of wine, gives Riker and Picard a<br>
    little knowing wink, and heads for the table.</p>
  <p>82 RIKER AND PICARD</p>
  <p> watch with amusement as Rex joins Mrs. Troi at the<br>
    table and they begin a very intimate conversation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Should we tell her?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it's only fair, but let's<br>
    allow her the moment.</p>
  <p> Riker has to smile. As we GO TO:</p>
  <p>83 INT. SICKBAY - PULASKI AND WORF</p>
  <p> react with completely different expressions as</p>
  <p>83A THE ANTEDIANS</p>
  <p> awake, quite agitated, trembling as they squeak with:</p>
  <p> ANTEDIANS<br>
    Food-food-food-food-food--</p>
  <p>83B PULASKI</p>
  <p> quickly realizes what must be done:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Worf! The vermicula!</p>
  <p> Worf picks up the scoop net, and digs into the tank,<br>
    coming up with a load of writhing vermicula. The<br>
    Antedians see it, and tremble with joy as Worf holds<br>
    the net out for them and they gobble it up while...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    (touching communicator)<br>
    Pulaski to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p>84 INT. REX'S BAR</p>
  <p> Picard is still with Riker</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PULASKI COM VOICE<br>
    Our passengers are on their feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I had better get to the bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 60A.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What's their condition?</p>
  <p> PULASKI COM VOICE<br>
    Hungry.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges with a nod. Riker EXITS.</p>
  <p>85 ANOTHER ANGLE BAR</p>
  <p> Picard crosses to the table occupied by Rex and Mrs.<br>
    Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Coming, Mrs. Troi?</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Not just yet. Tell William I'm<br>
    sorry... but Rex and I are<br>
    getting married.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>85 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Troi, your government expects<br>
    us to deliver you to the<br>
    conference and I intend to do<br>
    that!</p>
  <p> Mrs. Troi considers it, nods and rises, patting Rex on<br>
    the cheek.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Duty calls, darling. I'll be back<br>
    for you later.</p>
  <p>86 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard and Mrs. Troi walk toward the exit.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There is something about Rex I<br>
    think you had better know...</p>
  <p> The rest of the conversation is lost as the doors close<br>
    behind them.</p>
  <p>87 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around blue Pacifica.</p>
  <p>88 INT. CORRIDOR AT THE TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> as it opens and Mrs. Troi EXITS, followed closely by<br>
    Deanna and Mister Homn (who is effortlessly carrying her<br>
    suitcase). Mrs. Troi leads the way down the corridor<br>
    at a brisk pace, in a bad mood.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Imagine -- allowing me to go on<br>
    like that with a simple bartender<br>
    who doesn't even exist!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Mother, you always say you like<br>
    new experiences.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>89 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - THE TROI ENTOURAGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> arrives to find the Antedians on the platform and<br>
    Picard, Riker, Data and Worf there to see them off.<br>
    She indicates the Antedians...</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Why are they still here?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We thought that since you're going<br>
    to the same conference, you might<br>
    like to beam down with the other<br>
    delegates.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (casually)<br>
    They're not delegates. Those two<br>
    are assassins.</p>
  <p> ANTEDIAN FEMALE<br>
    That is... an outrage!... Lies!<br>
    We demand you... transport at<br>
    once!</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Oh honey, don't bother to deny<br>
    it. Your minds are so<br>
    unsophisticated -- I can read your<br>
    thoughts in my sleep.<br>
    (to Picard, offhand)<br>
    The inside of their robes are<br>
    lined with ultritium. Highly<br>
    explosive and virtually<br>
    undetectable by your transporter.</p>
  <p> Data is already aiming his tri-corder at their robes...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    She is correct, sir. I am<br>
    detecting large amounts of<br>
    ultritium.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    Of course you are. They planned<br>
    to blow up the entire conference.</p>
  <p> Worf has drawn his phaser.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Take them to level five. Disarm<br>
    them and hold for questioning.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Manhunt&quot; - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf leads the angry Antedians away -- they hiss at<br>
    Mrs. Troi as they pass by. Mrs. Troi gives Deanna a<br>
    hug and steps onto the platform, followed of course by<br>
    Homn.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (sighing)<br>
    Oh well, I didn't find a mate but<br>
    I saved the conference as well<br>
    as your reputations. All in a<br>
    day's work I suppose.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good-bye Mrs. Troi... and thank<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> She closes her eyes and nods her head, showing she's<br>
    ready. Picard signals the transporter chief and Homn<br>
    and Mrs. Troi begin to DEMATERIALIZE. Suddenly she<br>
    opens her eyes and looks right at Picard.</p>
  <p> MRS. TROI<br>
    (scolding, excited)<br>
    Jean-Luc! Shame on you for<br>
    thinking such a thing!</p>
  <p> And they're gone. All eyes turn to Picard...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
