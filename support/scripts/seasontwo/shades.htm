  <p> in orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p>2 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY</p>
  <p> GEORDI is moving through some underbrush.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    I'm over here, Geordi.</p>
  <p>3 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Geordi rounds a bend and comes upon RIKER who is<br>
    frowning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something jabbed me in the<br>
    calf...</p>
  <p> Riker inspects his leg. There's a spot of blood.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (touches his<br>
    communicator)<br>
    O'Brien -- Commander Riker's been<br>
    injured -- lock on and bring him<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Stand by.</p>
  <p> Riker protests:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, it's just --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/1/89 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (finishes it)<br>
    A scratch. Right. Sorry,<br>
    Commander, but we can't take any<br>
    chances. We're the first survey<br>
    team to set foot on this planet...<br>
    we don't know what the risks are.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN inputs the coordinates but when he attempts to<br>
    beam them up, an ALARM SOUNDS on the console.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY</p>
  <p> Geordi impatiently touches his communicator.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What's the hold up, O'Brien?</p>
  <p>6 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> O'Brien is working on his control panel.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The transporter has detected<br>
    unidentified microbes in<br>
    Commander Riker's body.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Can't the biofilters screen them<br>
    out?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Apparently not.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY</p>
  <p> As Geordi and Riker listen.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Doctor Pulaski has been notified.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Riker treats it lightly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/3/89 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I didn't want to leave just yet,<br>
    anyway.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> PULASKI is now present with full medical kit. O'Brien<br>
    is filling her in, showing her a readout on the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Here's the biofilter's analysis<br>
    of the microbes.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Not much to go on...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I can override and beam Commander<br>
    Riker aboard...</p>
  <p> Pulaski gives it thought, shakes her head.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    No. I'd better go down and make<br>
    an evaluation there.</p>
  <p> Pulaski strides to the transporter pad, steps onto it,<br>
    looks around at the transporter with distaste. O'Brien<br>
    picks up on this, feigns uncertainty as he sets the<br>
    coordinates:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Hmm... I hope these are the right<br>
    coordinates...</p>
  <p> Pulaski gives him a sharp look. O'Brien grins.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN (cont'd)<br>
    Just kidding, Doctor. I know how<br>
    much you love the transporter...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    About as much as I love comical<br>
    transporter chiefs...</p>

  <p> Riker and Geordi as before. Pulaski MATERIALIZES,<br>
    takes a beat to check that she's still in one piece,<br>
    takes out her medical tricorder, and steps over to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Fill me in.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I was walking along, minding my<br>
    own business, making a simple<br>
    geological sweep... and something<br>
    stuck me in the leg.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Any pain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - 5/1/89 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No -- a little numb, that's all.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Do you know what it was that stuck<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> Riker shakes his head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've been looking for it, but<br>
    no luck.</p>
  <p> Pulaski continues her scan.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Well, whatever it was, it left<br>
    something behind... I'm going<br>
    to bring you up to Sickbay.</p>
  <p>11 OMITTED</p>
  <p>12 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Pulaski rises and touches her communicator.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    O'Brien, this is Doctor Pulaski.<br>
    Medical override is authorized.<br>
    Beam us directly to Sickbay.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>

  <p>15A INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two MEDICAL CREWMEN are standing by. Geordi, Riker,<br>
    and Pulaski MATERIALIZE. The medical crewmen cross<br>
    to Riker's side to help him over to a medical table.<br>
    Riker waves them away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I can walk to the table, thank<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/1/89 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>15A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Commander, don't start acting<br>
    heroic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor, for personal reasons, I'll<br>
    walk.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    May I ask why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've always had the notion that<br>
    if I was ever so injured that I<br>
    couldn't make it on my own two<br>
    feet... it would be over.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Medically speaking, that's<br>
    ridiculous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You'll get no argument from me,<br>
    but... that's how I feel.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a step toward the bed. His leg gives out<br>
    on him; he falls. Riker's more surprised than anything<br>
    else.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    Whoa --</p>
  <p> The medical crewmen pick Riker up and put him on the<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    This is the strangest feeling.<br>
    My whole leg just went -- dead.</p>
  <p> Off Pulaski's concerned reaction:</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is still in orbit.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 42976.1.<br>
    During a geological survey of<br>
    Surata Four, Commander Riker has<br>
    become infected by an unidentified<br>
    microbe.</p>

  <p>20 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker is on the center table. Pulaski is off to the<br>
    side studying her instruments. PICARD ENTERS.</p>
  <p> Through all of this there is a great deal of tension<br>
    even though those in the room maintain a detached,<br>
    scientific demeanor. Picard approaches the center<br>
    examining table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put your foot where it didn't<br>
    belong, did you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    The doctor's been getting bored<br>
    lately. I thought I'd find her<br>
    a challenge...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That you did.</p>
  <p>21 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Pulaski leaves a work station and steps over to the<br>
    wall panel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/1/89 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The commander's nervous system<br>
    has been invaded by an unknown<br>
    microorganism. Not a bacteria,<br>
    not a virus -- but with elements<br>
    of both.</p>
  <p> She activates the wall panel.</p>
  <p>22 PULASKI AND WALL PANEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Displayed on the wall panel is a rendering of Riker's<br>
    body. Pulaski touches the panel, and the injury to<br>
    Riker's leg becomes highlighted.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>

    There's the point of entry...</p>

  <p>25 SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Pulaski turns back to the examination table. She holds<br>
    a sophisticated scanner.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The microbes have infected the<br>
    great sciatic nerve... they're<br>
    multiplying at an incredible<br>
    rate.</p>
  <p> She moves the scanner near his leg.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (cont'd)<br>
    (indicating the screen)<br>
    There.</p>
  <p> The nerves in Riker's injured leg are now highlighted.<br>
    The highlighting extends up the major nerves into<br>
    Riker's thigh.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you remove it?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Not surgically. The organisms<br>
    fuse to the nerve, intertwining<br>
    at the molecular level.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/1/89 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's why the transporter's<br>
    biofilters couldn't extract them.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    There's no evidence of nerve<br>
    damage, but the organisms are<br>
    impeding nervous function.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    My leg's still asleep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Pulaski)<br>
    Your prognosis?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The infection is spreading. It<br>
    will eventually reach the brain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And if it interfered with neural<br>
    activity there...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Commander Riker could die.</p>
  <p> Riker takes it stoically.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How can I help?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I need to know more about its<br>
    composition.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And for that, you need a sample.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> Picard touches a com panel:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - 5/1/89 - ACT ONE 9.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, Mister La Forge -- prepare<br>
    to beam down to the planet.</p>
  <p>26 OMITTED</p>
  <p>27 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> DATA and Geordi are preparing to mount the platform.<br>
    Each carries a tricorder and a large phaser. O'Brien<br>
    is behind the console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I must reiterate that it would<br>
    be better if I went alone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't like my company?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your company is not at issue.<br>
    Your vulnerability to this<br>
    microorganism is.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll watch where I step. Besides,<br>
    how do we know that this bug<br>
    doesn't like androids even more<br>
    than it likes humans?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Possible, but highly unlikely.<br>
    In any event, why risk both of<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Because I know exactly where<br>
    Commander Riker was when it<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> Data accepts the logic, and they climb onto the<br>
    transporter pad.</p>

  <p>29 EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi MATERIALIZE. Because of what happened<br>
    to Riker this place is ominous.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He was right over here.</p>
  <p> Geordi is very careful where he steps as --</p>
  <p>30 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> -- he and Data move to the spot and hunker down.<br>
    Geordi examines the area with his VISOR while Data<br>
    begins a meticulous scan with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I detect no animal life within<br>
    fifty kilometers. Merely<br>
    vegetation.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    However, I am reading extensive<br>
    animal remains -- mostly<br>
    fossilized.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A graveyard?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know.</p>
  <p> They keep looking.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Look at this.</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates an unusual-looking vine. Data turns<br>
    his attention to the vine.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The structure is rhizomatous.</p>
  <p> Data reaches down to touch the vine.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Be careful.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am always careful.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/3/89 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>31 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Data lifts the vine up off the ground. The vine<br>
    looks dead -- harmless.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It appears to be dead.</p>
  <p> Geordi examines the vine with his VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not so sure. I can see<br>
    thermal variations...<br>
    (gets an idea)<br>
    Data, set it down. Let's try<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> Data does so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/3/89 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (cont'd)<br>
    Perhaps it likes humans more than<br>
    androids.</p>
  <p> Geordi slowly extends his hand to the vine, inviting it<br>
    to &quot;strike.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you are correct, you are<br>
    placing yourself in grave danger.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm counting on those great<br>
    android reflexes of yours...</p>
  <p>32 CLOSER ANGLE<br>
    as Geordi's hand nears the vine. All at once, the vine<br>
    moves -- springing toward Geordi's hand. But Data<br>
    moves faster, grabs the vine and holds it.</p>
  <p>33 THE VINE</p>
  <p> Data turns the vine over -- and we can now see a meanlooking<br>
    thorn protruding from the underside of the<br>
    vine.</p>
  <p>34 DATA AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> As they study it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd say that's what we're looking<br>
    for.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would tend to agree.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/4/89 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>36B WIDER</p>
  <p> The area around Geordi and Data begins to move. Large<br>
    clumps of vines vibrate. It is as if they are standing<br>
    on a great living thing, which has just awoken, and<br>
    is very angry.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (touches communicator)<br>
    O'Brien! Stand by!<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Hold it still.</p>
  <p> Data has to make an effort to keep the vine in his<br>
    hands from moving as the vines around them continue<br>
    their frantic oscillation. Geordi finishes his task,<br>
    slaps his communicator:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (cont'd)<br>
    Got it. Energize!</p>
  <p>36C INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien is behind the console. Picard ENTERS as<br>
    O'Brien hits the button. Geordi and Data MATERIALIZE<br>
    on the platform.</p>
  <p>36D NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Geordi looks himself over. No blood anywhere.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, O'Brien. Another minute,<br>
    and we'd've been fossils<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not precisely, Geordi. True<br>
    fossilization requires several<br>
    millennia.</p>
  <p> Geordi strides off the platform, shows Picard the thorn<br>
    he's carefully holding.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, here's your sample.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Get it to Sickbay right away.</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS with the thorn. Picard crosses to Data.</p>

  <p> PICARD (cont'd)<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, the commander's injury<br>
    was not accidental. Certain vines<br>
    on the planet evidently seek out<br>
    warm-blooded beings and<br>
    deliberately infect them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    To what end?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown. It is conceivable that<br>
    there is a symbiotic relationship<br>
    involved...</p>
  <p> Data hesitates. Picard prompts him:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go on.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There were numerous animal<br>

  <p>38A INT. PULASKI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Pulaski is at a library console, entering data. Picard<br>
    is looking over her shoulder. One of the medical<br>
    crewmen enters, hands Pulaski a chip which she inserts<br>
    into the console. She's not pleased with what is<br>
    displayed.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    All negative.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's nothing that will cure<br>
    this infection?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    This microorganism is very<br>
    mysterious. I can't even figure<br>
    out what's keeping it alive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Or how to kill it.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Oh, I can kill it... but not<br>
    without destroying the nerves it's<br>
    inhabiting.</p>
  <p> Pulaski takes a breath. Her frustration is evident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know you're doing your best...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    My best may not be good enough.</p>
  <p>39 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker, lying on the bed as before, flexes his right arm<br>
    by making a fist and then spreading his fingers wide.<br>
    His look of concern tells us the numbness is spreading.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from Pulaski's office. Riker relaxes his<br>
    hand and covers his anguish with a smile.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Comfortable?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How could I not be comfortable?<br>
    I'm being waited on hand and foot.</p>
  <p> Riker puts his left hand behind his head -- a &quot;kickback-and-relax&quot;<br>
    gesture.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    My only worry is that they'll find<br>
    out I'm faking it.</p>
  <p> But, of course, Picard knows this is no charade.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wish you were faking it. I've<br>
    seen the thorn, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The doctor showed it to me, too.<br>
    Harmless-looking thing, isn't<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> Picard can't help but feel pride at the stoic, almost<br>
    cheerful outlook of his subordinate.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But deadly.<br>

    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    These things happen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When you least expect them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm surprised they don't happen<br>
    more often. After all, we are<br>
    exploring the unknown.</p>
  <p> Picard's frustration begins to show:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And now and then we are humbled...<br>
    reminded that the universe<br>
    contains much that is beautiful...<br>
    and much that is malevolent.</p>

    malice.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    If I've learned anything aboard<br>
    this ship... from our voyages...<br>
    from you... it's that most life<br>
    forms act out of an instinct for<br>
    survival -- not out of evil.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at his protege.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A worthy lesson. I admire your<br>
    lack of rancor, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, if you drop a hammer on<br>
    your foot, it's rather useless<br>
    to get mad at the hammer.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at his friend with admiration, then EXITS<br>

  <p>42 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> One of the medical crewmen is running the scanner over<br>
    Riker's body. Riker's weak; his arms and legs are so<br>
    much dead weight, and it's a bit of an effort for him<br>
    to speak. Still, he's at his most charming:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This bug's persistent, I'll admit.<br>
    But I'm not worried. We Rikers<br>
    are ornery, too...</p>
  <p> The crewman can't help cracking a smile. In b.g., TROI<br>
    ENTERS. Riker doesn't see her.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    In fact, my great-grandfather was<br>
    once bitten by a rattlesnake.<br>
    After three days of intense pain<br>
    -- the snake died.</p>
  <p> The crewman's smile widens.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/1/89 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>43 ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Troi steps forward. Riker sees her, doesn't change<br>
    expression -- but falls silent. The crewman completes<br>
    the scan, puts away the scanner, EXITS... leaving Troi<br>
    and Riker alone in the room.</p>
  <p> A long beat. Troi crosses to Riker's side.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're a very entertaining<br>
    patient.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I try.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes. You're making quite an<br>
    effort to be cheerful.</p>
  <p> It's almost an accusation. Riker stares at her, drops<br>
    all pretense.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You of all people should know...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You feel what anyone in your place<br>
    would feel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    But I'm the first officer of this<br>
    ship. I have to set an example.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Even now?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now most of all. Deanna, facing<br>
    death is the ultimate test of<br>
    character. I don't want to die<br>
    -- but if I have to, I want to<br>
    do it with a little pride.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And a lot of impudence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You bet. Dying is bad enough --<br>
    but losing my sense of humor?<br>
    Forget it.</p>

  <p>43A NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> A shared moment. Then Riker's devil-may-care manner<br>
    returns:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I haven't given up yet. The best<br>
    medical team in Starfleet is on<br>
    the case... I'm sure they'll...</p>
  <p> And suddenly, Riker's voice trails off -- and he loses<br>
    consciousness. Alarmed, Troi looks at the diagnostic<br>
    readouts -- Riker's vital signs are falling fast.</p>
  <p>44 PULASKI</p>
  <p> ENTERS quickly and examines Riker.</p>
  <p>45 ANGLE ON THE WALL PANEL (OPTICAL)</p>

    It's weakening his autonomic<br>

  <p>58 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker is unconscious. At the head of Riker's bed is a<br>
    strange device -- a tunnel-shaped apparatus designed to<br>
    encircle the patient. On one side is a binocular<br>
    eyepiece somewhat like an electron microscope's. Troi<br>
    looks on as Pulaski and the two medical crewmen<br>
    position the device. Over this:</p>
  <p> PULASKI (V.O., cont'd)<br>
    Once there, it will kill him by<br>
    dampening neural impulses. The<br>
    only way I can keep him alive<br>

    off into... infinity, sir.<br>
    (turns to Picard)<br>
    Remember the course in ancient<br>
    history at Starfleet Academy?<br>
    Back to the time when men still<br>
    believed the Earth was flat?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    And that the sun revolved around<br>
    the Earth...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And if a ship sailed too far out<br>
    into the ocean it would fall off<br>
    the edge of the world...</p>
  <p> Riker turns back to look at the empty void on the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Beyond this place there be<br>
    dragons... &quot; It was even said that<br>
    crews would threaten to hang their<br>
    captain from the yardarm if they<br>
    refused to turn back.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure no one here has that in<br>
    mind, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How comforting, Number One.</p>

  <p>80A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    But what do I say? How should<br>
    I act? What do I do?</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Guinan and motions toward a nearby empty<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Guinan, I need your help. Could<br>
    you sit over there?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That seems simple enough.</p>
  <p> Guinan walks around the bar and heads for a table.<br>
    Riker and Wesley follow. Guinan sits. Riker sits<br>
    beside her. Wesley stands off to one side.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Wesley)<br>
    The first words out of your mouth<br>
    are the most important. You could<br>
    start by saying something like...<br>
    (turns to Guinan)<br>
    ... &quot;you're the most beautiful<br>
    woman in the galaxy.&quot;</p>
  <p> Riker holds the look for a moment, then turns back to<br>
    Wesley.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But that might not work.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes it would.</p>
  <p> Riker is relieved and amused. This is going to be fun.<br>
    He turns to Guinan.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you only knew how much I wanted<br>
    to tell you that.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But you were afraid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Of me?</p>

    Of us. Of what we could become...</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Commander Riker...</p>
  <p> They ignore him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... and that you might have<br>
    thought it was a line.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Maybe I do think it's a line.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you think I'm not sincere?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I didn't say that. There's<br>
    nothing wrong with a line. It's<br>
    like a knock on the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then you're inviting me in?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I'm not sending you away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's more than I expected.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But is it more than you hoped?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    To hope is to recognize the<br>
    possibility. I had only dreams.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Dreams can be dangerous.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not these dreams.</p>
  <p> He looks into her eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I dream of a galaxy where your<br>
    eyes are stars... And all the<br>
    universe worships night.</p>

    Careful, if you place me too high<br>
    on a pedestal, you won't be able<br>
    to reach me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I'll learn to fly. You are<br>
    the heart in my day and the soul<br>
    in my night.</p>
  <p> Wesley taps Guinan on the arm.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I don't think this is my style.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Shut up, kid.<br>

    Now, tell me more about my eyes.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    He's relaxed... experiencing<br>
    feelings of warmth. Friendship.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    He's reliving memories. That's<br>
    a natural side effect of the<br>
    neural stimulation.</p>
  <p> Pulaski punches up the diagram of Riker's body with<br>
    the organism highlighted. To her surprise:</p>
  <p> PULASKI (cont'd)<br>
    Look at this! The organisms'<br>
    metabolism has changed. I wonder<br>
    if the stimulation is affecting<br>
    them somehow...</p>
  <p> Pulaski again adjusts the device.</p>
  <p> PULASKI (cont'd)<br>
    I'm going to refocus the impulse<br>

  <p> The kind of place you'd like to visit. No particularly<br>
    formalized furnishing plan -- it includes just about<br>
    any way anyone would like to sit or loll. The same<br>
    sort of revealing but sensible garb here too -- along<br>
    with good humor. In fact, joy is what is mainly<br>
    present here. Lots of fruit, nuts, food and drink<br>
    selections. A MUSIC GROUP of harpists in sight --<br>
    admittedly strange looking harps on which they compose,<br>
    and now and then PLAY LILTING MUSIC which, like<br>
    everything else, is not taken too seriously here<br>
    either.</p>

  <p> TRUCKING WITH RIKER as he passes through the Council<br>
    Chamber bemused at the sight of the Edo of all ages and<br>
    both sexes enjoying music, food, and each other. He<br>
    comes to three who are playing a game with what appear<br>
    to be marbles, each holding one to five of them hidden<br>
    in the hand, then all of them simultaneously revealing<br>
    how many each of them holds. We don't have to know<br>
    the rules -- they know them and two of them will LAUGH<br>
    delightedly at the total of marbles exposed. One will<br>
    HANG HIS/HER HEAD in mock despair. Then when they look<br>
    up to find Riker watching, they extend marbles to him,<br>
    an offer to let him play too.</p>
  <p> EDO MARBLE PLAYER<br>
    This will please you. Join us!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (grins; shakes head)<br>
    Another time. Thanks.</p>
  <p> Riker moves on a couple of steps to where an Edo man<br>
    and woman, partially unclothed, are laying on a couch<br>
    locked in an embrace. If they're not actually making<br>
    love now, it is clear they will be doing it any moment<br>
    now. As Riker pauses a female EDO SPECTATOR passes<br>
    through, patting him on the backside.</p>
  <p> EDO SPECTATOR<br>
    Joy and happiness!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Certainly is.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles again, moving on through the room.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not concerned with pleasure,<br>
    Commander. I am a warrior.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Even Klingons must need love now<br>
    and then.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/3/89 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>81F CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For what we consider love, sir,<br>
    I would need a Klingon woman.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (eyes Worf curiously)<br>
    How about plain old basic sex?<br>
    You must have some need for that.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course. But with the females<br>
    who are available to me... Earth<br>
    females... I must restrain myself<br>
    too much. They are quite fragile,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (eyes him again)<br>
    Worf, if anyone else said that,<br>
    I'd suspect he was bragging.</p>

  <p>81H ANGLE ON WOMAN'S TABLE</p>
  <p> As Riker sits down, the IMAGES COME TO LIFE. The combo<br>
    BEGINS TO PLAY, the woman (Minuet) MOVES.</p>
  <p>81I RIKER AND WOMAN</p>
  <p> He looks at her with interest.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's your name, and tell me you<br>
    love jazz.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    My name is Minuet. I love all<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why not Dixieland?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Because you can't dance to it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My girl.</p>
  <p>81J ANGLE ON TABLE WITH RIKER AND MINUET (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A slight change occurs in Minuet. The way she looks<br>

    What's a knockout like you doing<br>
    in a computer-generated joint like<br>
    this?</p>

  <p> MINUET<br>
    Oh yes, Will -- I've never been<br>

  <p> Riker is knocked a little off balance by her look and<br>
    her directness.</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>

  <p> MINUET<br>
    Your work is very important to<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It is me -- it's what I am.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Can we dance once before you<br>
    leave?</p>
  <p> The invitation is so effortlessly offered -- and the<br>
    woman so appealing -- who could resist?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sure, why not.</p>
  <p> She rises. He leads her to the little dance floor.</p>
  <p>81L ON THE DANCE FLOOR</p>
  <p> As they STEP ONTO the dance floor, Minuet turns and<br>
    folds herself into his arms. They dance. It's slow<br>
    and sexy.</p>

    How did you learn to dance so<br>
    well?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    From following you.</p>
  <p> Riker is puzzled and amused at the same time.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    I can anticipate your lead. Tell<br>
    me more about your work -- what<br>
    is it about it that consumes and<br>
    enthralls you?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What an interesting choice of<br>
    words. That's exactly what it<br>
    does.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    You are very fortunate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know that.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    At this point in your life to be<br>
    exactly where you want to be...<br>
    And it's wonderful that you<br>
    realize it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'd be a fool not to know how<br>
    lucky I am to be on this ship<br>
    serving with this group of people.<br>
    It's a dream come true.</p>
  <p> She snuggles in a little closer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Just like this.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    A dream? Is that what this is?<br>
    Is that what I am?</p>
  <p> She fills up his senses. He holds her away, to look at<br>
    her. Her fragrance -- the lightness of her touch. Her<br>
    movement. Riker is becoming captivated by her.</p>

  <p>81L CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> As a woman can, she senses what he's feeling and leans<br>
    back to look in his eyes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know you are a computer-generated<br>
    image... but your smell,<br>
    the way you feel, your touch, even<br>
    the way you talk and think is so<br>
    real.</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How far can this relationship go?<br>
    I mean, how real are you?</p>
  <p> MINUET<br>
    As real as you need me to be.</p>

  <p>89C EXT. PLANET SURFACE (STOCK FROM #122 SCENE C21-22)</p>
  <p> Riker moves a STEP CLOSER to the slime creature.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander William Riker of<br>
    the USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I am ARMUS. You are in my space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We mean you no harm. We have an<br>
    injured crew in that shuttlecraft.<br>
    We need to get to them. May we<br>
    pass?</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    You haven't given me a good enough<br>
    reason yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Preserving life -- all life --<br>
    is very important to us.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We believe that everything in the<br>
    Universe has a right to exist.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    An interesting notion which I do<br>
    not share. You may now leave if<br>
    you wish.</p>
  <p> Riker and the crew are startled.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    We won't go without the shuttle<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> The Shroud REMAINS SILENT as Tasha makes a slight MOVE<br>
    TO GO AROUND IT.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I warn you. You will not like<br>
    it here.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    What are you saying -- that you<br>
    are going to deny us access to<br>
    our comrades?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>89C CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    I told you what you can do. You<br>
    can leave. I have no interest<br>
    in any further discussion or<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> Tasha has had enough of this and starts to move toward<br>
    the narrowest strip of slime.</p>
  <p> TASHA<br>
    Enough. We have people who need<br>
    attention. We will not harm you,<br>
    but we must help them.</p>
  <p> ARMUS FLICKS HIS FINGER, sending an ENERGY FORCE<br>
    towards Tasha, JERKING HER BACK and SLAMMING HER DOWN<br>
    to the ground.</p>
  <p> Everything from here on must happen in a blur of<br>
    action. Beverly jumps to Tasha's side. Riker and Data<br>
    MOVE BETWEEN the others and BLAST ARMUS with their<br>
    phasers.</p>
  <p>89D EXT. PLANET SURFACE (STOCK FROM #122 SCENE 24C)</p>
  <p> Angle on Tasha's body and the others around her.<br>
    Beverly quickly takes a reading. She can't believe<br>
    the instruments.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's dead.</p>
  <p>89E INT. SICKBAY (STOCK FROM #122 SCENES 30 THRU 34)</p>
  <p> The medical team is easing Tasha onto the operating<br>
    table as Picard ENTERS. Beverly barely glances up at<br>
    him. He MOVES OFF TO THE SIDE and watches silently,<br>
    with Data and Riker, as:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Status, Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Unchanged.</p>
  <p> The diagnostic screen shows her bodily readings to be<br>
    totally askew. Beverly and the nurse work together<br>
    as if they'd done this a hundred times before,<br>
    attaching the clamshell device onto the bed, over<br>
    Tasha's body.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>89E CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you bring her back?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm trying.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hopeful)<br>
    You've saved people before. You<br>
    can save her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Neural stimulator.</p>
  <p> The nurse immediately helps her attach the device,<br>
    which clips onto the bed and slips over Tasha's head<br>
    like a loose headband.</p>
  <p> As soon as both devices are activated, Beverly and the<br>
    Nurse anxiously watch the diagnostic screen. A FEW<br>
    KEY INDICATORS APPROACH NORMALITY. Picard is anxious<br>
    and impatient.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There. You did it.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No. I've got her on total<br>
    support. There's no independent<br>
    brain activity.</p>
  <p> Beverly grimly and quickly works the neural stimulator.<br>
    She pushes programming keys furiously, then hits the<br>
    start button. No reaction.</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    She's not responding, Doctor.<br>
    Her synaptic network is breaking<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No! Inject norep.</p>
  <p> The nurse complies as Beverly reprograms the<br>
    stimulator. Nothing happens.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We're going for direct reticular<br>
    stimulation.</p>
  <p> The nurse looks at her sharply. It's risky.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>89E CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Doesn't matter! Do it!</p>
  <p> The nurse punches it in, and Tasha's body TWITCHES<br>
    SLIGHTLY. Picard looks hopefully at Riker.</p>
  <p> NURSE<br>
    Neurons are beginning to<br>
    depolarize.</p>
  <p> Beverly is desperate, but calm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Increase to seventy microvolts.</p>
  <p> The nurse complies. Beverly pushes the button. Tasha<br>
    MOVES SLIGHTLY -- VERY SLIGHTLY. Beverly checks the<br>
    readout. Data and Riker look at each other -- it's not<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Doctor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Eighty-five microvolts.</p>
  <p> They quickly try again. And again. Finally, there is<br>
    NO MOVEMENT in Tasha at all. Beverly slowly turns to<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's gone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gone?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's too much synaptic damage.<br>
    That thing just sucked all the<br>
    life out of her. There's nothing<br>
    I can do...</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker and Data seem rooted to the spot.</p>
  <p> Beverly reluctantly pushes in a code on the overbed<br>
    life support clamshell. She and the others look up<br>
    at the big diagnostic wall screen and watch all the<br>
    LIFE FUNCTION INDICATORS FALL TO ZERO. They REACT to<br>
    the finality of this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>89F INT. PLANET DISASTER AREA (STOCK, #111 SC. 70 TO 84)</p>
  <p> The away reserve team MATERIALIZES. They are in a<br>
    passageway which has been severely damaged by<br>
    explosions. Water SPRAYS from the ceiling and is<br>
    already ankle deep on the floor. Data scans the area<br>
    with his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p> They push ahead.</p>
  <p>89G ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as they ARRIVE at a doorway. The door has been jammed<br>
    by the explosion. Data steps over and with his great<br>
    strength -- rips the door off its hinges and clears the<br>
    opening.</p>
  <p> The survivors are here. ABOUT A DOZEN of them, huddled<br>
    together on the far side. Beverly and her teams wade<br>
    through the water to them.</p>
  <p>89H ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND SURVIVORS</p>
  <p> As she kneels beside an injured WOMAN.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You are going to be all right,<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where are the others?</p>
  <p> The woman shakes her head.</p>
  <p> WOMAN<br>
    Gone. It's just us.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Commander!</p>
  <p> Riker turns.</p>
  <p>89I ANGLE ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> CAMERA MOVES IN TO E.C.U. Geordi is staring at a pile<br>
    of rubble.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There's someone there!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>89J ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> With great strength he moves huge rocks with remarkable<br>
    rapidity.</p>
  <p>89K ANGLE ON GEORDI AND RIKER</p>
  <p> They stand and look for a beat, then:</p>
  <p>89L ANGLE ON DATA</p>
  <p> as he lifts and carries the limp body of a child.</p>
  <p>89M ANOTHER ANGLE</p>
  <p> Beverly rushes over and while Data holds the child,<br>
    she quickly examines him.</p>
  <p>89N ANGLE ON BEVERLY AND CHILD</p>
  <p> From her expression it is clear the child is dead.<br>
    All of her skill will not help.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's dead. If we'd only gotten<br>
    here a little sooner... !</p>
  <p>89O ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He steps closer. A dead child. A moment of truth.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, if you indeed have &quot;Q&quot;'s<br>
    power...</p>
  <p>89P ANGLE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> He is fighting his emotions.</p>
  <p>89Q ANGLE INCLUDING BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Puzzled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I don't understand. Certainly<br>
    you can't bring her back to life?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>89Q CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    I'm prevented from that by a<br>
    promise.</p>
  <p> Beverly is surprised and puzzled; Riker is very<br>
    troubled.</p>
  <p>89R INT. TROI'S QUARTERS (STOCK, #127 SC. 81 THRU 84)</p>
  <p> as Pulaski leads the others to Troi's quarters.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's Ian. Please... please hurry.</p>
  <p> Pulaski moves quickly to the unconscious child, pulls<br>
    back the covers. She removes an instrument from her<br>
    smock and makes a scan of the child's body. In the<br>
    b.g., Picard enters with Riker and Data.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Save him, you must save him.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    What happened? Did he eat<br>
    anything? Did he fall?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Data, using his tricorder, confirms with a nod to<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The child is the source of the<br>
    unusual radiation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He said he's the reason the ship<br>
    is in danger.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That analysis is correct.</p>
  <p> Pulaski injects the child with hypospray.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm losing life signs.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>89R CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Troi stands by helplessly. Like any mother in this<br>
    situation, she is beyond grief. Tears streak her face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Oh, please. Please save him.</p>
  <p>89S PULASKI</p>
  <p> resets the injector and again she administers a dose<br>
    of hypospray. She waits for a reaction. There is<br>
    none.</p>
  <p>89T ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room is very quiet. Pulaski stands.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm sorry.</p>
  <p> Troi moves next to the cot on which the child is lying.<br>
    She is beyond despair. Her heart has completely<br>
    broken. The others allow her a moment alone, then as<br>
    Riker is about to move to Troi's side, a LIGHT -- the<br>
    glowing energy which we saw at the beginning -- gathers<br>
    from within the child and slowly rises. As it does,<br>
    the body that was Ian fades away until there is only<br>
    the LIGHT.</p>
  <p>89U INTERCUT REACTIONS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Troi reaches out and with cupped hands she collects<br>
    the LIGHT, cradles it gently and brings it to her.<br>
    As she holds it close, it makes her face all aglow.<br>
    Slowly the pain and despair drain away, and through<br>
    the tears she smiles. The joy she now feels shines<br>
    from her eyes. The Betazoid within her, embraces the<br>
    essence of the entity before her and she knows now why<br>
    he came and what he wanted. Then, in an act of pure<br>
    love, she releases the glowing energy as she would a<br>
    dove. For a beat the LIGHT seems reluctant to leave.<br>
    Then it does. It passes effortlessly through the wall<br>
    of the ship and away. Troi stares after it for a beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    (excited -- relieved)<br>
    Captain. The containment field<br>
    has stabilized.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>89U CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Troi turns and looks at her captain and shipmates.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then Ian was right. He was the<br>
    cause.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently so.</p>
  <p> Troi pauses, gathering her feelings and picking her<br>
    words carefully. She settles her emotions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He is a life-force entity... as<br>
    we passed each other in space he<br>
    was curious and wanted to know<br>
    about us, and he thought the best<br>
    way to learn was to go through<br>
    the process. To be born, to live<br>
    as one of us and in that way to<br>
    understand us.</p>
  <p> She pauses, then:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Captain, he never meant any harm.</p>
  <p> Picard nods -- he knows that is true.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There was a moment when you<br>
    smiled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (she smiles again)<br>
    He said thank you.<br>
    (she pauses)<br>
    I told him we will miss him -- and<br>
    I will.</p>
  <p> The others will also miss him.</p>

  <p>95 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Riker; WIDEN to include Troi and Pulaski, who<br>
    are encouraged as they observe the panel showing<br>
    Riker's nervous system. The highlighting has dimmed<br>
    just a bit.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    The growth rate has definitely<br>
    slowed. What is he feeling? Can<br>
    you tell?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sadness.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Just the opposite of before --<br>
    and it's having the opposite<br>
    effect on the infection.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then your theory is correct. The<br>
    organisms are sensitive to<br>
    different types of endorphins.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    And negative emotions...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Such as sadness...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    ... produce endorphins that inhibit<br>
    the organisms' growth.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then we've found a way to repel<br>
    the infection.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Assuming we're not already too<br>
    late.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How much time do we have?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    I'm not sure. His vital signs<br>
    are getting weaker. I don't want<br>
    to risk another dose of<br>
    tricordrazine unless I have to...</p>

  <p>95E INT. PAGH - MAIN BRIDGE (STOCK, #134 SC. 33-33E)</p>
  <p> Riker and his escort enter onto the bridge.</p>
  <p> The same sparse but functional look. The bridge is<br>
    manned by FIVE CREWMEMBERS at varying stations.<br>
    Captain Kargan is seated in the Command Chair. SECOND<br>
    OFFICER KLAG stands next to him. They are businesslike<br>
    in their appraisal of Riker. Firm but not harsh.<br>
    Riker steps forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander William Riker of<br>
    the Starship Enterprise.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    That is incorrect.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    You are Commander Riker, first<br>
    officer of the Klingon Cruiser<br>
    Pagh, or do you intend to<br>
    disobey Federation orders?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have no such intentions,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Exactly where are your loyalties,<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm afraid I still don't<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> Kargan explains carefully in a low, calm voice.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    This ship is equipped with our<br>
    best weapons and our finest<br>
    warriors. Although we are on a<br>
    peaceful mission we are prepared<br>
    to go into battle instantly.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 53.</p>
  <p>95E CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KARGAN (cont'd)<br>
    I know I can count on every<br>
    Klingon warrior in this crew to<br>
    serve and die in that battle.<br>
    So I ask again Commander Riker,<br>
    (beat)<br>
    where are your loyalties?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have been assigned here to serve<br>
    this ship and to obey your orders.<br>
    I will do exactly that.</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    Will you take an oath to that<br>
    effect?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (meets his gaze)<br>
    I just did.</p>
  <p> Klag interjects firmly to Captain Kargan.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    yI-Har-Qo! nep-we' ghaH! (Do<br>

    This is your second officer,<br>
    Lieutenant Klag.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Was there something you wanted<br>
    to say to me, Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Yes sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I don't believe you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I take it you challenge my<br>
    authority over you.</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    Correct.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 54.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Kargan)<br>
    And your position in this,<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    (with disdain)<br>
    I would call it your first command<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> Riker looks around the Main Bridge at the other<br>
    crewmembers.</p>
  <p>95F RIKER'S POV</p>
  <p> The Klingon crewmembers watch him, waiting to see his<br>
    reaction to this challenge.</p>
  <p>95G SCENE</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the arrogant stance and size of Klag who<br>
    gives him an insubordinate snort. Riker realizes he<br>
    has no choice. He deftly, with no advance warning or<br>
    aggressive motion, swings a two-handed blow with his<br>
    full strength and lands a monstrous blow across the<br>
    chest of Klag.</p>
  <p>95H SERIES OF CUTS</p>
  <p> The sound of the blow against Klag's chest armor echoes<br>
    through the bridge and is followed by the roar of his<br>
    breath leaving his body, and then his bulk smashing<br>
    against the bulkhead and slipping to the ground.</p>
  <p> Riker calmly steps around the still-seated captain and<br>
    steps in front of Klag who is struggling to his feet.</p>
  <p> Klag is almost to his feet when Riker swings again,<br>
    this time taking the legs out from under Klag who drops<br>
    to the ground again.</p>
  <p> The crewmembers are animated and watch the fight with<br>
    relish, not caring who wins or loses but that there is<br>
    combat.</p>
  <p> Riker looks over to the captain.</p>
  <p> Captain Kargan simply sits back and allows it to<br>
    continue.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 55.</p>
  <p>95H CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker turns back to the dazed but still active Klag who<br>
    is once more attempting to get to his feet.</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the combatant with a calculated but<br>
    astonished eye. Klag can barely stand but bravely<br>
    fights for balance. Riker shrugs, and rams his fist<br>
    into Klag's stomach, then drops him with another<br>
    double-handed blow over the head.</p>
  <p>95I SCENE</p>
  <p> Kargan applauds with a grunt and a motion of his head.</p>
  <p> Klag is awake but prone. He struggles to his feet,<br>
    manages to prop himself against the wall. Klag gives<br>
    Riker as much a look of respect as he is able...</p>
  <p>95J ON RIKER</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My oath is between Captain Kargan<br>
    and myself. Your only concern<br>
    is how to obey my orders.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Or do you prefer the rank of<br>
    prisoner over that of lieutenant?</p>
  <p> Klag calculates Riker carefully, then:</p>
  <p> KLAG<br>
    I will take your orders.</p>
  <p> Riker nods his acceptance. Klag returns it. Kargan<br>
    interjects:</p>
  <p> KARGAN<br>
    And you, Commander Riker, will<br>
    obey my orders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Agreed, Captain Kargan.</p>
  <p> Riker turns away from the captain, and when no one can<br>
    see him he lets his breath out.</p>
  <p>95K INT. QUINN'S GUEST QUARTERS (STOCK, #125 SC. 71)</p>
  <p> Quinn is sitting on the sofa, blankly staring into his<br>
    slightly opened briefcase. Riker ENTERS, catching him<br>
    off guard...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 56.</p>
  <p>95K CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ready for your tour, Admiral?</p>
  <p> Quinn quickly stands, but Riker has seen the<br>
    briefcase...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Quite ready, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's in the case?</p>
  <p> From where he stands, Riker can barely see a few<br>
    delicate-looking tendrils coming out of its opening...<br>
    He looks at the admiral somewhat suspiciously...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (thoughtful)<br>
    Actually... I brought this for<br>
    Doctor Crusher. But perhaps you'd<br>
    like you to see it first?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (slowly moving closer)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    A form of life. Discovered quite<br>
    accidentally by a survey team on<br>
    a distant uncharted planet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why haven't we heard anything<br>
    about that?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Oh, you'll be hearing more about<br>
    it shortly. But first there is<br>
    much scientific study to be done.<br>
    After all, this is a superior<br>
    life-form.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Superior?</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    Totally.<br>
    (voice grows hard)<br>
    Now come, Riker. Take a good<br>
    look.</p>
  <p> Riker stands where he is, uncertain of what to do.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FOUR 57.</p>
  <p>95K CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think I'll summon our science<br>
    officer --</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    It won't like your science<br>
    officer. It likes you.<br>
    (rises, grabs Riker's<br>
    arm)<br>
    Now look!</p>
  <p> Riker looks down at his arm and grimaces; Quinn is<br>
    squeezing it with tremendous force. Riker grasps the<br>
    old man's wrist and tries to pull it off him... he<br>
    can't.</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (dark smile)<br>
    Vitamins. They do wonders for<br>
    the body.</p>
  <p> RIKER CRIES OUT -- it feels like Quinn is crushing his<br>
    arm. Unable to break free, HE RAISES HIS OTHER ARM TO<br>
    STRIKE the admiral. Riker's BLOW IS BLOCKED and QUINN<br>
    responds by effortlessly THROWING HIM backwards toward<br>
    the wall. The FIRST OFFICER hits it at breakneck speed<br>
    and CRUMPLES TO THE FLOOR, severely dazed...</p>
  <p> QUINN<br>
    (dry -- evil smile)<br>
    Ahh, your life is so painful now.<br>
    But soon you'll be one of us.</p>
  <p> Before Riker can clear his head, QUINN ATTACKS again<br>
    -- rapping him across the chin WITH A KARATE KICK.<br>
    Riker staggers to his feet -- Quinn swings from the<br>
    heels with a sure knockout blow... RIKER DUCKS under<br>
    it and puts all his weight behind a powerful PUNCH to<br>
    THE ADMIRAL'S solar plexus.</p>
  <p> For a moment, Quinn seems effected, sucking in his<br>
    stomach and gasping for air... But it quickly passes<br>
    and he straightens and smiles at a disbelieving Riker,<br>
    before DEALING HIM A vicious double fisted BACKHAND.</p>
  <p> Riker hits his communicator.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (pained, weak)<br>
    Riker to security. Emergency --</p>
  <p> QUINN'S final blow KNOCKS RIKER OUT before he can say<br>
    another word...</p>

  <p>95L EXT. PLANET SURFACE (STOCK FROM #122 SCENE 51C)</p>
  <p> ARMUS HAS MOVED OFF THE SHUTTLE AND as it APPROACHES<br>
    THE GROUP, Riker suddenly feels a great force pull him.<br>
    He calls out. Data MOVES to help him.</p>
  <p> ARMUS<br>
    (as slime)<br>
    Touch him and he dies.</p>
  <p> As the away team watches, Riker -- fighting with all<br>
    his might -- is pulled inexorably toward the slime. From<br>
    the other direction, Armus also MOVES toward the hole.<br>
    As the creature's SHRIEK joins RIKER'S SCREAM, the two<br>
    SLIP INTO THE SLIME HOLE and DISAPPEAR.</p>
  <p> For a beat there is nothing. Then: WE CAN SEE only<br>

  <p> PULASKI<br>
    They must be producing a type of<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Can you intensify those emotions?</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>

    I can refocus the impulse pattern<br>

  <p> She glances again at the vital signs monitor.</p>

    But I don't know if he can<br>

    Do we have a choice?</p>
  <p> Pulaski moves to the device, prepares to activate it<br>

    No. If we don't neutralize the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I will not be coerced.</p>

  <p> No response. Rice looks confused.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    You don't, because you don't even<br>

    to fine-tune her equipment and tries again.</p>

  <p>117F CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> INT. BATRIS - CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> A CLOUD BOILS up at the end of the corridor. There<br>
    is a CRACKLING SOUND, followed by a RUMBLE.</p>
  <p> ANGLE ON THE AWAY TEAM</p>
  <p> They REACT.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - THE BATRIS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As it BLOWS UP.</p>
  <p> QUICK CUT TO:</p>
  <p>117G EXT. SPACE (STOCK, #103 SC. 108-130)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and the Tsiolkovsky are still tied by<br>
    the tractor beam, motionless. Riker's voice reveals<br>
    the strain he is under.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S VOICE<br>
    Ship's log, First Officer Riker.<br>
    The star has begun disintegrating.<br>
    Enterprise will be destroyed<br>
    unless it can be moved out of the<br>
    path of the star material<br>
    hurtling...</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - EXPLODED MASS OF MATERIAL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It is large, irregularly shaped, moving very fast as it<br>
    was hurled off the star's surface with more power than<br>
    a hydrogen bomb. To gain a sense of size, it should<br>
    BLOCK OUT A WHOLE SECTION OF THE STARFIELD as it PASSES<br>
    CAMERA.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... toward us. Our only hope is<br>
    for Lieutenant Commander Data in<br>
    the time we have left, to regain<br>
    his senses and reconnect engine<br>
    power to the bridge.</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ON MACDOUGAL</p>
  <p> She is on her knees on the floor, vainly trying to sort<br>
    out which optical chips belong where.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FIVE 70.</p>
  <p>117G CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ANGLE ON RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> as they ENTER FAST. MacDougal looks up at Riker,<br>
    helplessly indicates the chip chaos. Data smiles at<br>
    Wesley, who grins back cheerfully. Both are still<br>
    smashed.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Hi, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Nice to see you, Wesley. What... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (overlapping; urgently<br>
    indicating)<br>
    Data! We need the engines on-line<br>
    in a hurry, remember?</p>
  <p> Meanwhile, Riker is now beginning to perspire like<br>
    others who have been &quot;infected.&quot;</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Oh yes, I remember too.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    So, Data, if you don't mind...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (fast; to Wesley)<br>
    We've no time for courtesy!<br>
    (fast; to Data)<br>
    Get those damned control chips<br>
    back in place, Data! In the<br>
    correct order!</p>
  <p> Data hesitates, surprised at Riker shouting at him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    NOW!</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    It's like a game of &quot;how fast can<br>
    you do it?&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ah, a game!</p>
  <p> Data begins selecting chips, beginning to move more<br>
    and more rapidly. Wesley moves to the Engineering Room<br>
    viewer, adjusts the controls there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FIVE 71.</p>
  <p>117G CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    I think I can switch this to the<br>
    Main Viewer, sir...</p>
  <p> ANOTHER ANGLE - VIEWER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it switches to a SHOT OF THE STAR MATERIAL IN<br>
    DISTANCE BUT RACING TOWARD THEM.</p>
  <p> ANGLE EMPHASIZING RIKER</p>
  <p> turning from viewer to Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've got eight or nine minutes,<br>
    at most, Data. Can you finish<br>
    by then?</p>
  <p> ANGLE EMPHASIZING DATA</p>
  <p> If necessary, UNDERCRANK CAMERA now to show Data's<br>
    hands are moving very fast. He seems to be calculating<br>
    Riker's questions, then shakes his head without looking<br>
    up:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. This will take slightly more<br>
    time than we have, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker becomes aware that his hand is wet, realizes he<br>
    is &quot;infected&quot; too.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dammit, NO! I can't afford to<br>
    get it!</p>
  <p> He stands, sways, grabs for support.</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - MASS OF MATERIAL FROM STAR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> hurtling through space -- too fast.</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON DATA AND HIS HANDS</p>
  <p> UNDERCRANK CAMERA. His hands are flying -- almost a<br>
    blur. More and and more of the isolinear optical chips<br>
    are set in the command computer board.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If we had just a minute more,<br>
    sir...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/2/89 - ACT FIVE 72.</p>
  <p>117G CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> ANGLE ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> He looks up toward Engineering Room viewer.</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The mass of star material closer, hurtling toward them.</p>
  <p> WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard bursts in, presses his hypo against<br>
    MacDougal, then Riker, then another person, etc.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We didn't make it, Captain. If<br>
    we had just a minute or so more...</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> with the star material looming large as it rushes down<br>
    upon them.</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - ON WESLEY</p>
  <p> His fingers begin to dance on the panel.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Yes, then reversing power leads,<br>
    back through the force<br>
    activator... repulser beam hard<br>
    against the Tsiolkovsky...</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE, TSIOLKOVSKY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Tsiolkovsky now begins drifting to one side,<br>
    beginning to spin clear with the Enterprise moving away<br>
    from it.</p>
  <p> INT. ENGINEER'S OFFICE - WIDE ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the viewer in surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're pushing away!</p>
  <p> Data lifts his hands from the command computer board.<br>
    The isolinear optical chips GLOW on the board.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing; into<br>
    communicator)<br>
    Bridge, engage engines!</p>

  <p>117G CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> EXT. SPACE - TSIOLKOVSKY AND MASS OF MATERIAL</p>
  <p> The mass of material crashes into the Tsiolkovsky.<br>
    Her warp and impulse engines EXPLODE SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>
    on impact in a mighty BLAZE OF LIGHT. But Enterprise<br>
    is accelerating out of trouble.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>117H EXT. SPACE (STOCK OPTICAL FROM #137 SCENES 5 &amp; 6)</p>
  <p> as a galaxy class starship (USS Yamato) explodes in<br>
    a blinding flash. When the flash subsides, we have a<br>
    forward view of space and a barrage of fiery objects<br>
    hurtling toward us. Suddenly the saucer section,<br>
    engulfed in flames and explosions, sails past us...</p>

  <p>121 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE on Riker, pale and deathly. WIDEN to reveal<br>
    Troi and Pulaski. Troi looks at the wall panel:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (optimistic)<br>
    The growth rate's almost zero.</p>
  <p> Pulaski shakes her head with determination --</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    That's not good enough.</p>
  <p> -- and makes one more adjustment to the device.</p>
  <p>122 RIKER</p>
  <p> He looks like a fighter after a series of hard jabs,<br>
    and the memories now rush at him.</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/3/89 - ACT FIVE 73A.</p>
  <p>123 RIKER'S MENTAL POV</p>
  <p> A BLINDING CACOPHONY of juxtaposed IMAGES -- VOICES --<br>
    PIECES OF SCENES. The tempo quickens, builds to a<br>
    climax, and --</p>
  <p> SMASH CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/4/89 - ACT FIVE 74.</p>
  <p>124 INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> as his body jerks in a massive convulsion --</p>
  <p>125 WIDER ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Riker's vital signs jump -- then slowly begin<br>
    returning to normal levels. Pulaski, surprised, turns<br>
    to the wall panel --</p>
  <p>126 CLOSE ON THE WALL DISPLAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The highlighting is gone.</p>
  <p>127 ON PULASKI AND TROI</p>
  <p> astounded. Pulaski runs the scanner over Riker's body<br>
    to confirm. She taps a com panel:</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Sickbay to bridge.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Go ahead, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    We've eradicated the infection.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    I'm on my way.</p>
  <p>127A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (STOCK OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Yes, still in orbit.</p>
  <p>128 INT. SICKBAY - CLOSE ON RIKER</p>
  <p> as the device is rolled away. His eyes open. He's<br>
    exhausted, but aware.</p>
  <p>129 OMITTED</p>

  <p>130 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You still here?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (relieved)<br>
    I could ask you the same question.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/4/89 - ACT FIVE 75.</p>
  <p>130 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Pulaski steps up.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    How do you feel?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Beat. You wouldn't believe the<br>
    dreams I've been having...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, we would.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    You'll be pleased to know that<br>
    we've terminated the infection.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Great work, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Riker tries to move, realizes his head is nailed down.</p>
  <p> RIKER (cont'd)<br>
    Now, if you'll let me get out of<br>
    here and back to work...</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    Lie still. I have a few dozen<br>
    tests to run first.</p>
  <p> In b.g., Picard and Data ENTER.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why? I feel fine.</p>
  <p> PULASKI<br>
    There may be some residual memory<br>
    loss. I just want to make sure<br>
    you still know who you are.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Of course I know who I am. I'm<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the<br>
    USS Enterprise.</p>
  <p>131 ON PICARD AND DATA</p>
  <p> stepping up to Riker.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; - REV. 5/4/89 - ACT FIVE 76.</p>
  <p>131 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Delighted you're feeling better,<br>
    Captain.<br>
    (re: Data)<br>
    The admiral and I were worried<br>
    about you.</p>
  <p> Data gives Picard a confused look.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I do not believe you have<br>
    the authority to promote me to<br>
    the rank of admiral.</p>
  <p> As Picard and Riker exchange a smile, we --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
