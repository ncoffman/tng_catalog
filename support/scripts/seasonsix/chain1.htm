  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 46357.4<br>
    We have rendezvoused with the<br>
    starship Cairo near the Cardassian<br>
    border for an urgent meeting with<br>
    Vice-Admiral Nechayev.</p>
  <p>2 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD is just removing a cup of tea from the<br>
    replicator. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> RIKER and ADMIRAL NECHAYEV ENTER. Nechayev is a tall<br>
    graceful woman in her late fifties, with a dark<br>
    complexion. She charges into the room, her every<br>
    movement emphasizing urgency.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Nechayev)<br>
    Admiral, may I present Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard, Admiral.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (brusque, to Riker)<br>
    That will be all, Commander.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (warm, to Nechayev)<br>
    May I offer you some tea or --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Thank you no, Captain. I'm afraid<br>
    there's no time for the usual<br>
    pleasantries.<br>
    (quick beat)<br>
    I'm here to relieve you of command<br>
    of the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Off Picard's stunned expression...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE 2.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>3 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Riker, DATA, and TROI are seated around the table,<br>
    listening to Admiral Nechayev as she paces about the<br>
    room. Nechayev's attitude is clipped and to the<br>
    point... she has no time for niceties here. Riker and<br>
    the others are a little off-balance as they play catch-up<br>
    in this rapidly changing situation.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    The Cardassian forces which were<br>
    recently withdrawn from the<br>
    Bajoran sector, have been<br>
    redeployed along the Federation<br>
    border. They've mobilized three<br>
    divisions of ground troops... and<br>
    their subspace communications have<br>
    increased by fifty percent. We<br>
    believe they're preparing for an<br>
    incursion into Federation space.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are the Cardassians really ready<br>
    for war?</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    I didn't say war, Commander. I<br>
    said incursion. Our intelligence<br>
    reports suggest they'll try to<br>
    seize one of the disputed systems<br>
    along the border. We think<br>
    they're gambling that the<br>
    Federation won't actually go to<br>
    war over one system.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Will we?</p>
  <p> There's an ominous beat before Nechayev answers.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    I hope we won't need to make that<br>
    decision.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We've decided to send the<br>
    Enterprise to meet with a<br>
    Cardassian representative and open<br>
    talks. We're hoping that the<br>
    presence of the Federation<br>
    flagship on the border will send<br>
    a message to their leadership<br>
    about how seriously we view this<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where is Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> Nechayev gives him a very direct look. Clearly this is<br>
    not a subject she wishes to pursue.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    The Captain, your Chief Medical<br>
    Officer, and Security Chief have<br>
    been... reassigned.<br>
    (quickly shutting down<br>
    questions)<br>
    That's all I can tell you for now.</p>
  <p> All this is clearly unsettling to the Enterprise<br>
    officers, but Nechayev simply continues.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Do any of you know Edward Jellico?</p>
  <p> They glance at each other.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is the commanding officer of<br>
    the Cairo.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've heard of him. But I don't<br>
    think any of us have ever --</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    I'm giving him command of the<br>
    Enterprise this afternoon.</p>
  <p> There are startled reactions from around the table.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Captain Jellico helped to<br>
    negotiate the original armistice<br>
    two years ago and I believe he is<br>
    the most qualified person to lead<br>
    this mission.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Nechayev's look and tone of voice leave little room for<br>
    argument.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    The change of command will take<br>
    place at thirteen hundred hours.<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> There is a beat, then everyone begins to EXIT. Riker<br>
    stops Nechayev.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Admiral...</p>
  <p> Nechayev stops, but Riker waits until everyone else has<br>
    left the room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    With all due respect... it isn't<br>
    necessary to give Captain Jellico<br>
    command of the Enterprise in order<br>
    to conduct a negotiation.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    (flatly)<br>
    I disagree. The Enterprise will<br>
    be in a dangerous situation and I<br>
    want someone on the Bridge who has<br>
    a great deal of experience with<br>
    the Cardassians. No offense<br>
    Commander, but that's not you.</p>
  <p> Nechayev EXITS, leaving a very disturbed Riker alone in<br>
    the room.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. CAVES/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY and WORF are running down a dark tunnel. They<br>
    are each wearing black jumpsuits, with backpacks and<br>
    they're both smudged and dirty. They round a corner<br>
    and stop. Worf looks back down the tunnel while<br>
    Beverly quickly pulls a DEVICE out of her pack and sets<br>
    it on the ground. Worf FIRES a blast down the tunnel<br>
    into the darkness as Beverly activates the unit and a<br>
    FORCEFIELD FLASHES into effect, covering the width of<br>
    the tunnel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>5 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They both glance down the tunnel and then turn to go...<br>
    but they quickly stop as they run into CARDASSIAN #1,<br>
    who is pointing a weapon at them both.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Worf react... they've been caught.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> The Cardassian FREEZES. Worf and Beverly relax, but<br>
    they're clearly frustrated.</p>
  <p>6 INCLUDE PICARD</p>
  <p> who is standing off to one side, observing them. As<br>
    Beverly and Worf catch their breath, Picard moves over<br>
    to the tunnel where they just emerged. (The frozen<br>
    Cardassian is now o.c.)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were at least five seconds<br>
    slower this time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You increased the difficulty<br>
    level, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It'll be a lot more difficult<br>
    where we're going.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Which is where, exactly?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry, but I can't tell you<br>
    that yet.</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down on a rock. She's extremely fatigued<br>
    and frustrated.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain... it would be helpful to<br>
    know something about our mission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... I have my orders.<br>
    I'm sure you understand.</p>
  <p> Worf nods. Picard moves to the device Beverly attached<br>
    to the rock face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/13/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (re: device)<br>
    Now... this deflector isn't set<br>
    properly. You have to position<br>
    the emitter array so that it<br>
    blocks the entire passageway or<br>
    it's useless.</p>
  <p> Beverly's irritation is starting to show.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sorry. I guess I was paying too<br>
    much attention to getting away<br>
    from that last Cardassian. Or<br>
    maybe it was the phaser blasts...<br>
    or the falling rocks...</p>
  <p> Picard realizes he's pushing them pretty hard and he<br>
    backs off for the moment. He moves in closer to<br>
    them... trying to rally his tired troops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know this is difficult. But for<br>
    now, all I can do is ask you to<br>
    trust me.</p>
  <p> Beverly wearily looks into Picard's eyes... and finds<br>
    that she has no choice but to trust him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right. Let's do it again.</p>
  <p> She gets to her feet as Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, time Doctor Crusher<br>
    and me through the first tunnel.<br>
    (with a smile)<br>
    We'll pick up those five seconds<br>
    this time.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Picard start to run back down the tunnel.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; CAIRO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships side by side. (STOCK)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/13/92 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker is waiting near the platform. After a beat,<br>
    CAPTAIN EDWARD JELLICO MATERIALIZES. He is a lean,<br>
    trim man with rugged features and flashing eyes. He<br>
    bounds off the platform and moves quickly to Riker, his<br>
    every move suggesting a boundless supply of energy and<br>
    enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise,<br>
    sir. I'm Commander --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He shakes Riker's hand with genuine warmth.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    William T. Riker. Class of 'fifty-seven,<br>
    graduated eighth in the<br>
    class. I'm looking forward to<br>
    serving with you, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (a little taken aback)<br>
    Thank you, sir. So am I.</p>
  <p> Jellico moves toward the doors and Riker follows.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'm sure this change in command<br>
    has taken everyone a little by<br>
    surprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well... yes, sir.</p>
  <p> They EXIT to the Corridor.</p>
  <p>9 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Jellico and Riker ENTER from the Transporter Room.<br>
    Jellico sets a brisk pace.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    It caught me by surprise too. I<br>
    must admit, I miss the Cairo<br>
    already. But a Galaxy-class<br>
    ship... that's something special.<br>
    I can understand why you've turned<br>
    down a ship of your own to remain<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> The issue is more complex than that, but Jellico<br>
    doesn't seem to be interested in lengthy conversation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    How many duty watches does the<br>
    crew stand?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're on a standard three shift<br>
    rotation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Jellico doesn't hesitate to take charge here and to<br>
    make changes. He's a man who's used to making instant<br>
    decisions.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'd like to change that to four<br>
    starting tonight. I'd also like<br>
    to examine your duty roster and<br>
    crew evaluations as soon as<br>
    possible. I want readiness<br>
    reports from each department head<br>
    by fourteen hundred hours and a<br>
    meeting of the senior staff at<br>
    fifteen hundred. Do you prefer<br>
    Wil or William?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uh... Wil, sir.</p>
  <p> Jellico ENTERS a Turbolift and turns around, clearly<br>
    not inviting Riker to join him.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Where are my quarters, Wil?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've assigned you to cabin seven<br>
    three five. That's up on deck --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Deck seven.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I'll see you at thirteen hundred<br>
    hours.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift doors CLOSE, leaving Riker in the<br>
    Corridor. Riker takes a moment to react to the fast<br>
    pace of his new Captain, then he heads off down the<br>
    Corridor.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; CAIRO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Cairo peels off from the Enterprise and heads away.<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> A large number of N.D. CREWMEMBERS are gathered here<br>
    along with Data, Riker, GEORDI, Troi, Worf, and Beverly<br>
    (now back in normal uniform).</p>
  <p> Everyone is standing together facing the windows where<br>
    a small podium has been erected. Picard is standing at<br>
    the podium, with Jellico at his side. They are both<br>
    wearing dress uniforms.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to group)<br>
    Attention to orders.</p>
  <p> Everyone snaps to attention. Picard reads from a PADD<br>
    on the podium.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to group)<br>
    To Captain Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    Commanding Officer, USS<br>

    are hereby requested and required<br>

    of this date. Signed, Vice-Admiral<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I stand relieved.</p>
  <p> Picard shakes Jellico's hand and the ceremony is over.</p>

  <p> JELLICO<br>

    Dismissed.</p>
  <p> People applaud and then begin mixing, talking and<br>
    helping themselves to food and drink.</p>

    going to be.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know... but they don't<br>
    usually go through the ceremony if<br>
    it's just a temporary assignment.</p>
  <p>13 TROI AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Beverly sits down on one of the benches against the<br>
    wall. She stretches a couple of sore muscles. Troi<br>
    joins her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Sore?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sore doesn't begin to describe it.</p>
  <p> Troi wants to ask what she's been doing, but knows that<br>
    she can't. Beverly sees the curiosity in Troi's face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know. I wish I could talk about<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Troi nods and they sit awkwardly together in silence.</p>
  <p>14 PICARD AND JELLICO</p>

  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    I don't think they'll give you any<br>
    problems. But you might want to<br>
    check on the port lateral --</p>
  <p> Jellico smiles and claps Picard on the shoulder in a<br>
    jovial way.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'll take care of the Enterprise,<br>
    Jean-Luc. You don't have to<br>
    mother me.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles, a little embarrassed. Jellico glances<br>
    around to make sure that no one is listening.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    How's your team shaping up?</p>
  <p> Picard glances around also, and then steers them even<br>
    farther away from the others. Although we're not sure<br>
    what they're talking about yet, it's clearly something<br>
    important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    It's going well. But I would<br>
    prefer more current intelligence<br>
    on the exact lay-out of the<br>
    installation. The most recent<br>
    information is over two years old.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (quiet shock)<br>
    Two years... I don't know how<br>
    Nechayev ever talked you into<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (wry)<br>
    She didn't give me a choice.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (gets an idea)<br>
    Well, maybe there's something we<br>
    can do to help you. We'll launch<br>
    a class five probe just before we<br>
    reach the border. You could pick<br>
    up the telemetry aboard the<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That would be extremely helpful.</p>
  <p> Jellico smiles and then gestures for Riker to join<br>
    them.</p>

  <p> Riker moves to them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to each of them)<br>
    Captain... Captain...</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I believe we'll be arriving at the<br>
    Cardassian border during delta<br>
    shift. Please inform the delta<br>
    tactical officer that I want to<br>
    launch a class five probe just<br>
    before we drop out of warp.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I actually wanted to talk to you<br>
    about delta a little later, sir.<br>
    Right now, gamma shift is still<br>
    slated to be on duty when we<br>
    arrive and I'll be sure to tell<br>
    Lieutenant McDowell about the<br>
    probe.</p>
  <p> The merest hint of a frown creases Jellico's forehead.<br>
    His smile seems to fade a little and he fastens Riker<br>
    with a slightly colder eye.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Is there a problem with delta<br>
    shift, Wil?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, there is no delta shift yet,<br>
    sir. I spoke to the department<br>
    heads about changing from three to<br>
    four shifts, and it's going to<br>
    create some significant personnel<br>
    problems for us.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    So you have not changed the watch<br>
    rotation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir. I wanted to talk to you<br>
    about this when we had a chance so<br>
    that --</p>
  <p> Jellico never raises his voice, but his tone becomes<br>
    far colder and harder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (slow and firm)<br>
    You will tell the department heads<br>
    that as of now, the Enterprise is<br>
    on a four shift rotation. I don't<br>
    want to talk about it. Get it<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> Picard almost intercedes at this point, but restrains<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Now that means delta shift will be<br>
    due to come on duty in two hours.<br>
    I expect you to have it fully<br>
    manned and ready when it does. Is<br>
    that clear?</p>
  <p> There is a quiet beat as Riker notes the change in<br>
    attitude from his new captain. There is a great deal<br>
    of tension here, but there is only one answer Riker can<br>
    give.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you'll excuse me, sir.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Jellico watches him for a moment.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    He was your first officer for five<br>
    years...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And one of the finest officers<br>
    I've ever served with.</p>
  <p> Jellico turns to him and smiles.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Of course he is, Jean-Luc. I'm<br>
    sure he'll be fine.</p>
  <p> But Jellico's voice lacks conviction and Picard is<br>
    disturbed by this sign of tension so early. Off<br>
    Picard's reaction as Jellico moves away...</p>

  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p> JELLICO (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log: Stardate 46358.2<br>
    The Enterprise is on course for a<br>
    rendezvous with the Cardassian<br>
    ship Reklar. Fortunately, I still<br>
    have time to prepare the ship and<br>
    crew for the task ahead.</p>
  <p>16 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Jellico is standing at the Tactical station with Riker<br>
    and Data. There is one N.D. CREWMEMBER at an aft<br>
    station and another CREWMEMBER standing by to take over<br>
    Tactical.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I want you to install a bypass<br>
    between the main phaser array and<br>
    the secondary generators.<br>
    (taps something on<br>
    panel)<br>
    I also want to run the main<br>
    deflector pathway through the warp<br>
    power grid and the auxiliary<br>
    conduits through the lateral<br>
    relays. You may have to<br>
    reconfigure the transfer<br>
    interface.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The transfer interface is not<br>
    designed for that configuration.<br>
    It will take seven hours to make<br>
    the changes.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sir... you may not be aware that<br>
    our normal interface already<br>
    routes auxiliary power through<br>
    three separate relays.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT TWO 15.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (blunt)<br>
    I'm aware of your current systems<br>
    design. It's not good enough. If<br>
    these negotiations fail, we could<br>
    find ourselves in a war zone. If<br>
    that happens I want to be loaded<br>
    for bear.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll get right on it, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Jellico briskly moves to another science station with<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    These stations should be devoted<br>
    to damage-control and weapons<br>
    status from now on. See that<br>
    they're manned on every shift.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Mister Data, how long until we<br>
    reach the rendezvous point?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We will arrive in fifty-two hours,<br>
    thirty-one minutes, sir.</p>
  <p> Jellico starts heading for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/13/92 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Schedule four battle drills, one<br>
    for each shift. Run a series of<br>
    simulated attacks from a<br>
    Cardassian squadron. I want you<br>
    to conduct the exercises<br>
    personally, Wil. Get it done.</p>
  <p> Jellico suddenly stops before entering the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (remembering)<br>
    And... get that fish out of the<br>
    Ready Room.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Jellico and Data EXIT to the Turbolift, leaving a<br>
    frustrated Riker on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>16A INT. JEFFRIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Jellico and Geordi are in the tube. Jellico is opening<br>
    a Mees panel and looking inside.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I understand you served on the<br>
    Victory.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (off panel)<br>
    I want you to increase the flow to<br>
    the deuterium fuel loader by a<br>
    third... we may need the extra<br>
    capacity.</p>
  <p> Geordi notes Jellico's instruction on his PADD as<br>
    Jellico replaces the panel.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Captain Zimbata and I used to play<br>
    rugby together at the Academy.</p>

  <p>16A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Yeah. He was awful.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I was worse.</p>
  <p> Jellico cocks his head to the side, listening for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Check the EPS power distributor,<br>
    it sounds like you've got some<br>
    kind of fluctuation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (listens)<br>
    I don't hear anything.</p>
  <p> Jellico looks back at him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll check it, sir.</p>
  <p> They crawl out of the horizontal tube and then head up<br>
    the ladder.</p>
  <p>17 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Jellico ENTERS by climbing up through the Jeffries<br>
    Tube, with Geordi close behind. Jellico, as usual, is<br>
    moving quickly and efficiently while Geordi struggles<br>
    to make notes on his PADD and answer Jellico's<br>
    questions. Data is also here.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    The power transfer levels will<br>
    need to be upgraded by twenty<br>
    percent. The efficiency of your<br>
    warp coils is also unsatisfactory.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The coil efficiency is well within<br>
    specifications, Captain.</p>
  <p> Jellico moves to the pool table and begins looking at<br>
    the monitors.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'm not interested in the specs,<br>
    Geordi. The efficiency needs to<br>
    be at least fifteen percent<br>
    higher.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Fifteen percent?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is an attainable goal. But<br>
    it will require realigning the<br>
    warp coil and taking the secondary<br>
    distribution grid off-line.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Very good, Data.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    That's exactly what I want you to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Taking that grid off-line will<br>
    shut down the astrophysics lab,<br>
    exobiology, geological research --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    We're not on a research mission.<br>
    Get it done in two days.</p>
  <p> Geordi is too shocked to say anything at the moment.<br>
    Data offers what he thinks is helpful advice.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe that is also an<br>
    attainable goal. If we utilize<br>
    the entire Engineering department,<br>
    there should be sufficient<br>
    manpower available to complete the<br>
    task.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure, if they work around the<br>
    clock for the next two days.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Then you better get to it, Geordi.<br>
    It looks like you have some work<br>
    ahead of you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (tight)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>

  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p>19 INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jellico is standing near the door, holding Picard's<br>
    book of Shakespeare and looking through the pages. An<br>
    intricate wood carving is sitting on the pedestal where<br>
    the book normally sits. In the b.g., the fish tank is<br>
    gone as well as the model of the Stargazer.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> The doors OPEN, revealing Troi.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    May I speak with you, Captain?</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Deanna... come in, come in.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS as Jellico sets the book down on the couch<br>
    and moves to the desk. Troi looks down at a stack of<br>
    crayon drawings sitting on the desk. Jellico notices<br>
    her gaze.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (re: drawings)<br>
    The latest masterpieces from my<br>
    son.<br>

    It's an elephant.<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I'd be happy to.<br>

    But first, I'd like to talk about<br>
    the way the change in command is<br>
    affecting the crew.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I've noticed some resistance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I wouldn't call it resistance.<br>
    More like... uncertainty. Most of<br>
    them have served under Captain<br>
    Picard for several years. They<br>
    knew him, knew what he expected.<br>
    Now they're being asked to adjust<br>
    to a new captain and a new way of<br>
    doing things. They're uncertain<br>
    how to react.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I see your point. This all could<br>
    be very unsettling to them...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And to you. Perhaps everyone just<br>
    needs some time... time for you to<br>
    get to know and trust the crew...<br>
    and time for them to understand<br>
    how you want things done.</p>
  <p> Jellico nods thoughtfully and thinks for a few seconds.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I'm glad you brought this to my<br>
    attention, Deanna.<br>

    Unfortunately, I don't have time<br>

    You've clearly given this a lot of<br>

    charge of the morale situation.<br>
    Please see to it that they make<br>
    the adjustment to the new routine<br>
    quickly and easily.</p>
  <p> That's not quite what Troi had in mind, but Jellico<br>
    doesn't give her much of a chance to disagree with him.<br>
    He glances at the computer terminal.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I have a meeting with the new<br>
    Security Chief in five minutes, so<br>
    the duty roster will have to wait.<br>
    Thank you, Counselor.</p>
  <p> Jellico turns to his computer, but it takes a moment<br>
    for Troi to realize that she's just been dismissed.<br>
    She stands and heads for the door.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Oh, by the way...<br>
    (she stops)<br>
    I prefer a certain... formality on<br>
    the Bridge.<br>
    (beat, then with a<br>
    smile)<br>
    I would appreciate it if you wore<br>
    a standard uniform when you're on<br>

  <p> Troi stiffens a little... but Jellico says it with only<br>
    a hint of reproach.</p>

    duty roster, realign the warp<br>
    coils in two days, and now he's<br>
    transferred a third of my<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    If it makes you feel any better,<br>
    you're not alone. Captain Jellico<br>
    is making major changes in every<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't mind making changes and I<br>
    don't mind hard work. But he's<br>
    not giving me the time to do the<br>
    work. Someone's got to make him<br>
    listen to reason.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's not going to listen to me.<br>
    I think he's made that abundantly<br>
    clear.</p>
  <p> Geordi stops him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then can I make a suggestion?<br>
    Talk to Captain Picard. Maybe he<br>
    can do something.</p>
  <p> Riker considers for a moment... he's not sure.</p>

  <p> Picard ENTERS. He is wearing the black jumpsuit and<br>
    backpack, but now he's splattered with mud, and he<br>
    looks totally exhausted. He wearily takes off the<br>
    backpack and collapses into a chair with an audible<br>
    sigh of relief. He closes his eyes for beat, and then<br>
    the door CHIMES. Picard manages to sit up.</p>

    Oh, yes.<br>

  <p> With effort, Picard stands -- not wanting to be seen as<br>
    weak or tired, but he's almost asleep on his feet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What can I do for you?</p>
  <p> Riker looks into the exhausted face of his former<br>

  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Well... the Enterprise will be<br>
    monitoring your channel just in<br>
    case you do need to transmit a<br>
    signal.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain Jellico. We've<br>
    arrived at the shuttle departure<br>
    coordinates.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Did you launch the probe I<br>
    requested?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir. I wasn't aware that you<br>
    wanted to be informed...</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Thank you. Jellico out.<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    I can see why he's still only a<br>
    first officer.</p>
  <p> Picard is clearly troubled by something. Jellico picks<br>
    up on it.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Something wrong?</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers how to phrase this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain... I just want you to know<br>
    that Commander Riker is--</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I've read your reports, Jean-Luc.<br>
    I know you think highly of him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not simply my opinion. He's<br>
    been decorated five times by<br>
    Starfleet Command and offered his<br>
    own ship on more than one<br>
    occasion. I think if you give him<br>
    a chance, you'll find he's an<br>
    outstanding officer.</p>
  <p> Jellico considers him for a beat, then leans forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Jean-Luc... let's be candid for a<br>
    moment. The Cardassians aren't<br>
    going to listen to reason, and the<br>
    Federation won't give in to their<br>
    demands. And the odds are, you<br>
    won't be coming back from this<br>
    mission of yours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I want this ship ready for action.<br>
    I don't have time to give Wil<br>
    Riker or anyone else a &quot;chance.&quot;<br>
    And... forgive me for being blunt,<br>
    but the Enterprise is mine now.</p>
  <p> There is a long, tense beat between the two men.<br>
    Jellico finally stands and tries to ease the tension<br>
    with a smile.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Well... here's hoping you beat the<br>
    odds.<br>
    (they shake hands)<br>
    Good hunting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the door, but Jellico stops him.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Jean-Luc...<br>
    (Picard turns)<br>
    I believe this is yours.</p>
  <p> Jellico hands him the book of Shakespeare. Picard<br>
    takes it... they exchange a final look... and then<br>
    Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> Jellico settles into the chair that is now his alone<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now that we're on our way... I can<br>
    finally tell you about our<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> Beverly and Worf exchange looks. They've been waiting<br>
    for this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet Intelligence believes<br>
    the Cardassians are developing...<br>
    metagenic weapons.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (quiet, grim)<br>
    Oh my God.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT THREE 26.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not familiar with...<br>
    metagenics.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They're genetically engineered<br>
    viruses which are designed to<br>
    destroy entire eco-systems. The<br>
    metagenic toxins are released into<br>
    the atmosphere of a planet and<br>
    immediately begin mutating. They<br>
    seek out and destroy every form of<br>
    DNA they encounter.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In a few days, everything is dead.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Within a month, the metagenic<br>
    agent itself breaks down and<br>
    dissipates completely... leaving<br>
    every city, road, and piece of<br>
    equipment perfectly intact.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Leaving the planet safe to be<br>
    conquered.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Wouldn't using such a weapon pose<br>
    as great a risk to the attacker as<br>
    it does to the target?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's why metagenics and other<br>
    biological weapons were outlawed<br>
    years ago. Even the Romulans<br>
    abide by those agreements.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Starfleet Intelligence believes<br>
    that the Cardassians are<br>
    developing a new delivery system --<br>
    one which would protect them from<br>
    any accidental exposure to the<br>
    toxin.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They believe the Cardassians are<br>
    testing a way of launching dormant<br>
    metagenic material on a subspace<br>
    carrier wave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT THREE 27.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So they could activate the toxin<br>
    after launch... that would protect<br>
    them from accidental exposure.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    And because the subspace wave<br>
    would appear to be simple<br>
    background radiation... no one<br>
    would realize what was happening<br>
    until it was too late.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up a PADD and hands it to Worf and<br>
    Beverly, who examine it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For several weeks, bursts of thetaband<br>
    subspace emissions have been<br>
    detected coming from Celtris<br>
    Three. Those emissions may<br>
    indicate a metagenic delivery<br>
    system in operation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What do we know about Celtris<br>
    Three?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very little. It was thought to be<br>
    uninhabited until these emissions<br>
    were detected. Starfleet believes<br>
    there is a secret research lab<br>
    located somewhere beneath the<br>
    surface.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our orders are to penetrate the<br>
    Celtris Three installation and<br>
    determine whether or not the<br>
    Cardassians are actually building<br>
    a metagenic weapon.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And if they are?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then we destroy it. At all costs.</p>
  <p> A long beat as he lets that sink in.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    When I was on the Stargazer, we<br>
    conducted extensive tests using<br>
    theta-band carrier waves. One of<br>
    the reasons I was selected for<br>
    this mission is my familiarity<br>
    with the methods used to generate<br>
    them. Mister Worf, you're along<br>
    for obvious reasons. Doctor, your<br>
    job will be to locate and destroy<br>
    any bio-toxins we find.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Celtris Three is in Cardassian<br>
    space. How will we get there<br>
    undetected?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know where we can arrange<br>

  <p>27A INT. TORMAN BAR (FORMERLY SCENE 32 &amp; 33)</p>
  <p> A small hole-in-the-wall bar (similar to the bar seen<br>
    in &quot;Unification II&quot;). There are a few N.D. ALIENS<br>
    hanging out doing deals or drinking themselves into<br>
    oblivion. Picard, Beverly, and Worf ENTER and look<br>
    around. They are all wearing civilian jackets over<br>
    their jumpsuits.</p>
  <p> A Ferengi Daimon -- SOLOK -- is in deep conversation<br>
    with a N.D. ALIEN at a table. Solok is very<br>
    disreputable looking -- even for a Ferengi. His<br>
    clothes are rumpled and dirty... not a very successful<br>
    Daimon in terms of money.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    (to Alien)<br>
    ... if he doesn't pay up, I know<br>
    three large Ferengi who will not<br>
    be so forgiving.</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, and Beverly move to the table. Solok's<br>
    eyes widen and the Alien makes a hasty EXIT. Solok<br>
    senses trouble here.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    I didn't do it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're not accusing you of<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    Then what do you want?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're looking for Daimon Solok.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    (suspicious)<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have a... business proposition<br>
    to discuss.</p>
  <p> Solok looks at them... he's getting more suspicious by<br>
    the moment.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    Solok is a very busy -- a very<br>
    important man. He isn't here.</p>
  <p> Solok stands to go, but Worf puts a firm hand on his<br>
    shoulder. Solok looks up at Worf's face and decides to<br>
    stay.</p>

  <p>27A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    But I could... relay a message.</p>
  <p> Solok sits down again.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Please tell... Daimon Solok<br>
    that we're interested in arranging<br>
    some transportation... to Celtris<br>
    Three.</p>
  <p> Solok reacts to the name.</p>

  <p>27A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    That's a Cardassian planet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I understand that Solok<br>
    runs... &quot;cargo&quot; there from time to<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    Solok is no smuggler.</p>
  <p> A nearby Bajoran snickers at that statement.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    What are you laughing at? Get out<br>
    of here.</p>
  <p> The Bajoran leaves.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, if Solok were going to<br>
    Celtris for what I'm sure are...<br>
    legitimate reasons... we would be<br>
    interested in quietly booking<br>
    passage for the journey.</p>
  <p> Solok considers them for a moment... finally decides<br>
    against it.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    I don't think he would be<br>
    interested in dealing with<br>
    Federation spies.</p>
  <p> Solok turns to go again, but now Beverly reaches out<br>
    and and stops him. She gives him a winning smile and<br>
    seductive look.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (seductive)<br>
    You know... I've heard that Solok<br>
    is... quite a man...</p>
  <p> Solok stops cold and looks her up and down. His<br>
    attitude starts to change.</p>
  <p> SOLOK<br>
    Why, yes... he is... an<br>
    extraordinary man.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's why we came here... because<br>
    only Solok could help us... but I<br>
    guess there are some things even<br>
    Solok can't do.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves a little closer to him... runs a hand<br>
    over his large ears.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Grateful.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves away and sighs. Solok's hormones nearly<br>
    explode through his ears. Solok never takes his eyes<br>

  <p> There is a quiet beat before Jellico decides to<br>
    explain.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Lemec is a Cardassian... and<br>
    Cardassians are like... timber<br>
    wolves -- predators... bold in<br>
    large numbers... cautious by<br>
    themselves... and with an<br>
    instinctive need to establish a<br>
    dominant position in any social<br>
    gathering.</p>

  <p> Picard, Beverly, and Worf ENTER from the exterior of<br>
    the cave. They are wearing the dark jumpsuits seen<br>
    earlier and carrying their backpacks. Beverly has a<br>
    tricorder out and Worf is holding a phaser.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Be certain your tricorder makes a<br>
    precise map of our route. It will<br>
    be easy to get lost in here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf holsters his phaser and makes an adjustment to his<br>
    tricorder.</p>

  <p> Picard moves to look at the tricorder and she hands it<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's characteristic of thetaband<br>

    ground. He touches a control and then there is a<br>
    WHOOSH SOUND.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard pulls experimentally on the piton... it's<br>
    definitely set into the rock.</p>
  <p>40 WORF AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> As they put on their harnesses, Beverly can't help<br>
    glancing nervously over the edge. Worf notices.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    You're not afraid of heights, are<br>
    you, Doctor?</p>
  <p> She throws him a look... and then can't help but smile.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (ironic)<br>
    Of course not.</p>
  <p> Picard now attaches a line to the piton, clips the line<br>
    into his harness and then tosses the coil of rope over<br>
    the edge. Worf and Beverly secure their own pitons and<br>
    attach their own ropes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (over above action)<br>
    Now, remember to control your<br>
    descent... and don't tangle the<br>
    lines.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Don't tangle the lines... I'll<br>
    remember.</p>
  <p> They all put their backpacks back on. Picard tests his<br>
    weight on the line... it's firm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready?</p>
  <p> They nod. Picard backs carefully to the edge... and<br>
    then eases himself backward and down the rock face.</p>

  <p> The two ships sitting in space. (STOCK)</p>
  <p>43 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> GUL LEMEC is sitting at the table, quietly furious.<br>
    After a few beats, Jellico, Riker, and Troi ENTER.<br>
    Lemec stands up in anger, but Jellico strides into the<br>
    room and begins to take charge of the situation.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (angry)<br>
    What is going on? I have been<br>
    waiting here for --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (brisk)<br>
    I'm Captain Jellico. I believe<br>
    you know Commander Riker, and this<br>
    is Lieutenant Commander Troi.<br>
    Let's get to it, shall we?</p>
  <p> Jellico, Riker, and Troi move toward the table, but<br>
    Lemec isn't willing to just let this go. He blocks<br>
    Jellico's path.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    This treatment is a deliberate<br>
    insult to the Cardassian Union.<br>
    I have been kept waiting here for<br>
    over an hour.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Then I'm sure you're ready to<br>
    talk.</p>
  <p> Jellico brushes past him and deliberately sits down in<br>
    the chair that Lemec just vacated. Riker and Troi move<br>
    to sit on either side of him. Lemec is forced to walk<br>
    around the table to the other side to find a chair, but<br>
    he doesn't sit down yet.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (to Jellico)<br>
    I did not agree to admitting<br>
    others to this meeting.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT FOUR 37.</p>
  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    If it alarms you, I can ask them<br>
    to leave.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    I am not alarmed. But we did not --</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    A great many people are depending<br>
    on our efforts here, Gul Lemec.<br>
    We don't need to quibble over<br>
    minutiae.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (hard)<br>
    I have come to negotiate terms for<br>
    a Federation withdrawal from the<br>
    border, not to be dictated to by<br>
    some mere captain.</p>
  <p> Jellico is on his feet instantly. His eyes flash and<br>
    his physical stance suggests imminent violence, but he<br>
    keeps his voice low as if through strenuous effort.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (hard)<br>
    I can see you're not serious about<br>
    these talks. If the Cardassian<br>
    Union truly wishes to discuss<br>
    peace they can send someone who<br>
    can negotiate in a civilized<br>
    manner.</p>
  <p> Jellico indicates that Riker and Troi should follow him<br>
    and then he storms out. This has all happened so<br>
    quickly, that Lemec's only reaction is shock.</p>
  <p>44 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Jellico, Riker and Troi emerge from the Observation<br>
    Lounge. Data is at Ops.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Jellico turns to Riker and Troi. He has now dropped<br>
    all pretense at anger.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    Let him stew for a few minutes.<br>
    Then go in and tell him you've<br>
    convinced me to meet with him one<br>
    more time. Tell him I'm a loose<br>
    cannon... that he needs to be more<br>
    reasonable because I'm such an<br>
    unreasonable man.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Lemec will want to bring his own<br>
    aides on board. Pretend to be<br>
    worried that I'll object, but then<br>
    give grudging permission for two<br>
    aides, no more.<br>
    (to both)<br>
    Understood?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Jellico EXITS to the Ready Room. Troi and Riker<br>
    exchange glances.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, I'll say this for him...<br>
    he's very sure of himself.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    No... he's not.</p>
  <p> Off her expression as she looks toward the Ready<br>
    Room...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>45 INT. CAVERNS - CAVE BOTTOM</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf are standing at the bottom of the<br>
    abyss. It's a flat area, branching out into more<br>
    tunnels. Beverly is still on the rope, taking the last<br>
    few steps down the rock face. She jumps to the bottom<br>
    and Worf helps her unhook the line from her harness.<br>
    Picard scans the area with a tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 39.</p>
  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The installation should be<br>
    about... three hundred meters...<br>
    (points down one of the<br>
    tunnels)<br>
    This way.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up his backpack. Beverly looks back up at<br>
    the towering rock face.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't suppose we're going to<br>
    find another way to get back up<br>
    there...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doubtful.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's what I thought.</p>
  <p> Worf hands Beverly her pack and they both follow Picard<br>
    down a tunnel.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>46 INT. CAVERNS - ANOTHER SECTION</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, and Beverly come around a corner into<br>
    another section of the caverns where there is a dead<br>
    end. There is a SMALL HOLE, about one foot in diameter<br>
    in the wall which is directly in front of them. Picard<br>
    tracks his tricorder readings to the hole.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We need to get through here. This<br>
    lava tube runs southwest for<br>
    seventy meters before running into<br>
    another chamber.<br>
    (looks inside)<br>
    The tube opens up a little more<br>
    beyond this entrance. If we can<br>
    widen the opening, we should be<br>
    able to crawl through.</p>
  <p> Worf moves to the entrance and examines it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A phaser set to level sixteen<br>
    should suffice.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Make it so.</p>
  <p>47 ON WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As he pulls out his phaser and adjusts the setting. He<br>
    points it at the entrance and then FIRES. The phaser<br>
    is set on a WIDE BEAM which envelops the entire<br>
    entrance. When Worf stops firing, it is revealed that<br>
    the phaser has WIDENED the entrance to the lava tube by<br>
    about two feet. We can now see more of the tube, which<br>
    is just large enough for a person to crawl along on<br>
    their hands and knees. The tube is smooth on the<br>
    inside.</p>
  <p> Picard moves to the entrance and peers inside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Picard removes his pack and puts it in the tube ahead<br>
    of him. He climbs in and then begins crawling through<br>
    the tube.</p>

  <p>49 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Gul Lemec is sitting in his chair, flanked by GLIN<br>
    CORAK and GLIN TAJOR, his aides. Jellico, Riker, and<br>
    Troi ENTER. The Cardassians stand. Jellico acts as<br>
    though the previous confrontation with Lemec never<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (shakes his hand)<br>
    Gul Lemec, a pleasure.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    May I present my aides, Glin Corak<br>
    and Glin Tajor.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> Everyone waits until Jellico sits down and then they<br>
    follow suit.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Lemec is much less confrontational than we saw<br>
    previously. Jellico's strategy is working.</p>
  <p> Jellico looks over a PADD for a moment and everyone<br>
    again waits for him to set the pace. He pauses for a<br>
    moment, then plunges ahead -- his attitude is extremely<br>
    belligerent.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (blunt)<br>
    For the past three weeks you've<br>
    been massing troops in staging<br>
    areas, assembling strike forces,<br>
    and pulling ships from their<br>
    normal patrols. We will not stand<br>
    for this clearly provocative<br>
    behavior.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (cool)<br>
    I see the Federation spy network<br>
    has again provided you with faulty<br>
    information. We are conducting<br>
    routine training operations...<br>
    nothing more.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (contemptuous)<br>
    Then I'm sure you won't mind if we<br>
    send a few starships into this<br>
    sector for our own... training<br>
    operations.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Your fleet deployments do not<br>
    concern us. However, we are very<br>
    concerned about your refusal to<br>
    vacate those territories along the<br>
    border, which are clearly<br>
    Cardassian.</p>
  <p> Jellico jumps to his feet and pounds the table.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (angry)<br>
    You gave up your claims on those<br>
    territories when you signed the<br>
    armistice. You couldn't take<br>
    those worlds by force, so now you<br>
    want us to give them to you at the<br>
    bargaining table.</p>
  <p> Troi reaches out and pretends to calm him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain, please... we should<br>
    listen to them.</p>
  <p> Jellico seems to swallow his anger for a moment.<br>
    Finally, with a great show of effort, he manages to sit<br>
    down again. Riker, playing the part of the<br>
    &quot;reasonable&quot; officer tries to sound conciliatory.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Gul Lemec, I'm sure you know that<br>
    those systems are still subject to<br>
    negotiation by the terms of the<br>
    treaty.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Negotiations which we have pursued<br>
    in good faith. Unfortunately, the<br>
    Federation has not been as<br>
    forthcoming.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    So to speed up the process, you're<br>
    preparing for war.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    We are preparing to defend<br>
    ourselves.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Federation won't start a war.</p>
  <p> Lemec pauses for a moment... then he gets up and moves<br>
    about the room. Clearly, he knows something.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    That has always been your<br>
    position. However... I have heard<br>
    reports that a small team from the<br>
    Federation has already been sent<br>
    into our territory...</p>
  <p> Jellico, Riker, and Troi keep their faces impassive...<br>
    trying not to give anything away. Lemec goes on after<br>
    a beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Of course, I don't believe this...<br>
    such an attempt would almost<br>
    certainly fail... and even if it<br>
    succeeded, it would trigger a...<br>
    very serious response on our part.</p>
  <p> Jellico takes a moment before responding. The tables<br>
    have just turned here... Jellico is now following<br>
    Lemec's lead.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Then there's no need for worry.</p>
  <p> A silent beat as the two men consider each other.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    A short recess would seem to be in<br>
    order.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> Jellico, Riker and Troi stand to go... but Lemec stops<br>
    them with a question.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    (quiet, casual)<br>
    Where is Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> Jellico turns and faces him with a neutral expression.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Reassigned.</p>
  <p> LEMEC<br>
    Ah.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Well, I hope his new assignment is<br>
    not too dangerous... it would be<br>
    a shame if something happened to<br>
    such a... noted officer.</p>
  <p> Jellico meets his eyes and there is a long moment<br>
    between the two of them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain of Command, Pt. I&quot; - 10/06/92 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Yes... it would.</p>
  <p> Jellico turns and EXITS with Troi and Riker. Off<br>
    Lemec's expression of satisfaction...</p>

  <p>50 EXT. SPACE - CELTRIS THREE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The planet as seen before.</p>
  <p>51 INT. CAVERNS - LAVA TUBE</p>
  <p> Picard is crawling though the dark tube. Worf and<br>
    Beverly are following him single file.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Just a few more meters...</p>
  <p> He keeps crawling... then comes to a narrow OPENING<br>
    which leads into another chamber. He has to push aside<br>
    some dirt and rocks, before he can scramble out of the<br>
    tube and into the chamber, which is large enough for<br>
    him to stand in.</p>
  <p>52 WORF</p>
  <p> is still moving though the tube. He gets to the end<br>
    and begins to crawl out.</p>
  <p>53 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> is struggling over some rocks and dirt behind Worf.<br>
    There is a sudden RUMBLING SOUND and she freezes.</p>
  <p>54 PICARD AND WORF</p>
  <p> They hear the sound.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Beverly, get out of there!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>55 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> She begins to hurry toward the entrance, but it's too<br>
    late. The tube CAVES IN on top of her.</p>
  <p>56 PICARD AND WORF</p>
  <p> The RUMBLING SOUND stops and dirt is blown out of the<br>
    tube.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Beverly!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor Crusher!</p>
  <p> Silence. Picard moves to go back in after Beverly, but<br>
    Worf stops him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf dives into the tube, leaving a worried Picard<br>
    behind.</p>
  <p>57 WORF</p>
  <p> inside the tube, reaches the point of the cave-in. He<br>
    begins to dig frantically.</p>
  <p>58 PICARD</p>
  <p> waits anxiously at the entrance to the tube. A few<br>
    beats pass.</p>
  <p> WORF'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    I have her.</p>
  <p> Picard leans inside the tube and then re-emerges with<br>
    Worf's legs. He struggles to pull the Klingon from the<br>
    tube, but finally Worf's torso emerges. They both then<br>
    manage to pull out Beverly, who is covered with dirt<br>
    and is scratched up. She coughs and chokes for a<br>
    moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you all right?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>

    (coughing)<br>
    I think so.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Next time, you bring up the rear.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at her, then picks up the tricorder.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're nearly there. Do you feel<br>
    like you can continue?</p>
  <p> Beverly nods. Picard leads them down another<br>
    passageway.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>59 INT. CAVERNS - INSTALLATION ENTRANCE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly and Worf come around a corner and see<br>
    a METAL HATCH set into the wall. There is no other<br>
    sign of an installation here except for the bare metal<br>
    door. They wait behind some rocks for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (off tricorder, sotto)<br>
    This looks like a maintenance<br>
    hatch to the installation.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm picking up three proximity<br>
    sensors around it.</p>
  <p> Picard looks to Worf, who pulls a DEVICE about the size<br>
    and shape of a flashlight out of his pack. Worf<br>
    adjusts one of the controls and then sets the handle<br>
    into the ground so that it is standing up. Once it is<br>
    in place, he touches another control and THREE BEAMS<br>
    come out of the device and head towards three different<br>
    points around the periphery of the door. As soon as<br>
    they touch the rock, the beams DISAPPEAR.</p>
  <p> Worf checks a reading on the side of the device.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The sensor echo has been<br>
    established. The false image will<br>
    only last a few minutes.</p>
  <p> They pull their phasers and quickly move to the door.<br>
    Worf examines the door.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The hatch is magnetically sealed.<br>
    But I believe I can bypass it.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Worf pulls another DEVICE from his<br>
    pack. He attaches it to the door and begins to operate<br>
    the controls.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    I can't scan the other side of the<br>
    hatch... it's been shielded.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have no choice.<br>
    (beat, then quiet, to<br>
    Beverly)<br>
    Remember: aim low and fire in<br>
    short, controlled bursts.</p>
  <p> She nods understanding and takes a firmer grip on her<br>
    phaser. Worf finally finishes working on the hatch.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ready.</p>
  <p> They all move to defensive positions just outside the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> Worf activates the device and the hatch OPENS. The<br>
    three of them rush inside with phasers drawn.</p>

  <p>61 INT. CAVERNS - LARGE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> They all rush inside and find... nothing. There is no<br>
    Cardassian installation... just a large empty chamber<br>
    in the caverns. The only thing in sight is a small<br>
    CONSOLE sitting in the middle of the chamber which is<br>
    quietly BEEPING.</p>
  <p> Picard, Worf, and Beverly all come to a sudden halt as<br>
    they see there is nothing here. Off their astonished<br>

    It's a trap. Come on.</p>
  <p> But as he turns to head back for the door, all hell<br>
    suddenly breaks loose in the chamber.</p>
  <p> The following happens very quickly:</p>
  <p>62A WORF AND BEVERLY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> react as TWO ARMED CARDASSIANS come at them from<br>
    behind. Worf throws himself at one and Beverly SHOOTS<br>
    the other.</p>
  <p>62AA THE HATCH</p>
  <p> begins to close behind them.</p>
  <p>62B PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Dives for cover as TWO MORE CARDASSIANS begin to FIRE<br>
    from hidden points in the shadows. Picard returns<br>
    FIRE, but then has to physically fight off a THIRD<br>
    CARDASSIAN who rushes him.</p>
  <p>62C WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> drops his phaser and dives into the closing hatch and<br>
    manages to force it open by wedging himself in it.<br>
    Beverly FIRES a couple of BLASTS which take out TWO<br>
    CARDASSIANS.</p>
  <p>62D PICARD</p>
  <p> is fighting off the Cardassian with a quick series of<br>
    karate moves.</p>
  <p>62E CARDASSIANS</p>
  <p> begin to pour out of yet another point in the chamber.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>62F WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> can barely hold open the hatch as Beverly scrambles<br>
    through it. Worf yells for Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain!</p>
  <p> But before Picard can do anything, Worf is wounded by<br>
    a DISRUPTOR BLAST and he is knocked out of the hatch<br>
    and into the outer chamber.</p>
  <p>63 OMITTED</p>
  <p>64 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Picard turns to make a dash for the door... but it's<br>
    too late. The hatch CLOSES shut, trapping him inside.<br>
    He turns around and drops his phaser as the Cardassians<br>
    close in on him.</p>
  <p>65 INT. CAVERNS - INSTALLATION ENTRANCE</p>
  <p> Worf and Beverly have just emerged from the Large<br>
    Chamber. The door is shut.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Captain...</p>
  <p> Beverly shakes her head no, then whips out her<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    There are five more heading this<br>
    way from another tunnel. Come on.</p>
  <p> She heads off back toward the way they came. Worf<br>
    glances once more at the closed hatch, then he follows<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>66<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    67</p>
  <p>68 INT. CAVERNS - LARGE CHAMBER</p>
  <p> Picard puts his hands on his head as an armed<br>
    Cardassian takes his pack and combadge from him as well<br>
    as his weapon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> One of the Cardassians goes over to the flashing<br>
    console and deactivates it. The flashing and beeping<br>
    STOP. The Cardassian smiles insidiously at Picard, and<br>
    then leads him away.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>69 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; CARDASSIAN SHIP<br>
    (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships in space.</p>
  <p>70 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is looking at a monitor at the aft science<br>
    station as Jellico ENTERS from the Ready Room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain on the Bridge.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    What do you have, Wil?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (indicates monitor)<br>
    I'm not sure. We're picking up a<br>
    lot of coded messages from a<br>
    Cardassian planet near the border.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>70 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Which planet?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Celtris Three.</p>
  <p> A beat as Jellico thinks.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Can you detect any theta-band<br>
    subspace emissions coming from<br>
    Celtris?</p>
  <p> Riker works for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There're some residual traces...<br>
    it looks like there were emissions<br>
    up until a few minutes ago.</p>
  <p> A long moment as Jellico looks at the monitors. He<br>
    doesn't want to give anything away.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Open a secure channel to Admiral<br>
    Nechayev. Priority two. Put it<br>
    through to my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Jellico EXITS to the Ready Room and Riker looks after<br>
    him with a puzzled expression.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>70A INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jellico moves to his desk and activates the terminal.<br>
    After a moment, the Starfleet logo is replaced by the<br>
    image of Admiral Nechayev.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 51A.</p>
  <p>70A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    Those emissions you were so<br>
    concerned about... have just<br>
    stopped.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd say that one way or the other,<br>
    our friends have finished their<br>
    task.</p>
  <p> There is a beat as Nechayev takes note of this.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Have you heard from our friends?</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> NECHAYEV<br>
    Let me know if you do. I'd very<br>
    much like to see them again.</p>
  <p> JELLICO<br>
    So would I, Admiral.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS. Off Jellico's face as he<br>
    contemplates the fate of Picard and the others.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>71 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM</p>
  <p> The room is very large with a huge entry door.<br>
    (Footsteps tend to echo in here.) There are few<br>
    furnishings except for the center of the room where<br>
    there is a large DESK. Although not immediately<br>
    apparent, the desk has many hidden panels and drawers.<br>
    Next to the desk is the INTERVIEW CHAIR, an ominous<br>
    looking piece of furniture with the ability to manacle<br>
    the subject's wrists and ankles.</p>
  <p> Picard is pushed into the room by a Cardassian. The<br>
    door SHUTS behind him. Picard looks around for a<br>
    moment... then a VOICE is heard coming out of the<br>
    darkness.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MADRED'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    A challenge.</p>
  <p> GUL MADRED steps out of the shadows and moves toward<br>
    the table.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    You should prove to be an<br>
    interesting challenge. Possibly<br>
    the most interesting to come<br>
    through that door in many years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Why... you, of course.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Picard. Jean-Luc. Serial number<br>
    SP dash nine three seven dash two<br>
    one five. Son of Maurice and<br>
    Yvette Picard, born in La Barre,<br>
    France. Former Captain of the<br>
    Stargazer... where you conducted<br>
    extensive studies on theta-band<br>
    subspace carrier waves.</p>
  <p> Picard is shocked at this level of knowledge and what<br>
    it implies.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    Don't look so surprised. How<br>
    could we have designed a lure for<br>
    the Captain of the Federation<br>
    flagship unless we knew something<br>
    about his background.</p>
  <p> Picard recovers quickly and his features harden.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right... so you concocted an<br>
    elaborate ruse to bring me here.<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> Madred's expression hardens.</p>
  <p> MADRED<br>
    In this room, you do not ask<br>
    questions. I ask them, and you<br>
    answer. And if I'm not satisfied<br>
    with those answers... you will<br>
    die.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Chain... , Pt. I&quot; - REV. 10/07/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>71 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Off Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> SUPER: &quot;TO BE CONTINUED&quot;</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
