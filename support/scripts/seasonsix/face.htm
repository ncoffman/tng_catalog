    &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 ECU - DEANNA TROI</p>
  <p> It's dark and we can see little of her face. Her eyes<br>
    are closed tightly and she twitches restlessly, as<br>
    though she's trying to pull away from something. It<br>
    looks like she's having a nightmare.</p>
  <p> With a sudden, terrified GASP, her eyes SNAP WIDE OPEN.</p>
  <p> REVEAL:</p>
  <p>2 INT. THE ROMULAN WARBIRD - TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Deanna sits up on a bed, breathing heavily (note: we<br>
    should see Deanna in dim silhouette only; the details<br>
    of the room should be vague and shadowed as well). Her<br>
    voice is cracked and dry.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Computer... lights.</p>
  <p> There is no response. The room stays dark.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (louder)<br>
    Computer, turn on the lights.</p>
  <p> Again, nothing happens.</p>
  <p> Deanna clutches her head and moans. She moves off the<br>
    bed... and almost immediately bumps into something.<br>
    She reacts, surprised; clearly, this is not the room<br>
    she's familiar with. She finds a wall and begins to<br>
    feel her way along it.</p>
  <p> Eventually, her hands find a control panel. She taps<br>
    several buttons before A LIGHT TURNS ON.</p>
  <p> REVEAL that Deanna is standing in a set of quart rs on<br>
    a Romulan Warbird. The room is spartan in nature, but<br>
    the Romulan Imperial Seal is clearly visible on a wall.<br>
    Troi is in front of a dresser, staring into a mirror.<br>
    She runs her hands over her face, her eyebrows, her<br>
    ears, as her reflection stares back in utter disbelief.<br>
    She looks like a Romulan.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ROMULAN WARBIRD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp.</p>
  <p>4 INT. WARBIRD - TROI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Deanna has not yet recovered from the shock of her<br>
    transformation. She is groggy and disoriented. She's<br>
    dressed in the uniform of a Romulan officer, but it's<br>
    somewhat different from the ones we've seen in the<br>
    past. The color is brighter and there is a distinctive<br>
    insignia on her right shoulder.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the DOOR OPENS and a Romulan officer, SUBCOMMANDER<br>
    N'VEK, ENTERS (he wears the standard Romulan<br>
    uniform). Deanna tenses, instantly on her guard as<br>
    N'Vek moves towards her.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Good, you're awake.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (woozy)<br>
    Who... are you?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Please, Counselor, there is little<br>
    time. The Commander will be<br>
    calling for you at any moment.</p>
  <p> N'Vek moves quickly and efficiently, and there is an<br>
    underlying urgency in his voice. He takes out a tech<br>
    device and adjusts it. He tries to bring it near<br>
    Deanna's face, but she pushes at his arm, keeping the<br>
    device away from her.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Where am I?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    You are aboard the Imperial<br>
    Romulan Warbird Khazara. I am Sub-Commander<br>
    N'Vek.</p>
  <p> Deanna is confused, uncertain what to do next.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Warbird?</p>
  <p> She tries to make sense of this. N'Vek begins scanning<br>
    her with the tech device. Troi is still disoriented as<br>
    she tries to make sense of her situation.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I was at the neuro-psychology<br>
    seminar on Bokara-Six. The last<br>
    thing I remember was returning to<br>
    my quarters. I was...<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    ...attacked. I felt a...<br>
    hypospray?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    It was necessary. I could not be<br>
    certain you would come<br>
    voluntarily.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    My head... is still spinning...</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    There are drugs in your system,<br>
    but they've nearly dissipated.<br>
    The disorientation will pass.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why have you brought me here?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Listen to me carefully.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You are no longer Deanna Troi.<br>
    You are Major Rakal of the Tal<br>
    Shiar, the Imperial Intelligence.<br>
    Commander Toreth will--</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Am I a prisoner?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/19/92 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    No. There is no time to explain<br>
    everything. You must listen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Commander Toreth will want to know<br>
    your mission. Tell her nothing.<br>
    Simply instruct her to proceed to<br>
    the Kaleb sector, course one-oh-two<br>
    mark four.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The Kaleb sector...</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Repeat it... heading one-oh-two<br>
    mark four.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Heading... one-oh-two mark four...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She'll... take orders... from me?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    You are an officer of the Tal<br>
    Shiar. She will obey you. But do<br>
    not push her too far.</p>
  <p> We hear a BEEP and N'Vek stiffens instantly.</p>
  <p> TORETH'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sub-Commander N'Vek. We are<br>
    approaching the loading point.<br>
    Bring our guest to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> N'Vek taps a com device.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Yes, Commander. Immediately.</p>
  <p> N'Vek begins hurriedly adjusting Troi's uniform, making<br>
    certain everything looks correct. He hands her a<br>
    disruptor.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Please, we must hurry.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not going anywhere... tell me<br>
    what this is about.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    You are a Starfleet officer<br>
    disguised as a Romulan. Unless<br>
    you trust me and do exactly as I<br>
    have said... Toreth will discover<br>
    you -- and you will be killed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/19/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How do I know I won't be killed<br>
    anyway?</p>
  <p> He regards her intently for a moment.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Your only chance to get off this<br>
    ship alive is to do as I say.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You are an empath. You would know<br>
    if I am lying. Am I?</p>
  <p> She studies him carefully for a beat, then<br>
    acknowledges.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Then let us go see the Commander.</p>
  <p> N'Vek moves to the door which OPENS. Troi stands still<br>
    for a beat... but there's only one possible decision.<br>
    She follows N'Vek out and they EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE WARBIRD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it enters orbit around a planet.</p>
  <p>6 INT. THE WARBIRD - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Several N.D. ROMULANS attend various stations around<br>
    the perimeter. A single PILOT sits at a console in<br>
    front of the main Viewscreen. The Commander's station<br>
    is against the back wall. It is not a chair, but a<br>
    raised platform upon which the Commander stands. It's<br>
    encircled by a railing to lean on and several command<br>
    consoles. The entire room is forward of the Commander.<br>
    Every inch of the Bridge is under her surveillance at<br>
    all times -- and nothing goes on behind her back.</p>
  <p> COMMANDER TORETH is a woman with a regal bearing and<br>
    the grim look of a soldier who has seen many battles.<br>
    She stands on her platform, watching the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> Troi and N'Vek ENTER and move toward Toreth's station<br>
    where they wait. Toreth pointedly ignores them both.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 5A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Orbit established, Commander.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    You may commence loading the<br>
    cargo. Notify me when the<br>
    transfer is complete.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> She silently surveys the Bridge for another moment<br>
    before she turns to notice them. The moment she does,<br>
    N'Vek speaks up.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Sir, may I present Major Rakal of<br>
    the Tal Shiar.</p>
  <p> Toreth fixes her gaze on Troi. It is a long,<br>
    scrutinizing moment. She neither salutes nor extends<br>
    her hand in greeting. After a moment --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    (to Troi)<br>
    This is Commander Toreth.</p>
  <p> Troi inclines her head slightly.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    (to N'Vek)<br>
    Attend to your station.</p>
  <p> It is an abrupt but absolute dismissal, issued without<br>
    ever looking at him. N'Vek withdraws to a nearby<br>
    station, trying to keep an eye on Troi, who is now<br>
    alone in the lion's den.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Why are you here without your<br>
    guards?</p>
  <p> Troi hesitates, not sure of the right answer.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    The mission is one of utmost<br>
    secrecy. I could not... risk...<br>
    bringing guards.</p>
  <p> Toreth eyes her... she senses uncertainty and weakness:<br>
    this Intelligence Officer can be pushed.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    And exactly what is the nature of<br>
    this clandestine assignment?</p>
  <p> Again, Troi hesitates. She's had no briefing on any of<br>
    this; she's flying blind.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I... cannot reveal that.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Oh? Why not?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/23/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I am under orders.</p>
  <p> Toreth moves toward her, circling, appraising -- a move<br>
    intended to intimidate.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    You don't act like a member of the<br>
    Tal Shiar. How long have you been<br>
    with Intelligence?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Several months.</p>
  <p> A smile curls on Toreth's lips... she is feeling less<br>
    threatened by this unintimidating officer.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Ah.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Commander, the cargo is on board<br>
    and secured.</p>
  <p> Toreth notes the information but her attention remains<br>
    fixed on Troi.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Tell me... is there a reason why<br>
    the Commander of the ship is being<br>
    kept ignorant of its cargo?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know what you mean...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/23/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I've been ordered to take on<br>
    cargo... but its contents are<br>
    unknown to me. Does that seem<br>
    wise?</p>
  <p> Troi does not respond.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I am responsible for the safety of<br>
    this ship and its crew. How do I<br>
    know this cargo is safe to<br>
    transport?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure it is safe. Otherwise it<br>
    would not have been loaded.</p>
  <p> Toreth's eyes sparkle with dark amusement. She begins<br>
    to circle the Bridge, including every member of the<br>
    crew in her indictment of the Tal Shiar.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Ah. Because the Tal Shiar is so<br>
    deeply concerned with the safety<br>
    and well-being of the military...</p>
  <p> There are a few grim smiles at this from the others.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I'm sure every person on this<br>
    Bridge could offer testimony about<br>
    personal experiences with the Tal<br>
    Shiar... and I doubt that many<br>
    would recall those encounters as<br>
    tender and caring...</p>
  <p> Toreth is gaining strength and confidence. She clearly<br>
    feels that this Intelligence officer is an insect to be<br>
    brushed away.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    So you will forgive me, Major, if<br>
    I am hesitant to accept your<br>
    assurances that the cargo is no<br>
    danger to my crew.</p>
  <p> She walks right up to Troi and stares at her, issuing<br>
    a challenge.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I intend to open those containers --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> Troi takes a beat to look around the Bridge... heads<br>
    have turned to see how this Major will react to this<br>
    confrontation. Her glance brushes over N'Vek, who is<br>
    struggling not to give anything away. Troi realizes<br>
    she is dangerously close to losing control of the<br>
    situation, and must quickly re-establish her authority.<br>
    She's still weak and groggy, she has no idea what she's<br>
    doing here, and she knows she's in immense danger. But<br>
    she'd better find an inner strength. She turns to<br>
    Toreth, her eyes dark and her tone hard.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That cargo is the property of the<br>
    Tal Shiar. You will not touch it.</p>
  <p> But Toreth hasn't given up yet.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    By whose authority?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mine. And if you do not wish to<br>
    undergo another &quot;personal<br>
    experience&quot; with the Tal Shiar, I<br>
    suggest you not question me again.</p>
  <p> Toreth stiffens slightly. The insect is stinging back.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander Toreth... you will now<br>
    proceed on course bearing one-oh-two<br>
    mark four to the Kaleb sector.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    The Kaleb sector is virtually<br>
    deserted. Why would we go there?</p>
  <p> Troi looks Toreth directly in the eye.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Because those are your orders.</p>
  <p> Toreth meets Troi's gaze impassively for a long beat.<br>
    Finally, she turns to the pilot.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Pilot, set course. Bearing one-oh-two<br>
    mark four. Warp six.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT ONE 8B.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> In the b.g., N'Vek relaxes visibly. Off Troi's<br>
    reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around a small outpost.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46519.1.<br>
    We have arrived at Research<br>
    Station seventy-five to take on a<br>
    rather unique passenger... one<br>
    whose homecoming will undoubtedly<br>
    be difficult.</p>
  <p>8 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> RIKER, BEVERLY, and WORF on the move. Beverly carries<br>
    a medical tricorder; Riker and Worf do not look pleased<br>
    at all.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The man acted dishonorably. He is<br>
    a traitor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He risked his life to get here.<br>
    It took him two weeks alone in a<br>
    scout ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That does not excuse his original<br>
    actions.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, maybe he finally realized he<br>
    made a mistake.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It took him twenty years too long.</p>
  <p> They EXIT the corridor into the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>9 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous action as Riker, Beverly, nd Worf ENTER. An<br>
    N.D. CREWMAN is at the console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Crewman)<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The Crewman works the console and the figure of STEFAN<br>
    DESEVE MATERIALIZES on the platform. He is in his late<br>
    forties, but his face is lined and worn beyond his<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> He wears the unadorned uniform of an enlisted Romulan<br>
    soldier. The moment he sees Riker, he comes stiffly to<br>
    attention.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to the sight of the uniform; he doesn't<br>
    like seeing DeSeve in it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (hard, formal)<br>
    Ensign DeSeve. By order of<br>
    Starfleet Command, you are hereby<br>
    placed under arrest for treason.</p>
  <p> DeSeve steps off the platform.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    I... understand.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves to him and begins scanning him with her<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    After Doctor Crusher certifies you<br>
    medically fit, you will be<br>
    confined to quarters until a<br>
    formal courts martial can be<br>
    convened.</p>
  <p> DeSeve had been prepared for this and he takes it<br>
    stoically.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And get some civilian clothes. I<br>
    don't want to see you in that<br>
    uniform.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Yes, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Commander -- I must speak with<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Captain is a busy man.</p>
  <p> DeSeve moves toward him.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    Please... it's important. Urgent.</p>
  <p> Worf takes a step forward and DeSeve falls back,<br>
    clearly intimidated. Riker waits a beat before<br>
    answering.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll tell him.</p>
  <p> Worf indicates the door and DeSeve reluctantly follows<br>
    Beverly out.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 INT. DESEVE'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> DeSeve is looking around his quarters with<br>
    uncertainty... he feels disoriented and alone here. He<br>
    moves to the replicator.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    (to replicator)<br>
    Vorcha'ak.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    There is no listing for Vorcha'ak.</p>
  <p> DeSeve thinks for a moment...</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    (slowly)<br>
    Coffee...</p>
  <p> We HEAR the replicator work and then DeSeve picks up<br>
    the cup and sniffs it. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The DOORS OPEN and PICARD ENTERS. Through the doors,<br>
    an N.D. SECURITY GUARD can be seen, stationed outside.<br>
    DeSeve automatically snaps to attention out of reflex<br>
    at the sight of a superior.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Commander!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At ease... and it's Captain,<br>
    actually.</p>
  <p> DeSeve relaxes only slightly.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    I'm... sorry, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captains, not Commanders... it's<br>
    been so long since I've... I'll<br>
    remember.</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a moment. DeSeve does seem to<br>
    be a man who's lost and alone, and Picard is not<br>
    unsympathetic. But that is tempered by the knowledge<br>
    that DeSeve's problems are entirely his own doing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You said it was important that I<br>
    see you.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Yes... Captain. I have a message.<br>
    From Ambassador Spock.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to the name.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    He said it involves further...<br>
    &quot;cowboy diplomacy.&quot; He said you<br>
    would understand...</p>
  <p> Picard smiles slightly. After a beat, he indicates a<br>
    chair and they sit.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    There will be a Corvallen<br>
    freighter arriving in the Kaleb<br>
    sector in the next twelve hours.<br>
    Spock wants you to rendezvous with<br>
    that ship and take its cargo back<br>
    to Federation space.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What kind of cargo?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 13.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    He said it was...<br>
    (trying to remember the<br>
    exact words)<br>
    ... &quot;important to the future of the<br>
    Romulans and the Federation.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard studies DeSeve carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is why you've returned... to<br>
    bring this message?</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Partly.</p>
  <p> DeSeve would just as soon leave it at that, but Picard<br>
    waits for him to continue.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In order to know whether Spock's<br>
    message is being delivered<br>
    accurately... I need to<br>
    understand the messenger.</p>
  <p> This is a difficult moment for DeSeve... having to<br>
    admit to a mistake he made a long time ago.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    I was... ready to come back.<br>
    Romulus had... lost its appeal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And yet you found something very<br>
    appealing about it at one time.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    The Romulans are very... moral,<br>
    Captain. They have an absolute<br>
    certainty about what is right and<br>
    what is wrong... who is a friend<br>
    and who is an enemy. They have a<br>
    strict moral compass which<br>
    provides them with a clarity of<br>
    purpose.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I once found their sense of<br>
    purpose, their commitment and<br>
    passion, to be very compelling.</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But not any longer...</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    As I've grown older, I realize<br>
    that clarity of purpose is a more<br>
    ambiguous matter than I had<br>
    thought in my youth.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Picard considers this man. He taps his<br>
    combadge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Mister Riker. Set course for the<br>
    Kaleb sector. Warp eight.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye-aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE WARBIRD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp.</p>
  <p>12 INT. WARBIRD - CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> N'Vek is in a room with several large cargo containers<br>
    stacked against the wall. An N.D. Romulan Centurion<br>
    stands at attention nearby.</p>
  <p> The DOORS OPEN and Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You may wait outside. Make<br>
    certain we are not disturbed.</p>
  <p> The Centurion bows his head and EXITS quickly, relieved<br>
    to be out of Troi's presence. She notes his reaction.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They're all terrified of me.</p>

  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    The purpose of the Tal Shiar is to<br>
    ensure loyalty. To defy them is<br>
    to invite imprisonment... or<br>
    death.</p>
  <p> Deanna does not like the role she's been thrust into.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's time you told me what this is<br>
    all about.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    That is why I called you here.</p>
  <p> N'Vek moves over to one of the cargo containers and<br>
    begins tapping commands into a complex-looking control<br>
    panel.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    This is one of the cargo<br>
    containers we brought on board<br>
    earlier.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's in it?</p>
  <p> N'Vek taps a last command into the control panel and<br>
    the CONTAINER DOOR SLIDES OPEN.</p>
  <p>13 INSIDE THE CARGO CONTAINER</p>
  <p> is the body of a Romulan citizen in an official-looking<br>
    uniform. He is wearing a tech device on his neck.</p>
  <p>14 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Troi reacts, touching his face.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's alive... but in stasis. Who<br>
    is it?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Vice Proconsul M'ret of the<br>
    Imperial Senate...<br>
    (gesturing to other<br>
    containers)<br>
    ... and his two top aides.</p>
  <p> Even Troi has heard of this man.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    M'ret... he's one of the highest<br>
    ranking members of the Romulan<br>
    government...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/20/92 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    His defection will be a profound<br>
    blow to Romulus...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why is he doing this?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    M'ret had questioned the<br>
    repressive activities of the<br>
    government -- and was in danger of<br>
    being imprisoned. He is willing<br>
    to take this risk in order to<br>
    protest Romulan policy and support<br>
    the dissident movement.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You are part of Ambassador Spock's<br>
    underground movement...</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Yes. If we are able to deliver<br>
    M'ret safely, Spock is hopeful<br>
    that we can establish an escape<br>
    route for the thousands of<br>
    dissidents who live in fear of<br>
    their lives.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now you realize why we are willing<br>
    to go to such extraordinary<br>
    lengths -- even kidnapping you --<br>
    to make sure we succeed.</p>
  <p> Troi reflects on this barrage of information.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've given me the identity of a<br>
    Tal Shiar officer... is there a<br>
    real Major Rakal?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/20/92 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    There was. She was killed so that<br>
    you could take her place. Only a<br>
    member of the Tal Shiar would have<br>
    the authority to alter a ship's<br>
    mission.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But -- why me? You could have<br>
    found a Romulan to play this<br>
    role...</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    Yes -- for this part of the plan.<br>
    But if anything goes wrong... we<br>
    will need a Starfleet officer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    There's no need to go into that<br>
    unless it becomes necessary.</p>
  <p> Troi is bothered by the withholding of information, but<br>
    before she can speak --</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    For your own sake, Counselor --<br>
    the less you know about the<br>
    specifics of this plan, the<br>
    better.</p>
  <p> There is a silence while Troi assesses these strange<br>
    events... and her role in them. Finally --</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What is your plan?</p>
  <p> N'Vek briefly works the control panel and closes the<br>
    cargo container, sealing it shut.</p>

  <p> N'VEK<br>
    When we reach the Kaleb sector, we<br>
    will rendezvous with a Corvallen<br>

    containers onto their ship and<br>
    accompany them back to Starfleet<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    The Corvallens are mercenaries...<br>
    Do they know what's in these<br>
    containers?</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    No. They were hired simply to<br>
    take you to Federation space.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> It is her acceptance of the lot she has drawn. N'Vek<br>
    checks the container one last time, making certain it's<br>
    secure.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    We are due in the Ward Room<br>
    shortly. The senior officers<br>
    always dine together.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'll go to my quarters. I think<br>
    it would be best if I stayed away<br>
    from the Commander.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    No, you will be expected to<br>
    attend. I'll go ahead... follow<br>
    me after a few moments. Commander<br>
    Toreth must not feel that anything<br>
    is unusual.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>15 INT. WARBIRD - WARD ROOM</p>
  <p> This is a Conference/Officer's Room which is connected<br>
    by a set of doors to the Bridge. Toreth, N'Vek, and<br>
    two N.D. ROMULAN OFFICERS are seated at a table. A<br>
    large meal is spread out before them. The Commander<br>
    and her officers are friends, and the atmosphere is<br>
    relaxed.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    ... and we had been told that the<br>
    Klingon outpost was undefended.<br>
    So when their warships decloaked,<br>
    they took us completely by<br>
    surprise...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The DOORS OPEN and Troi ENTERS. In an instant, the two<br>
    N.D. officers tense up, completely on edge. Toreth<br>
    indicates an open seat and continues her story.</p>
  <p> Troi bows her head slightly and sits.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... The Klingons destroyed half my<br>
    squadron before we could even<br>
    return fire. But when we did...<br>
    they were no match for us. I<br>
    destroyed their flagship myself.<br>
    I received the Sotarek Citation<br>
    for my actions that day.<br>
    (beat, pointedly)<br>
    The Intelligence Officer in charge<br>
    of the mission was executed.</p>
  <p> The words are followed by an uncomfortable silence.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Major. Welcome to our table.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I suggest you try the viinerine.<br>
    It's quite good.</p>
  <p> Troi is suddenly put on the spot. She has no idea<br>
    which of the various dishes Viinerine actually is...<br>
    but there's no time to try to figure it out. She picks<br>
    up a dish at random and begins spooning some of it onto<br>
    her plate. Toreth smiles mildly.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I realize it's nothing compared to<br>
    what you're accustomed to on<br>
    Romulus... but you could at least<br>
    try the viinerine...</p>
  <p> Troi has picked the wrong dish. She quickly tries to<br>
    cover her mistake and does not stop serving as she<br>
    speaks.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I've smelled better viinerine on<br>
    prison ships.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    No doubt.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/20/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They all continue to eat in silence for a beat. Troi<br>
    wants to avoid conversation as much as possible, but<br>
    Toreth won't let her alone.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Tell me, Major... did you train at<br>
    the Intelligence Academy or the<br>
    Imperial War College?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (hoping it's right)<br>
    The Academy.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Ah -- then you know Commander<br>
    Konsab.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I know of him.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I assume you studied Military<br>
    History with him?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I was wondering what you felt<br>
    about his theory on the<br>
    differences between the military<br>
    and the Tal Shiar?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Which aspects are you referring<br>
    to?</p>
  <p> Toreth stares at her for a moment.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Are you sure you attended class<br>
    regularly, Major? This was one of<br>
    Konsab's main themes.</p>
  <p> Troi takes a bite and chews, scrambling for time.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - 11/17/92 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do you have a point to make,<br>
    Commander? If so, it has escaped<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> Toreth flares slightly, stung.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Commander Konsab believes that, in<br>
    order to function, military<br>
    officers have to trust each other.<br>
    Members of the Tal Shiar, on the<br>
    other hand, trust no one. They<br>
    expect deception, so they always<br>
    find it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've made your opinion of the<br>
    Tal Shiar quite clear, Commander.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I hope so.</p>
  <p> The tension level between Troi and Toreth cranks up a<br>
    notch. Troi feels she must not back down in order to<br>
    maintain credibility.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We ensure the loyalty of the<br>
    people. Do you believe the Empire<br>
    would be better off without our<br>
    protection?</p>
  <p> Troi has pushed a sore spot.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Protection? From whom? Was the<br>
    Empire threatened by the words of<br>
    an old man, a devoted citizen who<br>
    merely tried to speak his mind?<br>
    How did the Tal Shiar protect the<br>
    Empire by dragging my father from<br>
    our home in the middle of the<br>
    night?</p>
  <p> This is extremely hard for Troi. She can feel Toreth's<br>
    intensity and anger, and she sympathizes with her. But<br>
    Troi can't let it show... she has to play her role.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Clearly, your father was a<br>
    traitor.</p>

    No. He was just an idealistic old<br>
    man... and I never saw him again.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't need your devotion,<br>
    Commander. Just your obedience.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    That is all you have.</p>

  <p> PILOT'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander. Sensors are picking up<br>
    an unidentified ship on an<br>

    out.</p>

    It appears to be a freighter,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Hail them.</p>
  <p> Troi says it as an order, not a request... and Toreth<br>
    does not like it one bit. Toreth looks sharply at Troi<br>
    who stares back unflinchingly.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Visual.</p>
  <p> The Viewscreen fills with the image of an ALIEN<br>
    CAPTAIN.</p>
  <p> ALIEN CAPTAIN<br>
    Commander. We are glad to see<br>
    you. We are prepared to transfer<br>
    your cargo as agreed...</p>

  <p>17 ANOTHER ANGLE - TROI &amp; N'VEK</p>
  <p> As the captain speaks, Troi's features change;<br>
    something is troubling her about this man. Something<br>
    is wrong here. She quietly moves to N'Vek.</p>
  <p> TORETH (O.S.)<br>
    With whom do you have this<br>
    &quot;agreement&quot;?</p>
  <p> ALIEN CAPTAIN (O.S.)<br>
    Our arrangements were made with<br>
    Major Rakal. You may rest assured<br>
    that your cargo will be taken<br>
    safely to its destination.<br>

  <p> N'Vek is shocked.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>

    Are you certain?</p>
  <p> Troi silently nods. N'Vek looks up at the Alien<br>

    another word, he moves quickly to a console and taps a<br>
    command.</p>

    How many were aboard that ship?</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Approximately eighteen people,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> The information is devastating; indirectly or not, she<br>
    is responsible for their deaths, but she can't afford<br>
    to show how she really feels. She wants to get off the<br>
    Bridge, get some time to think, but Toreth will not let<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I don't care if there were<br>
    eighteen or eight-hundred.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    On this ship, I give the command<br>
    to fire, Major. You have no right--</p>
  <p> Troi angrily touches the Tal Shiar emblem on her<br>
    shoulder.</p>

  <p> Troi has no alternative in this; to keep them both<br>
    safe, she must defend N'Vek's actions.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I have been given broad<br>
    discretionary powers. Sub-Commander<br>
    N'Vek acted on my<br>

    Tal Shiar. I assure you -- this<br>
    action will not be questioned.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    I will nonetheless make a note in<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Mister DeSeve. You promised<br>
    me a freighter with an important<br>
    cargo. The only thing here is<br>
    empty space. Do you have an<br>

    Sir, he has deceived us.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>

    Yes.<br>

  <p> DESEVE<br>

    directly to him.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him. The story begins to lose<br>
    credibility, and DeSeve realizes that.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>

    He would not have lied.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Was he Romulan?</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Worf's disdain is palpable. DeSeve tries to explain.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    He is a member of the underground --<br>
    a dissident. He risks his life to<br>
    work with those who want a<br>
    different future for Romulus.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, he could be leading us<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would be risky to set a trap<br>

    there is no freighter.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ensign DeSeve, did your contact<br>
    tell you anything else that might<br>
    be helpful?</p>
  <p> There is a long beat.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    The freighter is an old Antaresclass<br>
    vessel... it has limited<br>
    range and speed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It couldn't have taken on its<br>
    cargo more than a day ago... which<br>
    means it has to be within fifteen<br>
    light years of here.</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf stare at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why didn't you mention this<br>
    earlier?</p>
  <p> DeSeve hesitates before answering.</p>
  <p> DESEVE<br>
    It didn't seem necessary. And on<br>
    Romulus, you learn not to<br>
    volunteer information.<br>

    It's a hard habit to break.</p>
  <p> Picard rises and circles the desk, heading for the<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    I do not intend to explain myself<br>
    to you. Set a course.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    In order to reach Draken we will<br>
    have to travel through Federation<br>
    space for nearly twenty hours.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That is not a problem.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Contrary to the propaganda your<br>
    superiors would have us believe,<br>
    Starfleet is neither weak nor<br>
    foolish. The chances of us<br>
    reaching Draken undetected are not<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    We will be cloaked.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>

    The Federation has littered their<br>

    codes for the sensor nets. I will<br>
    provide them if necessary.</p>
  <p> Toreth is very uneasy with this plan.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    That is no guarantee that we will<br>

    surprised. Troi is playing her role to the hilt.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    People blame the military for the<br>
    wars we are asked to fight. But<br>
    I think it is your kind, Major,<br>

  <p> TORETH<br>
    Well, Major... it appears your<br>

    alter that perception.<br>
    (beat; to Pilot)<br>

    There is one possibility. In<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're in stasis...<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Medical team to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Nobody quite knows what's going on... and there is<br>
    still one big question left.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Where's Deanna?</p>
  <p>53 INT. WARBIRD - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> A similar scene of confusion.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Disruptors were ineffective... the<br>
    Enterprise was not damaged. They<br>
    have re-established full shields.</p>
  <p> N'Vek knows exactly what's happened, but he has to<br>
    cover it up.</p>
  <p> N'VEK<br>
    (off console)<br>
    I am reading a malfunction in our<br>
    forward disruptor array... the<br>
    power system has destabilized --</p>
  <p> Toreth moves to N'Vek's station and shoves him out of<br>
    the way. As she checks the console readouts, her look<br>
    hardens -- she sees something isn't right. She turns<br>
    to N'Vek.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    You are lying to me. The<br>
    disruptor beam was purposely<br>
    sabotaged to conceal a transporter<br>
    beam within it.<br>
    (to Pilot)<br>
    Quickly... locate the transport<br>
    coordinates.<br>
    (to N'Vek)<br>
    What have you done?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/24/92 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> N'Vek does not answer. There's a tense beat as the<br>
    Pilot works the console.</p>
  <p> PILOT<br>
    The transporter beam originated<br>
    in... our cargo bay. Something<br>
    was transported from there -- to<br>
    the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Toreth whirls on Troi.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    So. The mysterious cargo...<br>
    brought on board by Major Rakal of<br>
    the Tal Shiar... has now been<br>
    transported to a Starfleet vessel.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It appears we have two traitors in<br>
    our midst.</p>
  <p> Reactions from Troi and N'Vek -- they've been<br>
    discovered. The following events happen quickly:</p>
  <p>53A N'VEK</p>
  <p> reaches for his disruptor.</p>
  <p>53B TORETH</p>
  <p> instinctively reaches for her weapon as well... but it<br>
    isn't there -- it was confiscated earlier. N'Vek<br>
    brings up his weapon, and for an instant it looks as<br>
    though he'll fire on Toreth, and then, suddenly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/24/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>53C N'VEK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is VAPORIZED. Reveal --</p>
  <p>53D THE PILOT</p>
  <p> holding out his disruptor. He looks grimly at Toreth;<br>
    she clasps his shoulder in thanks. The Pilot brings<br>
    his disruptor to bear on Troi.</p>
  <p> Toreth has now fully regained command and she reasserts<br>
    her position on the Bridge. Troi is being guarded by<br>
    the Pilot and an N.D. Romulan, each armed with<br>
    disruptors. Toreth regards her cooly.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Well, Major... now that you can no<br>
    longer take refuge behind the<br>
    shield of the Tal Shiar... it's<br>
    time you answered a few questions.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What was in those cargo<br>
    containers?</p>
  <p> Troi says nothing.</p>
  <p> TORETH<br>
    Not so sure of yourself now, are<br>
    you? Well, no matter. We'll soon<br>
    learn all we need to know.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Then we will execute you.<br>
    (to Pilot)<br>
    Drop shields and cloak the ship.<br>
    Prepare to go to warp.</p>
  <p> And on Troi's reaction --</p>

  <p> as Troi MATERIALIZES on the Transporter Pad. GEORDI is<br>
    there, waiting for her.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Counselor -- are you all right?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (breathless)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's get you to Sickbay...</p>
  <p> And they head for the Exit.</p>
  <p>56 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, get us out of here -- warp<br>

  <p> ENSIGN MCKNIGHT<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>

  <p>64 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Troi sits on a sickbed as Beverly scans her with a<br>
    tricorder. Troi's Romulan features have been removed,<br>
    but she is still in the Tal Shiar uniform. Picard<br>
    stands at the bedside. The three Romulans are in the<br>
    b.g., out of stasis.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think that does it. How does it<br>
    feel to have your own face back?</p>
  <p> Troi sits up and runs her hands gingerly across her<br>
    face and ears.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Just right. Thank you.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles and moves away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The men you helped rescue are<br>
    safe. Proconsul M'ret is deeply<br>
    grateful for your help.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; - REV. 11/19/92 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>64 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The thanks should go to N'vek...<br>
    He sacrificed himself to save<br>
    them... and me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thanks to the two of you, the way<br>
    has been paved for other rescue<br>
    operations.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You can be sure that N'vek's<br>
    efforts... and his sacrifice...<br>
    were not in vain.</p>
  <p> She smiles at him, grateful for the words of comfort.</p>
