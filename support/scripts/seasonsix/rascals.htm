    &quot;Rascals&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A lonely craft against a starry background.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46235.7<br>
    Ensign Ro, Keiko O'Brien, Guinan<br>
    and I are returning to the<br>
    Enterprise after a fascinating<br>
    visit to the planet Marlonia.</p>
  <p>2 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT - IN FLIGHT</p>
  <p> PICARD, GUINAN, KEIKO and RO are in the back of the<br>
    shuttle, relaxing. The atmosphere is very informal.<br>
    Picard is still energized by his recent trip and is<br>
    showing Guinan some odd pieces of pottery from a small<br>
    box.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... and I found these pieces in<br>
    the tertiary level of the dig.<br>
    They're typical of second century<br>
    Marlonian cookware.</p>
  <p> Guinan looks at the shards of pottery... she really<br>
    doesn't share the Captain's interest in this stuff.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Mmmm-hmmmm.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now, see these markings...<br>
    they're very similar to some early<br>
    Taguan designs... but the<br>
    patterns are more intricate...<br>
    closer to Buranian than Taguan.</p>
  <p> Picard looks expectantly at Guinan, but she is less<br>
    than enthused by this revelation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/09/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    So... you went to one of the most<br>
    beautiful planets in this quadrant<br>
    and spent your entire shore<br>
    leave... in a cave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was a very rewarding<br>
    experience.<br>
    (holds up shards)<br>
    Look at these fragments... they're<br>
    in nearly perfect condition...<br>
    and they're over seven hundred<br>
    years old.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    So's my father.</p>
  <p> Picard can see he's not going to win any converts here,<br>
    so he carefully puts the shards back in his box.</p>
  <p>3 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Ro is looking at the collection of bagged plants that<br>
    Keiko is holding in a small tray.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (indicates one plant)<br>
    Is that a Draebidium Froctus?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Draebidium Calimus actually...<br>
    you can tell by the shape of the<br>
    leaves.</p>
  <p> Ro nods and turns back to the console. But Keiko<br>
    suddenly realizes something.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I didn't know you were interested<br>
    in plant biology.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (a little embarrassed)<br>
    I... took a class at the<br>
    Academy... I just remember a few<br>
    things...</p>
  <p> Before Keiko can pursue this any further, Ro is saved<br>
    by Worf's Com Voice.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/08/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Enterprise to Shuttlecraft<br>
    Fermi...</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (works)<br>
    This is the Fermi. Go ahead<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have just received a distress<br>
    signal from the Starfleet science<br>
    team on Ligos Seven.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any indication of the problem?</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    No, sir. The call was cut off<br>
    mid-transmission.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lay in a course and prepare to<br>
    engage at Warp eight once we're<br>
    aboard.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The transition to 'business' is immediate and absolute.<br>
    Picard looks to Ro.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    We'll rendezvous with the ship<br>
    in three minutes, sir.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle is confronted by a bright FLASH that erupts<br>
    directly in the craft's path. The light quickly fades<br>
    leaving only an incandescent CLOUD-LIKE ANOMALY in its<br>
    wake.</p>
  <p> As the shuttle approaches the anomaly, its vapors<br>
    quickly enveloping the craft...</p>
  <p>5 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There's a sudden JOLT and the craft begins to SHAKE,<br>
    caught in the grip of some phenomenon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/08/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard and Ro quickly move to the pilot area and start<br>
    to work the console.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    (reading instruments)<br>
    We're caught in some kind of<br>
    energy field.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hard about, full impulse.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard, Keiko, Guinan and Ro, buffeted about. WHIRR,<br>
    the power goes down. Red warning LIGHTS flash, a<br>
    KLAXON sounds.</p>
  <p>6<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    7</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at impulse power.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations, various<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    What's happening, Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The shuttle's been enveloped by<br>
    an energy field, sir.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF (Cont'd)<br>
    Their engines and life support<br>
    have failed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Conn officer)<br>
    Increase to full impulse.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Bridge to Transporter Room Three.<br>
    Prepare to beam the shuttle crew<br>
    aboard once we're in range.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN'S COM VOICE<br>
    Ready, sir.</p>
  <p>10 OMITTED</p>
  <p>11 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Red alert... all power gone... the SHAKING is really<br>
    VIOLENT now.</p>
  <p> RO<br>
    There's too much interference...<br>
    I can't contact the Enterprise...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Transfer auxiliary power to the<br>
    inertial dampers...</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Warning. Structural failure<br>
    imminent.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the ENERGY FIELD penetrates the hull and<br>
    fills the inside of the shuttle. Everyone reacts...</p>
  <p>12 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien working feverishly at the controls.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    O'Brien, do you have them?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/09/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    I'm trying, sir... I can't get<br>
    a pattern lock.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    The shuttle's coming apart, Chief.<br>
    You've got to do it now.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I've got them.<br>
    (works)<br>
    There's a forty percent drop in<br>
    mass. I may have lost one of<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> He works and FOUR SMALL FIGURES begin to MATERIALIZE on<br>
    the platform.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE ON O'BRIEN</p>
  <p> A low angle looking up at O'Brien from the POV of the<br>
    Transporter platform. He reacts with shock to what<br>
    he sees.</p>
  <p>14 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing that the entire shuttle crew has now been<br>
    turned into twelve year old children. YOUNG PICARD,<br>
    YOUNG RO, YOUNG GUINAN, and YOUNG KEIKO all wear the<br>
    same clothes the adults wore in the shuttle, but now<br>
    they're a few sizes too big for them. For a split<br>
    second, Young Picard is unaware of what's happened.<br>
    (NOTE: Young Keiko is now carrying a tray of sprouted<br>
    seedlings.)</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Mister O'Brien.<br>
    Another moment and...</p>
  <p> He trails off at the sound of his own voice. He and<br>
    the others look at each other in shock. Off their<br>
    reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/11/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>15 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> BEVERLY, medical tricorder in hand, finishes her<br>
    examination of Young Picard. Troi is with her. In the<br>
    b.g., Young Ro, Young Guinan and Young Keiko sit on<br>
    biobeds while an N.D. conducts tests with a tricorder.<br>
    NOTE: &quot;child&quot; versions now wear smaller, replicated<br>
    clothes, with normal sized insignias. They are still<br>
    examining the fit of their new clothes.</p>
  <p> As the &quot;grown ups&quot; talk, we can see Young Picard grow<br>
    impatient as they talk above and about him, as if he<br>
    weren't even there. Beverly is reporting to Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    According to the bio-scans, their<br>
    DNA structures are now consistent<br>
    with those of pre-adolescents.<br>
    But as far as I can tell, only<br>
    their bodies have changed.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (off PADD)<br>
    Their individual intelligence and<br>
    behavioral responses are all<br>
    exactly the same as they were<br>
    before the accident.</p>
  <p> Young Picard finally intercedes.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    What happened to the shuttlecraft,<br>
    Number One?</p>
  <p> Riker looks down, blinks for a moment as if to remind<br>
    himself that this is Jean-Luc Picard, and then answers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/11/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The shuttle broke up just after<br>
    we beamed you out. Data's<br>
    coordinating the salvage effort<br>
    right now.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What about the energy field the<br>
    shuttle passed through?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We've been trying to scan it, but<br>
    it's putting out a lot of<br>
    interference. It's going to take<br>
    some time.</p>
  <p> Again Young Picard makes them include him in this<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    We can't afford to stay here any<br>
    longer. We'll leave a class four<br>
    probe behind to study the energy<br>
    field but the distress signal<br>
    from Ligos Seven has top priority.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Let me know as soon as you have<br>
    any further information, Doctor.<br>
    Number One, you're with me.</p>
  <p> Young Picard heads for the door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain... there are some<br>
    additional tests I'd like to<br>
    run...</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Of course...<br>
    (to other 'children')<br>
    The three of you will remain as<br>
    needed to assist Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> Young Picard EXITS with Riker. As Troi and Beverly<br>
    exchange a look of concern...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>16 ANGLE - YOUNG RO AND YOUNG GUINAN</p>
  <p> Young Ro sits on her biobed obviously not pleased with<br>
    any of this. She opens and closes her fingers, not<br>
    quite able to realize that these are now her hands.<br>
    Young Guinan is more serene as usual and seems to be<br>
    taking this all with a slight air of amusement. She<br>
    studies Young Ro for a beat, who finally notices.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    You know... you make a pretty<br>
    cute kid.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    Great. Just what I want to be...<br>
    cute.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    Were you this much fun when you<br>
    were a kid?</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    I was in a refugee camp. &quot;Fun&quot;<br>
    wasn't exactly in my vocabulary.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    What about now? You're not in<br>
    that camp anymore.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    &quot;Fun&quot; is being back at work...<br>
    in my own uniform.</p>
  <p> On Young Guinan's reaction...</p>
  <p>17 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Riker and Young Picard ENTER.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> They stand side by side, an awkward and silent moment<br>
    for both of them. Riker can't help glancing down at<br>
    this youthful version of the man he's known and served<br>
    under for six years. The Turbolift finally STOPS and<br>
    the doors open.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/08/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>18 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data, GEORDI, and Worf are at their stations along with<br>
    N.D. Crewmembers. Young Picard and Riker ENTER from<br>
    the Turbolift. Young Picard moves directly to Worf,<br>
    who looks down with astonishment at his captain.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf. Prepare to launch<br>
    a class four probe to study the<br>
    energy field.</p>
  <p> Worf is unable to respond for a moment and Young Picard<br>
    suddenly becomes aware of a great silence on the<br>
    Bridge. He looks around and sees that every highly<br>
    disciplined head is gaping at their captain.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (to everyone)<br>
    I realize how unusual this must<br>
    seem...<br>
    (just the facts)<br>
    My appearance is the result of<br>
    an accident, involving myself and<br>
    three other crew members... the<br>
    effects of which Doctor Crusher<br>
    is currently working to remedy.<br>
    (in charge)<br>
    I assure you, I am Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Riker nods his assent and everyone returns to their<br>
    duties. Young Picard looks expectantly at Worf for<br>
    a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    The probe. Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> He turns to work at his console as Beverly ENTERS from<br>
    a Turbolift in the b.g.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, have you secured all<br>
    of the shuttle debris?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Almost, sir. It is being stored<br>
    in Shuttlebay Two.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Very well.<br>
    (to Conn)<br>
    Ensign, as soon as Mister Data<br>
    is finished take us to Ligos at<br>
    warp eight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly quietly moves next to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, may I see you privately<br>
    for a few moments?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> They EXIT to the Ready Room.</p>
  <p>19 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Beverly and the young Captain ENTER. Young Picard is<br>
    in charge, trying to continue on in his normal fashion.<br>
    He moves to the replicator.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.<br>
    (he gets the cup of tea)<br>
    Have you been able to determine<br>
    the cause of our transformation?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not yet. I'm still waiting for<br>
    some test results.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> Young Picard sits down at the desk and turns on the<br>
    terminal.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (off terminal)<br>
    There are one hundred and three<br>
    members of the science team on<br>
    Ligos Seven. We should prepare<br>
    shuttlebay three for a triage<br>
    center in case they have large<br>
    numbers of casualties.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Ligos Seven is prone to periodic<br>
    volcanic activity... perhaps the<br>
    planet has entered an active<br>
    phase---</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc.<br>
    (he looks up)<br>
    I think we need to talk.</p>
  <p> Young Picard knows what she's getting at and he faces<br>
    her head-on.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    All right. Let's talk.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Are you here to relieve me of<br>
    duty?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd rather not have to take that<br>
    step.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I am still Jean-Luc Picard. My<br>
    judgement, my experiences, my<br>
    mental capacities are all<br>
    intact.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's true... for now. This<br>
    could be the first stage of a<br>
    condition which may begin to<br>
    affect your mind as well.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    But you've seen no evidence of<br>
    that?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not yet.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What I do know is that the Captain<br>
    of this ship has just gone through<br>
    an extreme physical<br>
    transformation... the ultimate<br>
    effects of which I can't even<br>
    begin to guess.</p>

  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    You are asking me to step down.</p>
  <p> There is a quiet beat before Beverly replies.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're still Jean-Luc Picard...<br>
    what do you think you should do?</p>
  <p> As Young Picard thinks over the stakes involved...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>20 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before. Young Picard and Beverly ENTER from the<br>
    Ready Room. He goes directly to Riker and there is no<br>
    trace of hesitation or regret at his decision.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (formally)<br>
    Commander Riker, please take<br>
    command of the ship until further<br>
    notice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood, sir.</p>
  <p> And with that, Young Picard and Beverly head for the<br>
    EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>21 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Young Ro and Young Guinan ENTER from Sickbay. Young Ro<br>
    is very irritated as they pause in the Corridor.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    So what the hell am I supposed<br>
    to do now?</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    You're not supposed to do<br>
    anything. That's what &quot;relieved<br>
    of duty&quot; means.</p>
  <p> Young Guinan looks up at the ceiling... jumps up and<br>
    tries to touch it, but can't. She smiles in delight.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    Well, I should be doing<br>
    something... instead of just<br>
    standing around waiting for them<br>
    to find a cure.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    You're right.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's go play.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    I haven't been young for a long<br>
    time... and I intend to enjoy<br>
    every minute of it.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    Fine. Enjoy yourself.</p>
  <p> Young Ro heads down the Corridor toward a Turbolift.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    (following her)<br>
    What are you going to do... go<br>
    back to your room and pout?</p>
  <p> Young Ro stops dead in her tracks and turns on Young<br>
    Guinan.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    I am not twelve years old. If<br>
    I want to go to my quarters and<br>
    contemplate my situation, it does<br>
    not mean that I am... pouting.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    Okay, okay.</p>
  <p> Young Ro turns and continues toward the Turbolift.<br>
    Young Guinan makes a face at Young Ro's back... then<br>
    smiles to herself with the simple pleasure of acting<br>
    like a girl again... then she follows Young Ro.</p>
  <p>22 INT. O'BRIEN QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Young Keiko and O'Brien sit on the couch. There is a<br>
    long, awkward silence between them as they struggle to<br>
    make sense of the situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    ( awkward)<br>
    I could use a... cup of coffee.<br>
    How about you?</p>
  <p> It's obvious O'Brien's more in need of a distraction<br>
    than any beverage. He moves to get up, but Young Keiko<br>
    gestures him back into his chair and walks over to the<br>
    replicator...</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    I'll get it.<br>
    (to companel)<br>
    Two coffees... one with cream...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (interjects)<br>
    Black... double sweet...</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    I know.<br>
    (to companel)<br>
    One double sweet.</p>
  <p> Young Keiko picks up the two cups of steaming coffee<br>
    and starts toward O'Brien.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Careful... that's hot...</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    (a warning)<br>
    Miles...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sorry.</p>
  <p> Young Keiko hands him a cup and sits down next to him.<br>
    A sadness falls over her features... this is a lot to<br>
    absorb. Young Keiko instinctively cuddles up next to<br>
    him, looking for comfort. But this has the opposite<br>
    effect on O'Brien. He stands up... suddenly very<br>
    uncomfortable with this kind of intimacy.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It's... I don't know... but this<br>
    feels wrong, somehow.</p>
  <p> Young Keiko stands. Their voices slowly get louder as<br>
    they grapple with complex emotions.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    Miles Edward O'Brien. I am still<br>
    your wife.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Technically, yes.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    Technically?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No. I mean, of course you're my<br>
    wife... but you're also ten years<br>
    old.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    Beverly said it's actually closer<br>
    to twelve.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    That's not the point.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    So what is the point? Is our<br>
    marriage over?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I didn't say that. But until they<br>
    find a way to reverse this... this<br>
    effect... it's going to be hard<br>
    for me to ignore the fact that<br>
    you're a little girl.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    What if they can't find a way?<br>
    What if I'm like this the rest<br>
    of my life? What does that mean<br>
    for us, for our family?</p>
  <p> MOLLY'S VOICE<br>
    Mommy?</p>
  <p> They both look toward the bedroom. After a beat, they<br>
    both move to the door.</p>
  <p>23 INT. MOLLY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> MOLLY is lying in her bed as O'Brien and Young Keiko<br>
    ENTER.</p>

  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (to Molly)<br>
    What's wrong, Sweetheart?</p>
  <p> MOLLY<br>
    I want Mommy to read me a story.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    All right. What story would you<br>
    like to hear?</p>
  <p> Molly just looks at her.</p>
  <p> MOLLY<br>
    I want Mommy.</p>
  <p> The words knife into Young Keiko and she doesn't know<br>
    what to do for a moment. O'Brien smoothly moves to his<br>
    daughter. Young Keiko leaves the room.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    What if Daddy reads you a story<br>
    tonight? Will that be okay?</p>
  <p> Molly nods her head.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'll be right back.</p>
  <p> O'Brien EXITS.</p>
  <p>24 INT. O'BRIEN QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Young Keiko is fighting back tears as O'Brien ENTERS.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Keiko...</p>
  <p> Young Keiko turns around and buries her head in<br>
    O'Brien's chest. He comforts her, just as he would any<br>
    crying twelve year old.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It's going to be all right... I<br>
    promise... we'll work this out...</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>25 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship drops out of warp.</p>
  <p> RIKER (V.O.)<br>
    First Officer's Log: Supplemental.<br>
    The Enterprise has reached the<br>
    Ligos system, and we have begun<br>
    to search for the missing<br>
    Federation science team. Doctor<br>
    Crusher reports no progress on<br>
    finding a cure for the members<br>
    of the shuttle crew.</p>
  <p>26 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Young Picard is looking at himself in the mirror,<br>
    wearing his black T-shirt... staring at the strange,<br>
    yet familiar face he sees. He turns his head this way<br>
    and that... touches places under his eyes and around<br>
    his mouth where only yesterday there were small lines<br>
    of age. He hesitates for a moment... finally runs a<br>
    hand through the shock of hair on his head. He grins<br>
    at the image.</p>
  <p> He moves to a chair and picks up his leather jacket and<br>
    tries it on. The jacket is several sizes too large now<br>
    and Young Picard can't help but laugh at the comical<br>
    image of himself in the mirror.</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS. Young Picard is obviously in good spirits<br>
    and Troi smiles at the sight of the boy in the man's<br>
    clothes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I came to see how you're doing.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (re: jacket)<br>
    I'll have to speak to my tailor,<br>
    but otherwise I'm well, thank you.</p>
  <p> Troi stands beside him and they both examine the way he<br>
    looks in the mirror.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    It's just so... ridiculous. I<br>
    can't really take myself seriously<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> He trails off as a new thought occurs to him. The<br>
    smile on his face dies away and is replaced by a frown.<br>
    He turns away from the mirror, troubled.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Counselor... if Doctor Crusher<br>
    can't find a cure... and I have<br>
    to stay this way... no one's going<br>
    to take me seriously, are they?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I would say the people who know<br>
    you, who've worked with you for<br>
    years, will be able to make the<br>
    adjustment eventually.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But... there are some cultures<br>
    that would not accept a<br>
    twelve-year-old captain as a<br>
    negotiating partner or a credible<br>
    emissary.</p>
  <p> Young Picard takes a long beat to consider this.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    In that case, I suppose I'll have<br>
    to wait until... I grow up again<br>
    before I'll get another command.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That could be ten years... maybe<br>
    fifteen...</p>
  <p> Young Picard mulls this over for a moment... it's a<br>
    long time.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    The question is... what to do<br>
    until then?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You're still a captain... I'm sure<br>
    there are other assignments you<br>
    could be given.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I've spent thirty years of my life<br>
    aboard starships... I'm not about<br>
    to sit behind a desk now.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You could return to the Academy...<br>
    get another degree... brush up<br>
    on your Latin.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (wry)<br>
    And be Wesley's room-mate, I<br>
    suppose.<br>
    (they both smile)<br>
    I will admit that returning to<br>
    the Academy does have a certain<br>
    appeal... but I've always spent<br>
    my life looking forward... going<br>
    to the Academy again feels like...<br>
    looking back.</p>
  <p> Troi moves around the room... sees the usual artifacts<br>
    from Picard's journeys: the Mintakan blanket, Klingon<br>
    knife, and now the pottery shards from Marlonia.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Then perhaps you could use this<br>
    time to explore another interest...<br>
    archeology for instance?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Leave Starfleet?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Not permanently... just a<br>
    sabbatical. You could spend ten<br>
    years crawling through caves and<br>
    digging up artifacts... and still<br>
    have enough time to become the<br>
    youngest admiral in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Young Picard moves to the pottery shards and looks down<br>
    at them.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    It would give me a chance to<br>
    accompany Doctor Langford on her<br>
    exploration of the ruins on Suvin<br>
    Four... but to leave the<br>
    Enterprise...</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In a way, you're very lucky. You<br>
    have a chance do what most people<br>
    can only dream about... have a<br>
    second childhood without the pain<br>
    of growing up.</p>
  <p> But Young Picard isn't listening any longer... he's<br>
    picked up one of the shards of pottery and is turning<br>
    it over in the light. Troi smiles to herself and<br>
    quietly EXITS.</p>

  <p>27 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Beverly is showing Riker an Okudagram display of some<br>
    medical information.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is Captain Picard's<br>
    rybo-viroxic-nucleic structure<br>
    from a tissue sample I took this<br>
    morning. It's the same as a sample<br>
    I took before the accident --<br>
    except it's missing several key<br>
    viroxic sequences.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm afraid it's been a long time<br>
    since I took genetics, Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    RVN is one of the key factors in<br>
    our development during puberty.<br>
    Unlike DNA, which never changes,<br>
    RVN takes on additional viroxic<br>
    sequences during adolescence.<br>
    Those sequences determine how we<br>
    develop physically. Without<br>
    them...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We would never mature into adults.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exactly. Somehow, those key<br>
    sequences were eliminated in<br>
    the Captain and the others<br>
    during transport.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the terminal for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So what can we do?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There are a couple of options.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves over to some SPROUTED SEEDLINGS in petri<br>
    dishes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    These are the plants Keiko was<br>
    carrying on the shuttle. Whatever<br>
    turned the crew into children<br>
    turned these into seedlings.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/10/92 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly nods and moves to a FLOWERING PLANT identical<br>
    to the one seen earlier in the shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    We accelerated the growth on<br>
    one of them, and it developed<br>
    into a perfectly normal adult<br>
    plant.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't suppose that would work<br>
    on people.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... but it does tell us that<br>
    if we do nothing, they'll probably<br>
    grow up as they did before.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's one option...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I do have adult RVN patterns<br>
    on all four of them. I might<br>
    be able to send them back<br>
    through the Transporter pattern<br>
    buffer and replace the missing<br>
    sequences... but we can't even<br>
    attempt that until we know why<br>
    this happened in the first place.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If they were, somehow, to lose<br>
    more viroxic sequences...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    They'd come back even younger.</p>

  <p> What is left of the shuttlecraft is now a lot of junk<br>
    sitting on the deck of the bay. O'Brien and a few N.D.<br>
    ENGINEERS are re-assembling the components of the<br>
    shuttle in some rough order -- like the positioning of<br>
    debris after a plane crash. O'Brien examines a piece<br>
    of debris with a tricorder... he then moves it into<br>
    its proper place on the deck. Geordi ENTERS, carrying<br>
    a PADD.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've got the sensor report on the<br>

    near the starboard bulkhead.</p>
  <p> O'Brien nods in agreement.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (indicates debris)<br>
    There are some bulkhead fragments<br>

    and watching you sulk.</p>
  <p> Young Guinan gets out of the chair and starts moving<br>
    around the room, picking up random objects and playing<br>
    with things.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    This isn't some kind of glorious<br>
    second childhood, Guinan. Our<br>
    bodies have been violated...<br>
    changed... doesn't that bother<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    Sure it bothers me, but at the<br>
    moment I can't do anything about<br>
    it. So I might as well enjoy it.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    Enjoy what? Where did you get<br>
    the idea that being short and<br>
    awkward is some kind of wonderful<br>
    gift?</p>
  <p> Young Guinan looks at Young Ro for a beat, then goes<br>
    over to sit by her on the bed.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    There must've been some part of<br>
    childhood that you didn't loathe.<br>
    Come on... tell me one happy<br>
    memory you have.</p>

  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    Look. It was a long, depressing<br>
    period of my life and I was<br>
    grateful when it was finally<br>
    over. I'd rather not relive it.</p>
  <p> Young Guinan considers her for a moment.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    I bet you were a jumper.<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    A jumper. You know, someone who<br>
    jumped up and down on furniture<br>
    all the time.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    You were a jumper all right. The<br>
    quiet ones... they always look<br>
    so innocent... you think you can<br>
    turn your back on them... then<br>
    next thing you know -- bam!<br>
    They're bouncing on the bed.</p>
  <p> Young Ro smiles in disbelief at the outrageous nature<br>
    of Young Guinan's statement.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    That is the most ridiculous thing<br>
    I've ever heard. Most of the time<br>
    I didn't even have a bed.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    Ah... but you did have one<br>
    sometimes... and I bet you jumped<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    I most certainly did not.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    Yeah... I can see it in your<br>
    eyes... you can barely resist the<br>
    urge to leap up and start jumping<br>
    around like a Tarkassian<br>
    razorbeast.</p>

    Oh yeah... oh yeah...</p>
  <p> Young Guinan suddenly stands up on the bed and starts<br>
    jumping up and down. Young Ro can't believe this...<br>
    but she's smiling in spite of herself as the bed is<br>
    violently shaken underneath her.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    This is ridiculous.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    (jumping)<br>
    That's right... and don't you dare<br>
    join me, Ro Laren. You don't like<br>
    jumping on beds!</p>
  <p> Young Ro gets off the bed... watches the maniacal<br>
    jumping of Young Guinan for another beat... her smile<br>
    grows wider and wider... finally she can't resist any<br>
    longer and she leaps up and joins in. As the two of<br>
    them giggle and laugh as they bounce up and down...</p>

    We think the shuttle was caught<br>
    in a molecular reversion field,<br>
    which caused the structure of the<br>
    ship to deteriorate. When the<br>
    field penetrated the hull, it also<br>
    began to affect the shuttle crew.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    When I tried to beam them off,<br>

  <p>61 INT. SCHOOL ROOM</p>
  <p> Young Ro and Young Keiko are taking apart a small<br>
    section of bulkhead at one end of the room.</p>
  <p>62 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Young Picard and Young Guinan are at the desktop<br>
    computer terminal seen earlier.</p>
  <p> Young Picard activates the school-room terminal.<br>
    Because this is the school room, a DIFFERENT Computer<br>
    Voice than the one we're used to hearing responds when<br>
    he turns on the terminal.</p>
  <p> NEW COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    (sweetly)<br>
    Hello. I'm the classroom<br>
    computer system. What can I do<br>
    for you, today?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Computer, display interior<br>
    security grid.</p>

    (sweetly)<br>
    I'm sorry, but I can't do that.<br>
    Would you like to play a game?</p>

    No, I would not.<br>

  <p> NEW COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    I'm sorry, but I can't do that.<br>
    Would you like to see some<br>
    interesting animals?</p>
  <p> Young Picard glares at the screen in frustration, but<br>
    Young Guinan intercedes.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    It's a child's computer, remember?<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer, can you show me a<br>
    picture of the inside of the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> A BRIGHTLY COLORED diagram of the Enterprise comes up<br>
    on the screen. NOTE: this should not be one of our<br>
    standard schematics. It should be a children's version<br>
    of a ship diagram, with greatly simplified graphics<br>
    and brightly colored designs.</p>
  <p> NEW COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    The Enterprise is a Galaxy-class<br>

  <p> The Voice STOPS.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>

    All right, this will have to<br>
    do... we're here... there's a<br>
    service conduit that runs from<br>
    here to here and then connects<br>
    to a Jeffries Tube here... but<br>
    you and Ensign Ro will still have<br>
    to cross this corridor before you<br>
    can get to Main Engineering.</p>

  <p> Young Guinan and Young Ro EXIT to the Jeffries Tube.</p>
  <p>64 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As a TOY suddenly bumps up against Young Picard's leg.<br>
    Alexander comes running up, carrying a remote control PADD<br>
    and looking apologetic. The toy looks like a cross<br>
    between a lunch-box and a spider, with several<br>
    odd-looking armatures poking out from the sides. There<br>
    are no apparent wheels, but it glides along the floor.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I'm sorry... Captain.</p>
  <p> Alexander moves the toy away from Young Picard and begins<br>
    playing with it again by using the remote control. As<br>
    Young Picard watches the toy glide across the floor, he<br>
    begins to get an idea. He goes to Alexander.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Alexander, would you mind if I...<br>
    borrowed your toy for a little<br>
    while?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> He hands the remote to Young Picard, who takes it and<br>
    then EXITS to the tube along with Young Keiko.</p>

  <p>68 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> FERENGI #1 is standing behind the console. The doors<br>
    OPEN and the toy seen earlier ENTERS the room. The<br>
    Ferengi looks at it in puzzlement for a moment... then<br>
    the toy EXITS again.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi waits a beat... then decides to follow<br>
    it... he EXITS.</p>
  <p>69 INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The Ferengi ENTERS from the Transporter Room just in<br>
    time to see the toy disappear around the corner. He<br>
    follows it.</p>
  <p> As the Ferengi turns the corner, Young Picard and Young<br>
    Keiko peek around the corner and then quickly EXIT to<br>
    the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>70 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Young Picard -- carrying the remote control seen<br>
    earlier -- and Young Keiko ENTER. Young Keiko moves<br>
    quickly to the storage lockers on the far side of the<br>
    room while Young Picard moves to the Transporter<br>
    Console and starts to rapidly enter information into<br>
    the console. Young Keiko opens the locker and removes<br>
    several PHASERS.</p>
  <p> The remote control PADD Young Picard is carrying<br>
    suddenly BEEPS.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (off PADD)<br>
    He's picked up the toy.</p>
  <p> Young Picard rapidly finishes his work and Young Keiko<br>
    closes the locker, with several phasers in her arms.<br>
    They run OUT the doors.</p>
  <p> A few beats pass and then Ferengi #1 ENTERS, carrying<br>
    the toy. He sets the toy aside in irritation and then<br>
    turns his back on it.</p>
  <p>70A CLOSE ON TOY</p>
  <p> From this angle, we can now see that there is a<br>
    COMBADGE attached to it.</p>

  <p> Young Ro and Young Guinan are moving quickly down the<br>
    tube on their hands and knees.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    This is the first time these<br>
    Jeffries tubes haven't seemed<br>
    cramped.</p>

  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    How much farther do we have to<br>
    go?</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    About fifty meters... don't tell<br>
    me you're tired.</p>
  <p> YOUNG GUINAN<br>
    I'm not as young as I used to be.</p>
  <p> Young Ro stops and they look at each other for a beat.</p>
  <p>71A INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> FERENGI #2 is on guard duty here... but he's pretty<br>
    bored at this point and is sitting at Beverly's desk,<br>
    toying with some of the items on the desk.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Alexander ENTERS from the Corridor doors.<br>
    He creeps up to the glass window and then taps on the<br>
    glass before running back out into the Corridor.</p>
  <p> Ferengi #2 whirls around, but doesn't see anything. He<br>
    immediately gets up and heads for the Corridor.</p>
  <p>71B INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As the Ferengi EXITS to the Corridor... Alexander<br>
    ENTERS from the other door to Sickbay. He quickly<br>
    moves to a storage bin and begins pulling out<br>
    hyposprays. Once he has as many as he can carry, he<br>
    runs back OUT of the room.</p>

  <p>74 INT. SCHOOL ROOM</p>
  <p> Alexander comes scrambling out of the Jeffries Tube,<br>
    with hyposprays. Young Picard and Young Keiko are<br>
    there to meet them.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Report.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Mission accomplished, sir. The<br>
    one in Sickbay never saw me.</p>
  <p> Alexander hands the hyposprays to Young Picard, who<br>
    in turn, hands one to Young Keiko.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Very good.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I'd say we're ready. Have you<br>
    figured out how to get to the<br>

  <p> Young Picard frowns... he's definitely not looking<br>

  <p>75 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Berik is still standing guard in the Corridor outside<br>
    the school room. The doors OPEN and Young Picard<br>
    ENTERS the corridor. Berik levels his phaser at him.</p>
  <p> BERIK<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> Young Picard adopts a petulant little boy attitude.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I need to see my father.</p>
  <p> BERIK<br>
    Go back inside.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I need to see him right now.</p>
  <p> BERIK<br>
    Do not argue with me. Go back<br>
    inside.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I need him now! Now! Now! Now!</p>
  <p> Berik grabs him by the shoulder, but Young Picard pulls<br>
    away and pretends to be hurt.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    You hurt me! I want my father!<br>
    I want my father!</p>
  <p> Berik doesn't know how to react to this screaming<br>
    child... finally gives in.</p>
  <p> BERIK<br>
    All right. Just stop that.</p>
  <p> He grabs Young Picard and hauls him to the Turbolift.</p>

  <p> BERIK<br>
    (exasperated)<br>
    Here he is. Now be quiet!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's going on?</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (awkward)<br>
    So... son. How are you?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I'm okay.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And what about your friends...<br>
    Keiko and Guinan and Ro?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    They're okay too. But...</p>
  <p> He sighs, pretends to be sad about something.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's wrong?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    We don't have anything to do...<br>
    none of the games are working.</p>
  <p> A look between the two of them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know. The Ferengi made Daddy<br>
    turn off the main computer.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Can't you just turn on the kid's<br>
    computer in Schoolroom Eight?<br>
    We just want to play a few games.</p>

  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't know if they'll let me<br>
    do that, Jean-Luc, but I'll ask.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (brightens)<br>
    Thanks, Number One.</p>
  <p> Berik's head snaps around at this un-sonlike response.<br>
    But Young Picard quickly catches himself.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    (to Berik)<br>
    He's my Number One Daddy.</p>
  <p> Riker and Young Picard both glance at Berik... and<br>

    Suddenly the doors open and Young Picard is shoved INTO<br>
    the room by Berik.</p>
  <p> YOUNG KEIKO<br>
    How did it go?</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    He understood.<br>

    We should have access very soon.</p>
  <p>80 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Lurin is peering at Picard's fish with interest... he<br>
    gropes about with his hand, looking for a way to reach<br>
    inside. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Riker, escorted by Morta, ENTERS. Lurin's eyes narrow<br>
    and he gives Riker an evil smile.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    I understand your... son was here<br>
    to see you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    We Ferengi do not bring our<br>
    offspring along with us aboard<br>
    ships.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then I suppose that's your loss.<br>
    We consider our families to be<br>
    one of our strengths.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I think you will find they can<br>
    also be a weakness.<br>
    (beat, then firm)<br>
    Unless you release the computer<br>
    to our control, I will execute<br>
    every child on this ship...<br>
    beginning with yours.</p>
  <p> Riker appears outraged.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>80 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Even you aren't that cruel.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    It is cruel to put children in<br>
    danger by bringing them aboard<br>
    a starship in the first place.</p>
  <p> Riker takes a step toward Lurin, but Morta jabs the<br>
    phaser in his back and he stops. A tense moment...<br>
    then Riker's bravado seems to collapse into weariness<br>
    and resignation.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... all right... just<br>
    don't harm my son.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    (with relish)<br>
    You will release the computer and<br>
    show Morta exactly how to use it.</p>
  <p> Riker nods reluctantly and Morta shows him out of the<br>
    room with pleasure.</p>
  <p>81 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker and Morta ENTER from the Ready Room. They go to<br>

    Command functions restored.</p>
  <p> The monitor at the station LIGHTS UP. Riker turns to<br>
    Morta and begins to point at things on the screen and<br>
    talks very fast, while making ridiculous-sounding<br>
    things up in an effort to confuse him.</p>

  <p>81 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Okay, Morta. The Enterprise<br>
    computer system is controlled by<br>
    three primary main processing<br>
    cores cross linked with a<br>
    redundant melacortz ramistat and<br>
    fourteen kiloquad interface<br>
    modules. The core elements are<br>
    based on FTL nanoprocessor units<br>

    bilateral kelilactirals with<br>
    twenty of those units being slaved<br>

    You do know what a bilateral<br>
    kelilactiral is, don't you?</p>
  <p> Morta is lost, but unwilling to admit it.</p>
  <p> MORTA<br>
    Of course I do, human. I am not<br>
    stupid.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, of course not.<br>
    (points to something<br>
    on console)<br>
    Now this is the isopalavial<br>
    interface which controls the main<br>
    firomactal drive unit.<br>
    (slaps Morta's hand<br>
    away)<br>
    Don't touch that, you'll blow up<br>
    the entire firomactal drive.</p>
  <p> MORTA<br>
    What? Wait.<br>
    (confused beat)<br>
    What is... what is a firomactal?</p>
  <p> Riker just gives him an astonished look.</p>
  <p> MORTA<br>
    (embarrassed)<br>
    Just explain it to me.</p>
  <p> Riker takes on an air of infinite patience. He points<br>
    to something to Morta's left.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That is the firomactal drive<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/08/92 - ACT FIVE 60A.</p>
  <p>85 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Alexander smiles and heads for the door to the<br>
    corridor.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>86 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Berik is still standing guard outside the school room.<br>
    The door OPENS and Alexander ENTERS. Berik is<br>
    immediately wary.</p>
  <p> BERIK<br>
    (harsh)<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    I found this in the school room.<br>
    Is it yours?</p>
  <p> He hands him a combadge. He looks at it for a quick<br>
    beat, then DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/08/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>87 OMITTED</p>
  <p>87A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> A FERENGI is guarding a corridor intersection.<br>
    Suddenly, a hypospray reaches up from behind the<br>
    Ferengi and is pressed against his neck.</p>
  <p> The Ferengi reacts... then FALLS to the deck,<br>
    unconscious -- revealing Young Keiko standing behind<br>
    him with the hypospray in hand. She looks pleased,<br>
    then heads down the corridor.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>87B INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Transporter platform is now filled with SEVERAL<br>
    FERENGI (including Berik), who are very unhappy at<br>
    their captivity. One of them BOUNCES off the<br>
    FORCEFIELD.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>88 INT. SCHOOL ROOM</p>
  <p> Young Picard is at the terminal. He looks satisfied.<br>
    After a beat... picks up a phaser and heads for the<br>
    door. Alexander is standing on guard in the open<br>
    doorway, looking up and down the Corridor with a phaser<br>
    in her hand.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    That's all of them except for the<br>
    two on the Bridge. Wait here<br>
    until I return.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>89 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker is still droning on to Morta, who is hopelessly<br>
    lost at this point.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 61A.</p>
  <p>89 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    ... so one more time. The<br>
    ramistat kiloquad capacity is a<br>
    function of the square root of<br>
    the intermix ratio times the sum<br>
    of the plasma injector quotient.</p>
  <p> Suddenly the Turbolift doors OPEN and Young Picard<br>
    ENTERS carrying a phaser. Morta turns around to see<br>
    who it is, but that's when Riker HITS him with a<br>
    straight elbow and Morta crumbles to the floor. Riker<br>
    indicates the Ready Room to Young Picard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    There's one more.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/09/92 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>90 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Lurin is sitting at the desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> LURIN<br>
    (demanding)<br>
    Come in. What do you want?</p>
  <p> Young Picard ENTERS, phaser in hand.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    I believe you're in my chair.</p>
  <p> Off Lurin's stunned reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>91 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise in orbit around Ligos Seven.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate: 46236.3<br>
    We have taken Lurin and his men<br>
    into custody. The Ferengi<br>
    Alliance has quickly disavowed<br>
    any knowledge of these renegades.</p>
  <p>92 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly and O'Brien are at the console, while Young<br>
    Picard, Young Guinan and Young Keiko watch.</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    With the mining operation<br>
    closed and our crew back on<br>
    board, we can now turn our<br>
    attention to other problems.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Phase inducers activated...<br>
    energy levels nominal...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm loading the adult patterns<br>
    into the buffer...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Transposition matrix locked<br>
    in...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/09/92 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>92 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Young Picard nods and then steps up onto the platform.<br>
    A moment, then Young Picard gives the order...</p>
  <p> YOUNG PICARD<br>
    Energize...</p>
  <p> O'Brien works the console and Young Picard<br>
    DEMATERIALIZES.</p>
  <p> A moment of tension for Beverly and O'Brien as he<br>
    REMATERIALIZES... it's the ADULT Picard. Beverly pulls<br>
    out her tricorder and gives him a quick scan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How do you feel, Captain?</p>
  <p> He looks around the room for a few seconds. He reaches<br>
    up and runs a hand over his head where hair was only<br>
    a moment ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I feel fine. Everything just<br>
    seems... smaller.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>93 INT. SCHOOL ROOM</p>
  <p> Young Ro sits at a child-sized desk, drawing with<br>
    crayons. A sad, lonely portrait.</p>
  <p> ADULT Guinan ENTERS, sitting at the desk next to Young<br>
    Ro's. As she leans over to see Young Ro's drawing.<br>
    It's a simple, elegant drawing of a woman's face.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    It's my mother.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The funny thing is... I never<br>
    really drew a picture of her when<br>
    I was young... but for some reason<br>
    I wanted to now.</p>
  <p> Guinan looks down and sees several other crayon<br>
    drawings... ships, people, planets, etc.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    That's the wonderful thing about<br>
    crayons... when you're a child,<br>
    they can take you to more places<br>
    than a starship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rascals&quot; - REV. 9/09/92 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>93 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Young Ro nods thoughtfully.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    It's my turn, isn't it?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Only if you're ready.</p>
  <p> Young Ro looks around the room for a moment.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    It's not quite as bad as I<br>
    remembered it... being a child,<br>
    I mean.</p>
  <p> A long beat. And there is a definite trace of sadness<br>
    in Young Ro's voice.</p>
  <p> YOUNG RO<br>
    We better get going.</p>
  <p> She begins to stand up, but Guinan stops her.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (warmly)<br>
    There's no hurry. The Transporter<br>
    will still be there... pass me<br>
    the burnt umber.</p>
  <p> A moment as Young Ro looks up into Guinan's face...<br>
    then Young Ro smiles in heartfelt gratitude and they<br>
    begin to pick up the crayons...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
