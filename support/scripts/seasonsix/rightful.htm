  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship at warp.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA is in command, with N.D. CREWMEMBERS at all other<br>
    positions. RIKER and SEVERAL CREWMEMBERS ENTER from<br>
    the fore and aft Turbolifts. It's time to change<br>
    shifts and while Riker moves to Data, the other members<br>
    of Riker's shift take over their positions from the<br>
    people on Data's shift. No one moves to relieve the<br>
    N.D. Ensign standing at Tactical.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good morning, Commander.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data. Interesting night?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I found it extremely interesting.<br>
    The lateral sensor array performed<br>
    three separate spectral analyses<br>
    of the Alwanir Nebula on three<br>
    distinct frequencies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry I missed it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (missing the ironic<br>
    tone)<br>
    I will have the reports sent to<br>
    you.<br>
    (begins making report)<br>
    We are still on course for the<br>
    Gariman system, our speed is warp<br>
    six and our ETA is thirteen<br>
    hundred hours. Sickbay reported<br>
    one minor injury in the exobiology<br>
    department at zero four<br>
    twenty hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker glances up at Tactical and frowns. The Ensign is<br>
    still standing there, waiting awkwardly.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Isn't Worf supposed to relieve<br>
    Ensign Torigan?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I was not informed of<br>
    any change in the duty roster.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    He's never late.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Riker to Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> Silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Computer, locate Lieutenant Worf.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Lieutenant Worf is in his<br>
    quarters.</p>
  <p> Data and Riker exchange looks.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Something's wrong. Data, you have<br>
    the Bridge.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Security, meet me on deck seven,<br>
    section twenty-five baker.</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Riker and TWO N.D. SECURITY CREWMEMBERS move down the<br>
    Corridor and come to a stop outside Worf's Quarters.<br>
    The Security Officers take up positions on either side<br>
    of Riker as he reaches for the door panel. He presses<br>
    it... no response.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Computer, override the security<br>
    lock on this door. Authorization:<br>
    Riker alpha six zero.</p>
  <p> The doors open to reveal a DARK and MURKY room filled<br>
    with DENSE SMOKE. They cautiously EXIT to:</p>
  <p>4 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> As Riker and the two officers ENTER the room. The room<br>
    is filled with acrid smoke and is lit only with dimly<br>
    seen ceremonial candles. They look about for a moment,<br>
    trying to peer through the gloom. Suddenly, they are<br>
    startled by a throaty ROAR out of the darkness.</p>
  <p> WORF'S VOICE<br>
    TORVA LUK DO SHELL!</p>
  <p>5 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing WORF sitting cross-legged on the deck in his<br>
    bedroom. He is wearing some kind of Klingon ceremonial<br>
    robe and he is staring into a small FIRE which is<br>
    blazing in a stone firepit that is sitting in the<br>
    center of the bedroom. The look on his face is feral,<br>
    intense... Klingon. This, combined with the red light<br>
    of the fire, the smoke, and the dark shadows make this<br>
    an almost satanic, other-worldly scene.</p>
  <p> There is a beat, and then Worf lifts his eyes from the<br>
    fire and sees Riker... his mouth twists into a snarl.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Worf?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What the hell are you doing?</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly comes back to the here and now and the<br>
    snarl on his face gives way to sudden realization...<br>
    and surprise. Off their reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship drops out of warp.</p>
  <p>7 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Riker and PICARD are sitting at the desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He had no explanation at all?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not a word. He just got dressed<br>
    and then reported for duty as if<br>
    nothing had happened.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Captain, this isn't the first...<br>
    problem I've had with Worf lately.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Until now, it wasn't anything<br>
    serious so I didn't bring it to<br>
    your attention. But, to be blunt,<br>
    he's been getting... sloppy. His<br>
    duty reports have been incomplete,<br>
    he's fallen behind in maintenance<br>
    checks, he just seems...<br>
    distracted.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where's Worf now?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I confined him to quarters.</p>
  <p> Picard thinks for a another beat, then stands and heads<br>
    for the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the Bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> They both EXIT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>8 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The smoke is gone, the normal lights are on, and the<br>
    fire has been put out. Worf is lying on his bed,<br>
    staring up at the ceiling. The door CHIMES. He hears<br>
    it, but he seems listless, almost apathetic. The door<br>
    CHIMES a second time.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p>9 ANGLE ON DOOR</p>
  <p> As Picard ENTERS. He looks around the room... the<br>
    ritual candles, lava rocks, and remnants of the fire<br>
    pit are all still in evidence. The room is a mess,<br>
    with Klingon implements and clothes lying all over the<br>
    place. Picard carefully picks his way through the<br>
    detritus and moves toward the bedroom.</p>
  <p> When Worf sees that it's Picard, he moves to a sitting<br>
    position on the bed.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard notes the untidy room and Worf's indifferent<br>
    attitude. He decides to give him a wake-up call.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (hard)<br>
    On your feet, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> Worf's head snaps up at the tone in Picard's voice and<br>
    he stands stiffly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Mister Worf, your personal affairs<br>
    are strictly your concern unless<br>
    they interfere with the operation<br>
    of this ship. You've crossed that<br>
    line. Now as your Captain, I want<br>
    to know exactly what's going on.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him for a moment... and then responds<br>
    both to the sound of command and the note of compassion<br>
    in Picard's voice.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is... difficult to explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Try.</p>
  <p> Worf nods after a beat and seems to accept the need to<br>
    get this out into the open. He moves about the room,<br>
    wrestling with some inner turmoil.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ever since I returned from the<br>
    Carraya system I have felt...<br>
    empty...</p>
  <p> Picard reacts to the mention of the Carraya system. He<br>
    remembers Worf's reluctance to talk about this and he<br>
    is careful not to push him too far.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does this have something to do<br>
    with the Klingons you... rescued<br>
    from Carraya Four?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They were young... they knew<br>
    nothing of their heritage. So<br>
    while I was there, I tried to...<br>
    teach them... teach them about<br>
    their people, their culture.</p>
  <p> A passion and fire comes into Worf's eyes and in his<br>
    movements that was missing only a moment ago as he<br>
    remembers his experiences.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I told them our ancient stories...<br>
    instructed them in our customs...<br>
    explained our beliefs. And then<br>
    I told them about Kahless... how<br>
    he united our people long ago...<br>
    how he gave us honor and<br>
    strength... and how he promised to<br>
    return one day and lead us again.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It took time... but I saw them<br>
    begin to discover the warriors<br>
    within themselves... to believe in<br>
    Kahless and his teachings... and<br>
    to become truly Klingon. It was<br>
    ... unlike anything I had<br>
    experienced before.</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at the rocks and debris scattered<br>
    around the room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that what you were doing here?<br>
    Trying to recapture those<br>
    feelings?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I was trying to summon a vision of<br>
    Kahless.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    You might have tried using the<br>
    Holodeck instead of setting your<br>
    quarters on fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Using the Holodeck would not be<br>
    appropriate... everything had to<br>
    be real if Kahless were to appear.<br>
    (defeated)<br>
    But all this was for nothing... he<br>
    did not come to me.</p>
  <p> He moves to a small Klingon statue sitting prominently<br>
    on a shelf and looks at it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I gave Toq and the others a belief<br>
    in Sto-Vo-Kor: the life which<br>
    lies beyond this life... where<br>
    Kahless awaits us.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I saw the power of their<br>
    belief... I began to question the<br>
    strength of my own. And I found<br>
    it... wanting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you lost your... faith in Sto-Vo-Kor?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    To lose something, one must first<br>
    possess it... I am not sure I ever<br>
    had a true belief.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Picard... feels guilty about the way he's<br>
    been acting.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But I should not have allowed it<br>
    to interfere with my duties. My<br>
    behavior has been --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Inexcusable.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But understandable. You are the<br>
    only Klingon in Starfleet... and<br>
    one of the few raised by human<br>
    parents. Perhaps the problem is<br>
    that you have only studied the<br>
    beliefs of your people... only<br>
    looked at them from the outside.</p>
  <p> Picard moves around the room for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It may be that what you seek<br>
    cannot be found on the Enterprise.<br>
    You may need to immerse yourself<br>
    in Klingon beliefs before you can<br>
    discover whether they hold any<br>
    truths for you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Is there anything you could do...<br>
    any place you could go... to<br>
    explore your faith more fully?</p>
  <p> Worf thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Boreth. The Followers of Kahless<br>
    wait there for his return. To<br>
    Klingons, there is no more sacred<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> Picard considers him for a long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Boreth is twelve days from here by<br>
    shuttle. As of this moment, you<br>
    are on leave.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope you find what you're<br>
    looking for, Mister Worf.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Because the next time you set foot<br>
    on this ship I expect you to carry<br>
    out your duties like a Starfleet<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS. Worf moves back to the statue. Off his<br>
    look...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>10 EXT. BORETH (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The planet surface is mountainous... desolate... no<br>
    cities or dwellings of any kind except for a single<br>
    temple situated high up on the tallest mountaintop.</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE ON WORF</p>
  <p> His eyes are closed and he is sweating heavily.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (low, intense)<br>
    Torva... Luk...</p>
  <p> VOICES (O.C.)<br>
    ... Do Shell...</p>
  <p> We MOVE to REVEAL that we are in:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/11/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 INT. LAVA CAVE</p>
  <p> Worf is sitting cross-legged on the floor of the cave<br>
    along with SEVERAL N.D. KLINGONS including one named<br>
    TORIN. All are dressed in ceremonial robes and are<br>
    sitting around a smoking fire pit with their eyes<br>
    closed. There are candles and Klingon artifacts in<br>
    evidence with smoke drifting throughout the cave. The<br>
    heat is intense and the scene should look like an<br>
    expanded and more traditional version of the scene in<br>
    Worf's Quarters in the Teaser. They've all been here<br>
    for several hours.</p>
  <p> They all open their eyes and stare into the flames.<br>
    One Klingon takes a small pail and pours some water on<br>
    the flames, which then crackle and sizzle, sending out<br>
    even more smoke. Suddenly, one young Klingon -- DIVOK --<br>
    looks up and reacts to something.</p>
  <p> DIVOK<br>
    Kahless! I see Kahless!</p>
  <p> The others all look at him with pleasure except Worf,<br>
    who is disappointed that he is not the one receiving<br>
    the vision. Another Klingon, this one much older --<br>
    KOROTH -- the Head Cleric in charge of this place, nods<br>
    in satisfaction. He is an older man, his hair mostly<br>
    gray at this point, he is lean and trim -- a man whose<br>
    life is uncluttered by indulgence of any kind. He<br>
    wears a ceremonial garment that is part priestly<br>
    vestment, part battle armor.</p>
  <p> Divok continues to watch something which only he can<br>
    see. His face is drenched with sweat and he seems on<br>
    the verge of total exhaustion.</p>
  <p> DIVOK<br>
    He is standing before me...<br>
    holding a sword... he wants<br>
    something... me, he wants me! He<br>
    wants me to go with him!</p>
  <p> Divok gets to his feet and starts to move toward the<br>
    unseen vision. Worf and the others have to catch him<br>
    before he falls into the fire. Divok practically<br>
    collapses into Worf's arms, his energy totally spent.</p>

  <p> KOROTH<br>
    It is a powerful vision you have<br>
    had, Divok. Kahless has asked you<br>
    to join him in Sto-Vo-Kor. You<br>
    are only nineteen and yet your<br>
    place among the honored dead is<br>
    already secure</p>
  <p> Koroth motions to the others.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Take him back to his chamber. Let<br>
    him sleep.</p>
  <p> Divok lets the others help him up some crude steps and<br>
    out of the cave. Everyone EXITS except Worf. He<br>
    remains standing near the fire pit, with defeat written<br>
    on his face. After a beat, Worf dowses the fire with<br>
    water and it goes OUT.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>13 INT. WORF'S CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> A small, spartan room with a single hard bed, a bench<br>
    and a crude chest. The building and furnishings are<br>
    obviously quite old. It should look like a monk's room<br>
    at a monastery. Worf is taking some personal items<br>
    from the chest and packing them in his haversack. He<br>
    is facing away from the open doorway when Koroth<br>
    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    You are leaving us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (without turning around)<br>
    It has been ten days, Koroth. But<br>
    I have had no visions... I have<br>
    received no insight.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    There is nothing for me here.</p>
  <p> Koroth takes a few steps in the small room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    What is the story of The Promise,<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf says nothing for a beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    When Kahless united the people and<br>
    gave them the laws of honor, he<br>
    saw that his work was done. So<br>
    one night he gathered his<br>
    belongings and went to the edge of<br>
    the city to say good-bye.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    (picking up the thread<br>
    of the story)<br>
    The people wept... they did not<br>
    want him to go.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And Kahless said, &quot;You are<br>
    Klingons. You need no one but<br>
    yourselves. I will go now... to<br>
    Sto-Vo-Kor. But I promise one day<br>
    I will return.&quot; Then Kahless<br>
    pointed to a star in the sky and<br>
    said, &quot;Look for me there... on<br>
    that point of light.&quot;</p>
  <p> Koroth opens his arms and indicates the entire room.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    So here we are... on a world<br>
    circling that distant point of<br>
    light. It has been over fifteen<br>
    centuries since he made that<br>
    promise... and still we wait.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What are ten days in the life of<br>
    one Klingon compared to that? Is<br>
    the son of Mogh really so easily<br>
    discouraged?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Koroth turns away from Worf and moves a few steps away.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    You came to us seeking answers...<br>
    but this is a place of questions.<br>
    Open your heart to Kahless... ask<br>
    him your questions... let him<br>
    speak to you with your mind<br>
    unclouded by doubt or hesitation.<br>
    Only then can you find what you<br>
    are looking for.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you cannot do that... then<br>
    perhaps you should return to your<br>
    starship.</p>
  <p> Koroth EXITS. Worf takes a beat to consider the star<br>
    in the wall. Off his expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>14 INT. TEMPLE</p>
  <p> The Temple is more like a war room than a church.<br>
    There are weapons on display everywhere, proud banners<br>
    and emblems adorn the walls and the room is dominated<br>
    at one end by a single ornate chair sitting on a raised<br>
    platform. There is a bat'leth sword on the chair.<br>
    There are a few spartan benches in the room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS from a doorway and walks through the<br>
    temple. No other Klingons are in sight and the Temple<br>
    is completely still... only the low sound of the wind<br>
    outside can be heard. He approaches a LARGE PAINTING<br>
    on the wall.</p>
  <p>15 ON PAINTING</p>
  <p> It is a heroic rendering of Kahless standing alone. He<br>
    is dressed in a distinctive garment that is very<br>
    different from the normal Klingon battledress. His<br>
    features are clearly visible in the painting and he<br>
    seems to beckoning someone to follow him. (Kahless<br>
    lived centuries ago and so there should be no<br>
    suggestion of anything remotely modern in the<br>
    painting.)</p>
  <p>16 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Worf studies the painting for a moment.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (softly)<br>
    I will open my heart, Kahless.<br>

    I will...</p>

  <p>18 INT. LAVA CAVES - SEVERAL HOURS LATER</p>
  <p> Worf is sweating heavily as he concentrates... the<br>
    smoke is thick in the air... Divok is sitting nearby<br>
    watching and tending the fire.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Torva... Luk... Do... Shell...</p>
  <p> Worf opens his eyes and looks into the flames.</p>
  <p>19 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> There is a long beat and then suddenly there is a SWIRL<br>
    of SMOKE AND LIGHT on the opposite side of the fire<br>
    from Worf. A FIGURE begins to COALESCE in the cave.<br>
    Suddenly KAHLESS is standing before Worf in the cave.<br>
    He is dressed in the same garments as seen in the<br>
    painting. Worf's expression is one of awe and elation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I see Kahless.</p>
  <p>20 DIVOK</p>
  <p> Reacts to the sight with shock... how can he see Worf's<br>
    vision?</p>
  <p>21 WIDER</p>
  <p> As Kahless blinks for a second. Worf does not see<br>
    Divok RUN OUT of the cave in terror. Worf stands up,<br>
    unaware that anything is wrong. Kahless looks around<br>
    for a moment... then steps forward.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Kahless moves toward him and reaches out his hand.<br>
    Worf hesitates, unsure what to do... and then he<br>
    reaches out tentatively. They clasp hands just as<br>
    Divok and SEVERAL OTHER KLINGONS -- including Torin --<br>
    coming running INTO the cave. They stop in shock at<br>
    the sight of Kahless.</p>
  <p> Kahless looks up at them and Worf turns as well... he<br>
    suddenly realizes that everyone can see Kahless! He<br>
    turns back to him in shock.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are... real?</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (in a strong, clear<br>
    voice)<br>
    I am Kahless... and I have<br>
    returned.</p>
  <p> Off Worf's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>22 EXT. BORETH (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As seen before.</p>
  <p>23 INT. TEMPLE</p>
  <p> Kahless ENTERS from the Lava Caves. The crowd of<br>
    Klingons seen at the end of Act One are all following<br>
    him in silent amazement. Worf is bringing up the rear<br>
    of the crowd, stunned and shocked... unsure what to<br>
    think or believe.</p>
  <p> Kahless strides into the center of the room and looks<br>
    around for a beat. His gaze falls on the empty chair<br>
    with the bat'leth sword. He smiles and moves toward<br>
    it. He is about to pick it up when Koroth's voice<br>
    booms out.</p>
  <p> KOROTH'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c)<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p>24 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing Koroth standing at the rear of the room,<br>
    outrage clear on his face. The other Klingons exchange<br>
    nervous glances among themselves and then part to let<br>
    Koroth walk to the front of the room. Kahless faces<br>
    Koroth calmly, confidently.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Who are you?</p>
  <p> Divok calls out to Koroth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DIVOK<br>
    It is Kahless!</p>
  <p> Koroth glances toward the large painting seen earlier<br>
    and then back to Kahless... the resemblance is uncanny.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    I have returned.</p>
  <p> Kahless' gaze is intense, powerful... there is a<br>
    magnetism and strength to this man that even Koroth can<br>
    feel, but Koroth's eyes still narrow in suspicion.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    You doubt me.</p>
  <p> Kahless turns and looks at the gathered Klingons<br>
    watching him with rapt attention in the Temple...<br>
    waiting to see what he will do or say. His voice now<br>
    rings out in the silence... strong and sure.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (re: sword)<br>
    Who here knows the story of how<br>
    this sword was forged?</p>
  <p> People look at each other in puzzlement. Torin finally<br>
    answers.</p>
  <p> TORIN<br>
    No one knows. It is not written<br>
    in the sacred texts.</p>
  <p> Kahless looks at Koroth, who is watching him carefully,<br>
    then turns back to the crowd.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    I went into the mountains... all<br>
    the way to the Kri'stak Volcano.<br>
    I cut off a lock of my hair and<br>
    thrust it into the river of molten<br>
    rock which poured from the summit.<br>
    The hair began to burn, but then<br>
    I plunged it into the lake of<br>
    Lusor and twisted it into a sword.<br>
    (turns to Koroth)<br>
    And after I used it to kill the<br>
    tyrant Molor I gave it a name:<br>
    bat'leth, the sword of honor.</p>
  <p> The reaction on Koroth is profound. His eyes widen and<br>
    he takes a step back, shocked by what he has heard.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    You know...<br>
    (turns to others)<br>
    The story of the sword is known<br>
    only to the High Clerics... it was<br>
    never written down, so that if he<br>
    returned, we could be sure it was<br>
    Kahless.</p>
  <p> Satisfied with Koroth's acceptance, Kahless turns to<br>
    the expectant crowd.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    I have returned because there is<br>
    a great need in my people... they<br>
    fight among themselves in petty<br>
    wars and corrupt the glory of the<br>
    Klingon spirit. They have lost<br>
    their way. But it is not too<br>
    late. I have returned and I will<br>
    lead my people again!</p>
  <p> Koroth stands before Kahless and then very deliberately<br>
    goes down on one knee.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Vorcha-doh-baghk, Kahless! (All<br>
    hail Kahless)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Then following his lead, everyone in the room drops to<br>
    one knee... swept away by the emotion of the moment.<br>
    Only Worf remains standing in the doorway to the<br>
    caves... unsure what to do.</p>
  <p> CROWD<br>
    Vorcha-doh-baghk, Kahless!</p>
  <p> Kahless looks out over the crowd with confidence. He<br>
    sees Worf standing alone in the back of the room...<br>
    their eyes meet for a moment, then Worf looks away,<br>
    confused and uncertain.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>25 INT. WORF'S CHAMBERS</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS and goes directly to his haversack and<br>
    begins looking for something. He pulls out a tricorder<br>
    just as Kahless ENTERS behind him.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What is it you are doing?</p>
  <p> Worf turns quickly, hiding the tricorder momentarily.<br>
    After a beat, he pulls it out and shows it to Kahless.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was getting my tricorder.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Tri-Corder? Is it a weapon?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. It is a tool. I was going to<br>
    use it to see if you were...</p>
  <p> Worf trails off.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    To see if I were real. Proceed.<br>
    Use your Tri-Corder.</p>
  <p> Worf scans Kahless with the tricorder. He reacts with<br>
    surprise to what he sees.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Well?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are... Klingon.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What else could I be?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There are many possibilities... a<br>
    shape shifter, a holographic<br>
    projection...</p>
  <p> Kahless laughs gently.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    ... So, you are a skeptic, Worf.<br>
    I like that....</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How do you know my name?</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    We have met before. I appeared to<br>
    you in a vision... in the caves of<br>
    No'Mat... you were a child then...<br>
    and I told you...<br>
    (trying to remember)<br>
    ... that you would do something...<br>
    no Klingon had ever done<br>
    before....</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Was I ... correct?...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I... am the first Klingon to serve<br>
    in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    &quot;Star-Fleet&quot;... there are still<br>
    many things you will have to<br>
    explain to me.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him with a mixture of puzzlement and awe.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You have a question.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you appear when I was in<br>
    the cave? Why not appear to<br>
    Koroth, or Torin?</p>
  <p> Kahless smiles and puts a hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 21A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Perhaps it is because you have the<br>
    heart of a true warrior.<br>
    (beat, studies him for<br>
    a moment)<br>
    You still do not believe it is me,<br>
    do you Worf?...</p>
  <p> Worf takes a long moment... puts aside the tricorder<br>
    and then meets his gaze again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I... want to believe.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That is a ... beginning... .</p>
  <p> Kahless gestures out the door and after a beat Worf<br>
    moves toward the door. They EXIT together.</p>

    Our mission to Endora Seven has<br>

  <p>27 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, and TROI are sitting at the table.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kahless? Hasn't he been dead for<br>
    over a thousand years?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One thousand five hundred and<br>
    forty-seven years to be exact.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Do the Klingons actually believe<br>
    that this is the real Kahless?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would seem that at least Gowron<br>
    believes it. He personally<br>
    contacted the Federation Council<br>
    and asked that a starship be sent<br>
    to bring Kahless back to the Home<br>
    World.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>27 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why wouldn't he send a Klingon<br>
    ship?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gowron would only say that there<br>
    were certain... security concerns<br>
    which prompted him to make this<br>
    request. As the nearest starship<br>
    to Boreth, the task is ours.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Have we heard from Worf?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. All communication with Boreth<br>
    has been cut-off since yesterday.</p>
  <p> That sounds ominous and they all exchange looks.<br>
    Picard takes a beat, then gets up and heads for the<br>
    door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Set course for Boreth, Number One.<br>
    Warp six.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> They all EXIT.</p>

  <p>28 EXT. BORETH (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As seen before.</p>
  <p>29 INT. TEMPLE</p>
  <p> The temple is swarming with Klingons... a massive<br>
    celebration is underway complete with ample food and<br>
    bombastic Klingon opera filling the air. Tables and<br>
    benches have been brought in to fill the area. A large<br>
    stone cistern is filled with liquid of some type and<br>
    various Klingons plunge goblets into it and then drink<br>
    heartily. The room is festive, almost giddy with<br>
    celebration as Klingons slap each other around in macho<br>
    goodfellowship.</p>
  <p> Kahless is sitting on the raised chair seen earlier.<br>
    Koroth and Torin are both sitting near him, while Worf<br>
    occupies a bench nearby.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf is watching the proceedings with a reserved<br>
    expression on his face... not joining in the<br>
    celebration. Kahless is listening to Torin.</p>
  <p> TORIN<br>
    (cautioning)<br>
    Gowron is the Leader of the<br>
    Council... he commands the entire<br>
    Defense Force... if he chooses to<br>
    oppose you...</p>
  <p> This doesn't faze Kahless in the least.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (to Koroth &amp; Torin)<br>
    Do not worry. We stand on the<br>
    threshold of a new era for our<br>
    people... Klingons from all over<br>
    the Empire... will flock to my<br>
    banner...<br>

  <p> Worf looks up and sees Kahless looking directly at him.<br>
    A few heads turn and Worf is a little uncomfortable at<br>
    this very public dialog, but he doesn't flinch from<br>
    answering honestly.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Are you contemplating yet another<br>
    question for me?<br>
    (ironic smile)<br>
    After three days, I am beginning<br>
    to wonder if you know how to do<br>
    anything else.</p>
  <p> This elicits a few feeble chuckles, but there is a<br>
    definite edge beginning to creep into Kahless' voice<br>
    and more and more heads are starting to turn toward<br>
    this conversation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Questions are the beginning of<br>
    wisdom... it is the mark of a true<br>
    warrior.</p>
  <p> The smile on Kahless' face loses some of its mirth.<br>
    The room gets a little quieter.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    But do not forget that a leader<br>
    need not answer questions from<br>
    those he leads... it is enough<br>
    that he says to do a thing... and<br>
    they will do it. If he says to<br>
    run, they run... if he says to<br>
    fight, they fight... if he says<br>
    to die...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    ... they die.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. If the... commander is<br>
    worthy of their trust.</p>
  <p> The Temple is now dead silent... everyone is watching<br>
    the exchange with mounting tension. The air crackles<br>
    between the two men.</p>

  <p> Kahless quickly stands, a feral look on his face.<br>
    Without breaking eye contact with Worf, he moves into<br>
    a clear space in the room. Kahless picks up his<br>

  <p> Worf and Kahless swing their swords at each other and<br>
    begin to fight.</p>
  <p> The fight is fast-paced... intense... each man looking<br>
    for an opening, but finding none...</p>
  <p> The fight builds... the ferocity of the crowd grows<br>
    with every blow... suddenly their swords lock together.<br>
    Kahless pulls Worf backward and they both go flying<br>
    into a nearby table.</p>
  <p> Both men scramble to their feet and face each other...<br>
    there is a tense beat and suddenly Kahless ROARS with<br>
    laughter. Worf and the crowd fall silent, unsure how<br>
    to respond. Kahless' laugh fills the room for a<br>
    moment... then he looks around at the astonished faces<br>
    of the gathered Klingons.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What is wrong? Is there only<br>
    anger and bloodlust in your souls?<br>
    Is that all that is left in the<br>

    followed by Koroth, Torin and Worf.</p>
  <p> Kahless looks around the bay for a beat... his attitude<br>
    is curious about his surroundings, but not shocked by<br>
    them. He's never been on a spaceship, but Kahless has<br>
    that regal bearing that refuses to be over-awed by<br>
    anything. Picard and Riker step forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> Kahless looks to Worf.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>

    This is the... &quot;human&quot; you told me<br>
    about?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Kahless turns back to Picard and claps him on the<br>

  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    You must be a mighty warrior to<br>
    command such respect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (recovering quickly)<br>
    Thank you.</p>

    They have... different ways.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>

    Ah. Then she is not a gift.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Koroth moves to Kahless' side.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    It is as I said... we should be on<br>
    a Klingon warship. This is not<br>
    the place for us.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Their customs may be different,<br>
    but Worf tells me they are not<br>
    dishonorable... and I am eager to<br>
    see the weapons on this &quot;Star-Ship.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard moves in smoothly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would be happy to arrange a tour<br>
    of the entire ship for you, once<br>
    you've settled in. Perhaps<br>
    Commander Riker could begin by<br>
    showing you your quarters.</p>

    Did you take any other tricorder<br>

    scan or an anatomical profile?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Then it's going to be hard to<br>
    eliminate any possibility at this<br>
    point. He could be a coalescent<br>
    being taking Klingon form... a bioreplicant...<br>
    or even a Klingon<br>
    surgically altered to resemble<br>
    Kahless...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I felt no deception or malice from<br>
    him... just an over-whelming sense<br>
    of confidence... almost arrogance.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Worf, what are his plans when he<br>
    returns to the Home World?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He wants to restore the glory of<br>
    the Empire by purging it of<br>
    dishonor and corruption.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't think Gowron's going to<br>
    like the sound of that.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That might have something to do<br>
    with why he wanted a Federation<br>
    ship to bring Kahless. Gowron may<br>
    not want to be seen embracing<br>
    this... Messiah before he knows<br>
    what Kahless wants.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps this Kahless is a...<br>
    stalking horse for someone else...<br>
    someone who intends to seize<br>
    control from Gowron.</p>

    No offense, Worf... but I have<br>
    trouble believing that the man I<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not saying that he is... I<br>
    merely think we should not<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    It was given to me during my Rite<br>

  <p> Kahless takes the knife... feels the heft of the<br>
    weapon.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>

    Did you observe the Rite here...<br>
    among these aliens?...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... I returned to the Home World<br>
    for the ceremony. But these...<br>
    aliens have allowed me to conduct<br>
    other Klingon rituals on the<br>

    A good knife... well forged. But<br>
    even the best blade will rust and<br>
    grow dull unless it is cared<br>

  <p>48 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Revealing that Kahless has just ENTERED from the<br>
    bedroom. He smiles warmly and clasps Worf on the<br>
    shoulder in goodfellowship.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Where are you going?</p>
  <p> Worf glances at Koroth and Torin.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Kahless, it might be better if --</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    Go away, Koroth. I've listened to<br>
    you and Torin until my ears burn<br>
    with politics. Let me and Worf be<br>
    alone for a while.</p>
  <p> Koroth wants to object, but Kahless' wishes are pretty<br>
    apparent. Koroth and Torin exchange uneasy glances,<br>
    then bow to the inevitable.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    As you wish.</p>
  <p> Koroth and Torin EXIT. Kahless moves to a pitcher<br>
    sitting on a table and pours a drink for himself and<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    They are good men. But they<br>
    chatter like tree hens.</p>
  <p> Kahless laughs and Worf laughs with him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/10/93 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He hands the goblet to Worf and they each take a<br>
    swallow. Worf screws up his face in distaste.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am sorry our replicators do not<br>
    do justice to Klingon Warnog...</p>
  <p> Kahless takes another taste... then shakes his head.<br>
    He can't taste the difference.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    It has been so long since I have<br>
    tasted any food or drink... there<br>
    are many things I have forgotten.</p>
  <p> Worf is a little disturbed by this... some flaws are<br>
    showing up in his hero. There is a quiet beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless, may I ask you about...<br>
    death... and Sto-Vo-Kor? Tell me<br>
    what awaits us beyond this life.</p>
  <p> Kahless moves to the window and looks out into space.<br>
    He says nothing for a long moment. Worf waits with<br>
    anticipation... hoping that the secrets of life and<br>
    death are about to be unveiled to him. Finally Kahless<br>
    turns back to him.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    I do not have those answers.</p>
  <p> Worf's disappointment and confusion is obvious.<br>
    Kahless moves to him... for some reason he seems eager<br>
    to explain.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    I am merely a... traveller...<br>
    someone who has journeyed back and<br>
    forth between this world and the<br>
    next.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    While I am in this form, I know<br>
    only about this world...</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    And there is much work for me to<br>
    do in this world... and you will<br>
    be part of it, Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Me?</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    It was your purity of heart that<br>
    summoned me back from Sto-Vo-Kor...<br>
    and Koroth has told me<br>
    about the respect you have earned<br>
    in the Federation and the Empire.<br>
    I want you to have a place at my<br>
    side as we restore honor to our<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> Worf is overwhelmed by this thought... Kahless moves<br>
    back to the window and looks out into space. He's much<br>
    more confident now.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Let me tell you about the new<br>
    Empire we will forge...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>49 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Worf is standing at the window looking out into space<br>
    in the same position that we just left Kahless. Gowron<br>
    is sitting at the table. Worf's expression is eager<br>
    and optimistic.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    ... it will be glorious.</p>
  <p> Worf smiles and looks out into space for a beat.<br>
    Gowron is not swayed by anything Worf has told him...<br>
    he scowls at Worf in bitterness.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    It will be war.</p>
  <p> Worf turns back to him in irritation, but Gowron will<br>
    have no more of this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FOUR 46.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    You are not a fool, Worf. Do you<br>
    really think that every Klingon in<br>
    the Empire will bend his knee and<br>
    grovel before this man just<br>
    because Koroth says he is Kahless?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is Kahless. Your own test<br>
    proved it.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I will not hand over the Empire to<br>
    Koroth because of one test.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is not Koroth, it is --</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Of course it is Koroth. Open your<br>
    eyes... Koroth and the other<br>
    &quot;Guardians&quot; have always opposed<br>
    me. This is nothing more than a<br>
    ploy for them to finally seize<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> Gowron takes a beat... moves to the windows and looks<br>
    outside for a moment.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Even now, there are warriors on my<br>
    own ship who want to see<br>
    Kahless... there are others who<br>
    believe he is an imposter... the<br>
    divisions are already forming...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It does not have to be that way...<br>
    we could all join together and<br>
    welcome Kahless as a united<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Don't you see? This is exactly<br>
    why they want you to join them...<br>
    because your brother sits on the<br>
    Council and your voice carries<br>
    weight in the Empire. They want<br>
    you to influence others to follow<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Gowron considers him for a moment... tries a different<br>
    approach.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Worf, we fought together once...<br>
    side by side to keep the Empire<br>
    from being torn apart... will you<br>
    stand by and let these impostors<br>
    destroy all that we fought so hard<br>
    to protect?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Renounce him, Worf. Stand with me<br>
    and we can hold the Empire<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him for a moment... then shakes his head<br>
    sadly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You do not understand. Kahless is<br>
    our future... only with his help<br>
    can we revive the pure warriors<br>
    within ourselves.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Listen to him, Gowron... open your<br>
    heart and hear his words as I<br>
    have. He will restore your<br>
    faith... as he has restored mine.<br>
    Give him a chance to lift your<br>
    spirit and cleanse your heart<br>
    before you take up arms.</p>
  <p> Gowron appears to be considering Worf's words. Off<br>
    Worf's confident expression...</p>

  <p> The two ships hang in space together.</p>
  <p>51 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Worf and Koroth are walking toward the Holodeck.<br>
    Koroth is disturbed.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    You should not have arranged this<br>
    without my approval.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/11/93 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They stop outside the Holodeck doors.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I did. Kahless approved.</p>
  <p> A long beat before Koroth answers in a low, tight<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Yes. Yes, of course he did.</p>
  <p> Worf touches the computer panel and they both EXIT to<br>
    the Holodeck.</p>
  <p>52 INT. HOLODECK/TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The Holodeck has recreated the same Temple as seen<br>
    earlier. Koroth and Worf ENTER and find Data and Torin<br>
    waiting for them. Koroth moves to speak privately with<br>
    Torin, while Data approaches Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant, would my presence here<br>
    be inappropriate? I would greatly<br>
    appreciate the opportunity to<br>
    study Klingon beliefs in this<br>
    forum, but I do not wish to give<br>
    offense.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless welcomes all who come to<br>
    hear his words. Your presence<br>
    will not give offense.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> They both turn at the SOUND of the Holodeck doors<br>
    OPENING.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>53 INCLUDE DOORWAY</p>
  <p> Just as Gowron (wearing his cloak), and SEVERAL N.D.<br>
    KLINGONS ENTER from the Corridor. They are escorted by<br>
    THREE N.D. ENTERPRISE SECURITY GUARDS. Gowron and<br>
    Koroth trade spiteful looks.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    Koroth. I see that not all fools<br>
    die young.</p>
  <p> Suddenly an o.c. Klingon interrupts.</p>
  <p> KLINGON VOICE<br>
    Kahless!</p>
  <p> They all turn and see Kahless ENTER the Temple.<br>
    Gowron's men are shocked and even Gowron can't help but<br>
    show some surprise as Kahless moves confidently into<br>
    the room. Gowron glances from Kahless to the large<br>
    painting on the wall... he can't deny the unmistakable<br>
    resemblance. Worf smiles at their reactions. Kahless<br>
    sits in his chair. Data takes an unobtrusive seat in<br>
    the back.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Kahless, may I present Gowron,<br>
    Leader of the High Council.</p>
  <p> Kahless gives him a regal nod.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    You may sit.</p>
  <p> Gowron decides to bide his time for the moment. He<br>
    sits on one of the benches and they follow suit.<br>
    Kahless looks at them for a moment... he seems<br>
    completely in charge... when he speaks, he keeps his<br>
    voice quiet and controlled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Long ago, a storm was heading for<br>
    the city of Quin'lat. Everyone<br>
    took protection within the walls<br>
    except one man who remained<br>
    outside. I went to him and asked<br>
    what he was doing. &quot;I am not<br>
    afraid,&quot; he said. &quot;I will not<br>
    hide my face behind stone and<br>
    mortar. I will stand before the<br>
    wind and make it respect me.&quot; I<br>
    honored his choice and went back<br>
    inside. The next day, the storm<br>
    came... and the man was killed...<br>
    The wind does not respect a fool.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Do not stand before the wind,<br>
    Gowron.</p>
  <p> A murmur goes through the crowd... the other Klingons<br>
    are clearly awestruck by Kahless and the force of his<br>
    personality, but Gowron's attitude only hardens.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What was his name?</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    If you were really there, you<br>
    should be able to tell us the name<br>
    of the man outside the walls.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    What kind of question is that?</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I did not ask you, Koroth. I<br>
    asked him.<br>
    (to Kahless)<br>
    Describe him to us... what was he<br>
    wearing? How tall was he? What<br>
    color were his eyes?</p>
  <p> Koroth is definitely agitated, but Kahless seems<br>
    unconcerned.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    I do not remember. It was long<br>
    ago, and in another lifetime.<br>

  <p>53 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> KAHLESS (Cont'd)<br>
    (stands, strong)<br>
    All that matters is that I have<br>
    returned to restore faith and hope<br>
    to my people... to lead them back<br>
    to the way of honor... to the<br>
    glory that was once theirs and can<br>
    be again. Is that what you<br>
    oppose, Gowron?</p>
  <p> Gowron stands and faces him squarely.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I oppose you. I say you are not<br>
    Kahless... and I will not bend my<br>
    knee to you as long as I can draw<br>
    a breath or pick up a blade.</p>
  <p> Gowron drops his cloak, pulls a knife from his belt and<br>
    stands waiting for Kahless. Koroth starts to move<br>
    between them, but Worf stops him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Koroth)<br>
    No. I do not believe Kahless will<br>
    kill him.</p>
  <p> Koroth stops and steps back, but his look of worry is<br>
    directed at Kahless, not Gowron. Kahless calmly pulls<br>
    a knife of his own and the two men square off in the<br>
    center of the room.</p>
  <p> They circle each other warily for a moment, seeking an<br>
    opening. Kahless is confident and calm... Gowron is<br>
    deadly. Gowron takes a swipe at Kahless, who parries<br>
    it. Kahless smiles... he's trying to transcend the<br>
    moment as he did with Worf in Act Two.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    A good try, Gowron... but not<br>
    enough.</p>
  <p> Kahless makes an attack of his own, but Gowron easily<br>
    stops it and he fights back viciously. Kahless backs<br>
    up under the assault... then throws off Gowron for a<br>
    moment. Kahless laughs loudly. Gowron looks at him in<br>
    puzzlement.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    You have no joy, Gowron. Is your<br>
    heart so filled with distrust and<br>
    suspicion that you have forgotten<br>
    what it is to be truly Klingon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FOUR 52.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> But Gowron's heart cannot be turned as easily as<br>
    Worf's. He suddenly lunges for Kahless, knocking him<br>
    back... a few more blows and Kahless' knife goes flying<br>
    out of his hand. Kahless is knocked down, helpless.</p>
  <p> Gowron moves in for the kill, raising his knife in the<br>
    air and preparing to plunge it into Kahless' chest.<br>
    Suddenly Worf rushes in and grabs his arm, preventing<br>
    him from striking.</p>
  <p> The room is utterly silent... everyone is transfixed by<br>
    the image of Worf saving the mightiest warrior of them<br>
    all from being killed. Gowron smiles and relaxes... he<br>
    pulls the knife away and looks down at the helpless<br>
    Kahless in triumph.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    &quot;Kahless... the greatest warrior<br>
    of them all... &quot;</p>
  <p> Off Worf's stunned reaction...</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    (hard)<br>
    There is no future here... no<br>
    glorious new era for our people.<br>
    (moves to Kahless)<br>
    Gowron was right, you don't know<br>
    the name of the man who faced the<br>
    storm... you don't even know what<br>
    real Warnog tastes like... and you<br>
    certainly are not the greatest<br>
    warrior of all.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Whoever you are... you're not<br>
    Kahless.</p>
  <p> The words seem to sting Kahless and Koroth moves to get<br>
    Worf out of here.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    You've said enough, now get out.</p>
  <p> Worf grabs Koroth, slams him against the wall and<br>
    glares into his eyes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (deadly)<br>
    You are using the name of Kahless<br>
    in some twisted game... for that<br>
    alone you should die... and if you<br>
    do not tell me what you have done,<br>
    I will kill you right here.</p>
  <p> Koroth looks into Worf's eyes, sees that he means it...<br>
    then looks at Torin. Torin drops his eyes and looks<br>
    away. Finally Koroth acquiesces and Worf releases him.</p>
  <p> Koroth takes a couple of steps around the room,<br>
    gathering his thoughts before speaking. This is very<br>
    difficult for him.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>

  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    The first Kahless?</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly realizes what happened.</p>

    A clone. He is a clone.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What is a... clone?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (disgusted)<br>
    A being created in a laboratory...<br>

    another being. You are a copy...<br>
    a fraud.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    (to Kahless)<br>
    You are not &quot;just&quot; a copy. We<br>
    gave you more than the body of<br>
    Kahless.</p>
  <p> TORIN<br>
    We found a way to imprint specific<br>
    information into your neurosynaptic<br>

    You were not... awakened until the<br>

    Before that time you were<br>

    Kahless?</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    It is not a lie! Genetically, he<br>
    is Kahless. And he is needed by<br>
    our people. You know better than<br>
    anyone the corruption and dishonor<br>
    that is destroying the Empire.<br>
    They need him.</p>

    want Gowron's corruption to infect<br>
    every corner of the Empire? Do<br>
    you want our people to continue<br>
    sacrificing their honor until they<br>
    are no different from Romulans?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you tell Gowron what we have<br>
    told you, it will destroy --<br>
    (nods at Kahless)<br>
    -- him... and with him the last<br>
    chance to restore hope to our<br>
    people. It's your choice.</p>
  <p> Worf steps back, looks one last time at Kahless, then<br>
    EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>55 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE &amp; KLINGON SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The two ships as seen before.</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/15/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>57 INT. HOLODECK/TEMPLE</p>
  <p> The Temple as seen before. Worf ENTERS and sees TWO<br>
    N.D. KLINGONS sitting cross-legged on the floor in<br>
    front of the Kahless painting with a couple of lighted<br>
    candles and Klingons artifacts in front of them. Worf<br>
    is surprised to see them here... he begins to move<br>
    closer to them, but before getting there, he hears<br>
    Data's voice.</p>
  <p> DATA'S VOICE<br>
    (o.c.)<br>
    They have been here for three<br>
    hours seventeen minutes.</p>
  <p>58 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Including Data, who is sitting on one of the back<br>
    benches, observing.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    They refused to transport back to<br>
    the ship with the rest of Gowron's<br>
    men. They insisted on waiting<br>
    here until they see Kahless again.<br>
    Their faith appears to be<br>
    unaffected by his inability to<br>
    defeat Gowron. They still<br>
    believe.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at them with pity.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then they are fools.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Does that mean you no longer<br>
    believe this is the real Kahless?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>58 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (difficult)<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am curious. Do you still<br>
    believe that the real Kahless will<br>
    return someday? Or has this<br>
    experience only deepened the<br>
    spiritual crisis which originally<br>
    sent you to Boreth?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I... do not know.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand your dilemma. I once<br>
    had what could be considered a<br>
    crisis of the spirit.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    You?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. The Starfleet officers who<br>
    first activated me on Omicron<br>
    Theta told me that I was an<br>
    android -- nothing more than a<br>
    very sophisticated machine in<br>
    human form.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    However I realized that if I were<br>
    simply a machine, then I could<br>
    never be anything else -- I could<br>
    not grow beyond my programming.<br>
    I found that difficult to accept.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I chose to believe that I was a<br>
    person, that I had the potential<br>
    to become more than a collection<br>
    of circuits and subprocessors.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It is a belief that I still hold.</p>

  <p>58 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How did you come to your decision?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe I made a... &quot;leap of<br>
    faith.&quot;</p>
  <p> Worf looks over at the Klingons sitting on the floor.<br>
    As he considers Data's words...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>59 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Gowron and Koroth are both trying to browbeat Picard<br>
    into agreeing to their requests while Kahless sits at<br>
    the table in silence... a man watching others argue<br>
    over his fate. TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS stand watch<br>
    in the b.g.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (re: Kahless)<br>
    I will not allow the Enterprise to<br>
    enter Klingon space with him on<br>
    board.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The Klingon High Council asked you<br>
    to bring Kahless to the Home<br>
    World. Only they can withdraw the<br>
    request. The Enterprise must<br>
    continue on its mission.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    There is no mission, Koroth...<br>
    your plan has failed.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    I will enjoy watching the life<br>
    bleed from your veins.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gentlemen, please. Let us stick<br>
    to the issue at--</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS the room. He moves to Kahless and the two<br>
    men share a silent look for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, will you excuse us for a<br>
    moment?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and indicates for the Guards to follow<br>
    him. They all EXIT. Once they're gone, everyone looks<br>
    to Worf to see what he will do. After a beat, Worf<br>
    moves to Gowron.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The man that appeared to me on<br>
    Boreth is not the real Kahless.<br>
    He is a clone.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    A clone!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Koroth looks bitter and disappointed. Gowron looks at<br>
    him in triumph.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (to Koroth)<br>
    Did you really think you would get<br>
    away with this kind of fraud? I<br>
    will have you and this abomination<br>
    put to death with --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (hard)<br>
    It does not matter, Gowron. You<br>
    will still not be able to stand<br>
    against him.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What? He's not real. You just<br>
    said so.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I said he was not the real<br>
    Kahless... but in the minds of<br>
    our people he can be just as<br>
    powerful as Kahless.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Even now, two members of your own<br>
    crew are sitting on our<br>
    Holodeck... waiting for him to<br>
    return.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    I do not care what they think.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    They are not alone... like many of<br>
    our people, they need something to<br>
    believe in... just as I did...<br>
    something larger than<br>
    themselves... something that will<br>
    give their lives meaning. They<br>
    need Kahless.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    But when they find out the<br>
    truth... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It will not matter. Despite the<br>
    facts, they will still believe...<br>
    They will... make a leap of<br>
    faith... and there will be others<br>
    just like them... not everyone...<br>
    but enough to plunge the Empire<br>
    into civil war if you oppose them.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What are you saying? That I<br>
    should just... hand over the<br>
    Empire?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No... that would be unwise as<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    Then what are you proposing, Worf?</p>
  <p> Worf moves to Kahless and looks at him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE 63.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You were right about one thing,<br>
    Koroth... our people are becoming<br>
    corrupt and decadent... they need<br>
    moral leadership. Kahless can be<br>
    that leader... as Emperor.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (outraged)<br>
    There hasn't been an Emperor in<br>
    three centuries!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The political power would remain<br>
    with the High Council. Kahless<br>
    would be... a figurehead. But he<br>
    would have the ability to rally<br>
    the people... to lead by<br>
    example... and guide them in<br>
    spiritual matters.</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    The title is meaningless without<br>
    the power to back it up.</p>
  <p> Worf ignores him and addresses Kahless directly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Real power is in the heart. You<br>
    would have the power to mold the<br>
    Klingon heart... you could return<br>
    them to honorable ways...<br>
    according to the original<br>
    teachings of Kahless, which are<br>
    within you... it would be a great<br>
    challenge, if you have the courage<br>
    to accept it.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    And what will we tell the people<br>
    about their new Emperor? That he<br>
    appeared in a cave or a<br>
    laboratory?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We will tell them the truth... all<br>
    of the truth. But we will also<br>
    tell them that even if he is not<br>
    the real Kahless... he is the<br>
    rightful heir to Kahless.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    And if I refuse to go along with<br>
    this?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - 03/08/93 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then my brother and all who<br>
    support him on the Council will<br>
    fight you... and I will fight<br>
    you... and the Empire will fall<br>
    back into civil war.</p>
  <p> Gowron considers that for a moment... finally turns to<br>
    Koroth.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    What do you say to this, Koroth?</p>
  <p> Koroth thinks for a moment... then turns to Kahless</p>
  <p> KOROTH<br>
    What I say is unimportant. What<br>
    do you say?</p>
  <p> Kahless and Worf exchange a long look... then Kahless<br>
    finds some strength deep down within himself and he<br>
    rises up out of the chair, regal and proud.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    It is acceptable.</p>
  <p> Koroth drops to one knee. Worf looks at Gowron, then<br>
    Worf goes down on one knee.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Join with me, Gowron. Let us<br>
    usher in this new era together.</p>
  <p> Gowron takes a beat, looks at Kahless, then finally<br>
    bends his knee as well.</p>
  <p> GOWRON<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Vorcha-doh-baghK... Kahless.</p>
  <p> Off the look on Kahless' face.</p>

  <p>60 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf is saying good-bye to Kahless.</p>

    Good-bye.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot; - REV. 03/09/93 - ACT FIVE 65.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> There is a trace of sadness in Worf's voice and a<br>
    dispirited look on his face which Kahless picks up on.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    What's wrong? You should be proud<br>
    of what you have accomplished.</p>
  <p> Worf shakes his head.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I went to Boreth to find my<br>
    faith... and for a time I thought<br>
    I did... but now, my heart is<br>
    empty again. I do not know what<br>
    to believe...</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    You doubt the real Kahless will<br>
    return one day... you doubt that<br>
    he is still waiting for you in Sto-Vo-Kor?</p>
  <p> Worf nods. Kahless takes a beat and then reaches deep<br>
    down inside... and when he speaks it is the first<br>
    inkling of what this man can one day become for his<br>
    people... a true leader.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Kahless left us -- all of us -- a<br>
    powerful legacy... a way of<br>
    thinking and acting that makes us<br>
    Klingon. If his words hold wisdom<br>
    and his philosophy is honorable...<br>
    then does it really matter if he<br>
    returns? What is important is<br>
    whether we follow his teachings...<br>
    perhaps the words are more<br>
    important than the man.</p>
  <p> Worf considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> KAHLESS<br>
    Q'apla, son of Mogh.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Q'apla... Kahless.</p>
  <p> Kahless steps up on the stage and then DEMATERIALIZES.<br>
    Off Worf's thoughtful expression...</p>
