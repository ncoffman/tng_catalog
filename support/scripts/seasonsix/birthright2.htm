  <p> (NOTE: Episode begins with a 90 second RECAP of Part<br>
    I.)</p>
  <p>1 INT. MEETING HALL - MOMENTS LATER</p>
  <p> L'KOR and the other Klingons have taken WORF back<br>
    toward the center of the room; the Romulan Guards<br>
    remain near the door.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We cannot leave this place.</p>
  <p> Worf can think of only one reason why:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you afraid to die escaping?</p>
  <p> L'Kor fixes him with a cold look.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We are dead, Worf. We died at<br>
    Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at them for an explanation.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    We were captured. It was worse<br>
    than death.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you allow it to happen?</p>
  <p> GI'RAL is angered by what Worf's question implies.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    We had no choice!<br>
    (she explains)<br>
    We were defending an outpost on<br>
    the perimeter... the Romulans took<br>
    out our shields... their next<br>
    blast rendered us unconscious...<br>
    when we awoke... we were<br>
    prisoners... unarmed and shackled.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf reacts almost viscerally to this humiliation.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We were interrogated for three<br>
    months. We tried to starve<br>
    ourselves... but they kept us<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    The Romulan Commander -- Tokath--<br>
    thought he was being kind.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    The Romulans hoped to trade our<br>
    lives for territorial concessions.<br>
    But the Klingon High Council<br>
    refused to negotiate.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They would not acknowledge their<br>
    warriors had been taken prisoner.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    When it was clear that we would be<br>
    of no use to them, Tokath offered<br>
    to let us go.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    But we knew that our families<br>
    believed we had fallen in battle.<br>
    We did not wish to return and<br>
    dishonor them.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    We asked Tokath to let us stay.<br>
    He took pity on us.</p>
  <p> Worf takes all this in. After a beat:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand your desire to<br>
    preserve your families' honor.<br>
    But what of your own? There is no<br>
    honor in remaining prisoners.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We lost our honor when we were<br>
    captured. It does not matter what<br>
    happens to us.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    All that matters is that our<br>
    families are not dishonored.</p>
  <p> One of the Elders has been going through Worf's<br>
    backpack and steps forward to give L'Kor something he<br>
    found -- it is Worf's COMBADGE.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    This is Starfleet... where did you<br>
    get it?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am a Starfleet officer.</p>
  <p> Several of the Klingons laugh out loud at this<br>
    assertion.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Much has changed since Khitomer.</p>
  <p> L'Kor looks at Worf and sees that he's telling the<br>
    truth.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    It does not matter. The world<br>
    outside these walls no longer<br>
    exists for us. We do not speak of<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    You should try to forget that<br>
    world as well.</p>
  <p> L'Kor regards Worf sadly.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Why did you come here, Worf? If<br>
    you had found your father... you<br>
    would have found only dishonor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If he had been captured as you<br>
    were, if I had found him here...<br>
    I would be glad to see him. There<br>
    would be no room in my heart for<br>
    shame.</p>
  <p> L'Kor takes this in, his expression unreadable.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Much has changed since Khitomer.<br>
    I can only hope that if my son<br>
    came here... he would be Klingon<br>
    enough to kill me.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> With this, L'Kor turns and leaves the room. Off Worf's<br>
    reaction we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>2 EXT. COMPOUND (DAY)</p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 ANGLE - WORF</p>
  <p> He is sitting alone on a BENCH to one side of the<br>
    compound, surveying it. He looks around at the<br>
    activity in the compound -- a young man is gardening;<br>
    a group of young people run and play a game; three men<br>
    play a game with dice.</p>
  <p> People go about their business, occasionally casting<br>
    surreptitious glances at the stranger in their midst.<br>
    Every time Worf's eye meets someone else's, they seem<br>
    to turn away and return to what they were doing.</p>
  <p> This place is more a village than a prison -- flowers<br>
    are planted near the well tended barracks; the wall<br>
    that once served to pen prisoners is still there, but<br>
    the gate is left open and people come and go at will.</p>
  <p> While there are several generations of Klingons in the<br>
    camp, the only Romulans are the middle-aged guards who<br>
    have been at this post for the last twenty years. Worf<br>
    is the first person they've had to guard in a long time<br>
    and they have to remind themselves to keep an eye on<br>
    him and not be distracted by the goings on in the camp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf stands and begins to walk the perimeter of the<br>
    compound wall, eyeing possible avenues of escape. The<br>
    Guards keep a watchful eye.</p>
  <p> Worf's path takes him past a young man tending a<br>
    vegetable patch at one end of the compound. The young<br>
    man, TOQ, looks up from his hoeing, but when he sees<br>
    it's Worf he resumes his work as if he has no interest<br>
    in the stranger.</p>
  <p> Worf is about to continue his reconnoitering when he<br>
    notices what Toq is using to hoe the ground: an<br>
    elaborately carved Klingon BATTLE SPEAR.</p>
  <p> Without hesitation, Worf marches toward him and<br>
    snatches it from his hand.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This is a Gin'tak spear.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    (reaching for it)<br>
    What of it?</p>
  <p> Worf is outraged.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Have your parents taught you<br>
    nothing? This is used for battle --<br>
    not for tilling soil.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    We have no need for weapons here.<br>
    The war is far away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What war?</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    (it's obvious)<br>
    The war our parents came here to<br>
    escape.</p>
  <p> Worf realizes that the young people have not been told<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That war... has been over for<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> Toq looks at him skeptically, and snatches the spear<br>
    back from him -- Worf doesn't resist.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I'm not interested in what you<br>
    have to say, Klingon. I have work<br>
    to do.</p>
  <p> He turns away and resumes his hoeing. Worf watches him<br>
    for a moment, then walks away, dismayed by the young<br>
    man's total ignorance of his culture.</p>
  <p> He looks over at the Romulan Guards and sees that they<br>
    have been watching the whole thing. They seem a bit on<br>
    edge, as if uncertain how to react to the stranger's<br>
    behavior. Worf decides to play it cool so as not to<br>
    provoke them. He returns to where he was sitting<br>
    before.</p>
  <p> After a moment, Worf looks up and sees that BA'EL, the<br>
    young woman he saw in the woods, is looking at him.<br>
    She is the first person in the camp to hold his gaze,<br>
    and Worf returns it without realizing it... suddenly<br>
    they both become embarrassed and look away.</p>
  <p> After a beat, she approaches him.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Hello again, Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf acknowledges with a curt nod.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    They say you're going to stay here<br>
    with us.</p>
  <p> Worf realizes she too hasn't been told everything.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not by choice.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Aren't you happy to escape the<br>
    war?</p>
  <p> Worf looks at her, beginning to realize the extent of<br>
    the lie they've been told.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The war...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Yes... we've heard the stories all<br>
    our lives. How people are<br>
    slaughtered in terrible battles...<br>
    forced to fight, whether they want<br>
    to or not. That's why our parents<br>
    came here -- to make a safe<br>
    home... a place where they could<br>
    raise their children in peace.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I should think you'd be relieved<br>
    to get away from the fighting.<br>
    You're safe here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A place can be safe -- and still<br>
    be a prison. Where I come from,<br>
    people are free to come and go as<br>
    they choose.</p>
  <p> Ba'el thinks he's misread the situation. Ingenuously --</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    So are we.</p>
  <p> Worf regards the young woman.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Tell your Father you would like to<br>
    leave. Tell him you want to visit<br>
    the Klingon home world. See what<br>
    he says.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Ba'el looks at him, considers. There is something<br>
    almost defensive in her voice when she replies.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Why would I want to go there?<br>
    It's dangerous.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Not any longer.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Gi'ral calls out to her daughter from across<br>
    the compound.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    (off-camera)<br>
    Ba'el! Come here!</p>
  <p> Ba'el and Worf look up and see Gi'ral heading toward<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Yes, mother.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    You are not allowed to leave the<br>
    compound?</p>
  <p> Worf shakes his head no. She stands.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    (flirting)<br>
    Then I suppose I won't be seeing<br>
    you at the pond again.</p>
  <p> Worf looks away uncomfortably and she smiles and moves<br>
    toward her mother.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    (a harsh whisper)<br>
    I told you not to speak with him.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I'm sorry, mother.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> With a last glance back at Worf, Ba'el crosses away<br>
    with her Mother.</p>
  <p> After a moment, TWO FAINT BEEPS are heard. Worf<br>
    touches the TRANSPONDER hidden in his hem, then stands<br>
    and crosses toward his quarters.</p>
  <p>5 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS and takes out the TRANSPONDER Shrek gave<br>
    him. It is FLASHING, indicating that Shrek's shuttle<br>
    has returned.</p>
  <p> Worf hides the TRANSPONDER again and considers his<br>
    options. He crosses to the light control panel and<br>
    inspects it. He pries it off the wall with his fingers<br>
    in order to get at the circuity inside. He removes a<br>
    piece of circuitry and begins to reconfigure it.</p>
  <p> The sound of approaching footsteps prompts him to close<br>
    the panel and move to his bunk.</p>
  <p> There is a knock at the door.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> The door swings open to reveal a middle-aged Romulan<br>
    standing there. It is TOKATH, the officer mentioned by<br>
    Gi'ral and L'Kor.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I am Tokath.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the name, but says nothing.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I can return later if I am<br>
    disturbing you... ?</p>
  <p> Worf fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a strange thing when a<br>
    jailer concerns himself with his<br>
    prisoner's comfort.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Mine is a strange prison.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You robbed the Klingons of who<br>
    they were. You dishonored them.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    (challenging)<br>
    By not slitting their throats when<br>
    we found them unconscious?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't expect you to understand.<br>
    You are a Romulan.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    You're just like L'Kor was twenty<br>
    years ago. Proud and angry. He<br>
    hated me; all the Klingons did.<br>
    And I had no love for them -- I<br>
    won't deny it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    When I informed the High Command<br>
    that the Klingons wanted to remain<br>
    here... I was told that unless I<br>
    stayed to oversee them myself,<br>
    they would be killed.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My decision ended my military<br>
    career.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why did you do it?</p>
  <p> Tokath regards him for a beat.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I don't expect you to understand.<br>
    You're a Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at him, perplexed by this complicated man.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    But I do expect you to understand<br>
    this: we've put aside the old<br>
    hatreds. Here, Romulans and<br>
    Klingons live in peace. I won't<br>
    allow you to destroy what we have.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do not deceive yourself. These<br>
    people are not happy here. I see<br>
    sadness in their eyes.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    That's not what I see when I look<br>
    in my wife's eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf looks up sharply. Tokath regards him solemnly.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I married a Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    So you see, when I warn you not to<br>
    disrupt our lives here, I'm not<br>
    speaking just as a jailer... but<br>
    as a man protecting his family.</p>
  <p> He fixes Worf with a look.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Do not test my tolerance.</p>
  <p> He turns on his heel and EXITS, leaving Worf still<br>
    reeling from his revelation.</p>
  <p>6 EXT. COMPOUND (DAY)</p>
  <p> A Klingon woman puts an empty container in a storage<br>
    barrel set against the compound wall.</p>
  <p> Worf sees her, then looks over to see if the guards are<br>
    looking at him. He ambles his way toward the barrel as<br>
    if heading in no particular direction.</p>
  <p> When he's near it, he checks to make sure he isn't<br>
    being watched and tosses the circuitry he took from the<br>
    light panel into the barrel.</p>
  <p> He crosses over to where Ba'el is sitting with a woman<br>
    who is rocking her CHILD to sleep in her arms. Ba'el<br>
    is softly signing a lullaby in Klingon.</p>
  <p> Worf recognizes the words as being the same as the aria<br>
    L'Kor sang the first night. As before, there is<br>
    something about the way it is being sung that makes him<br>
    frown slightly.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo.<br>
    ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo</p>
  <p> van'aj javDIch Qong DIr Sa'VIch<br>
    ghIH yot quelI'Pa qevas HoH Qa</p>
  <p> She looks up when he approaches and smiles as she<br>
    finishes the gentle melody -- the child is asleep.</p>

  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Do you know what that song means?</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    No. I just like the melody.</p>
  <p> Worf is disturbed to hear this. Suddenly there is an<br>
    EXPLOSION in the barrel. Everyone rushes toward it to<br>
    see what is happening except Worf. He backs away until<br>
    he's near the wall, then turns and begins to climb it.</p>
  <p> Ba'el looks back to see where Worf is, and catches a<br>
    glimpse of him as he skips over the wall. Her heart<br>
    leaps to her throat but she says nothing... he is gone.</p>
  <p> Suddenly one of the Romulans spies Worf and trips a<br>
    warning KLAXON.</p>
  <p>7 EXT. JUNGLE (DAY)</p>
  <p> as Worf makes his way through it at a run. He reacts<br>
    to the sound of the klaxon and hurries away.</p>

  <p>8 HIS PURSUERS</p>
  <p> as the Romulan guards push through the same area of<br>
    vegetation Worf just passed -- they are only moments<br>
    behind him.</p>

  <p>9 WORF</p>
  <p> as he glances back over his shoulder and changes<br>
    direction.</p>
  <p>10 HIS PURSUERS</p>
  <p> as they crane their heads to try and catch a glimpse of<br>
    their quarry through the foliage.</p>
  <p>11 WORF</p>
  <p> as he comes to the pond where he saw Ba'el and splashes<br>
    his way through it, then up the other side and away.</p>
  <p>12 HIS PURSUERS</p>
  <p> as they come to the pond. Some go around, some<br>
    through.</p>
  <p>13 WORF</p>
  <p> as he hides in some fronds. Two booted figures pass<br>
    within feet of him as they search for him. When<br>
    they're gone, he steals away in another direction.</p>
  <p>14 HIS PURSUERS</p>
  <p> as they catch sight of him through a break in the<br>
    foliage and resume their chase.</p>
  <p>15 WORF</p>
  <p> as he comes to a clearing and sees a figure standing on<br>
    the other side -- it is SHREK, the alien who brought<br>
    him to the planet. Through the foliage, we catch a<br>
    glimmer of his shuttle's hull.</p>
  <p>16 SHREK</p>
  <p> as he waves Worf to come toward him. Suddenly a look<br>
    of concern crosses his features.</p>
  <p>17 WORF</p>
  <p> as he reacts to the change of expression on Shrek's<br>
    face -- too late. Suddenly he's tackled to the ground<br>
    by a figure that lunges into the frame.</p>

    into the foliage.</p>
  <p>19 WORF</p>
  <p> on the ground, wrestling with whoever tackled him. He<br>
    manages to throw the figure off him and is stunned to<br>
    discover that it is Toq, the young Klingon who was<br>
    tending the garden.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts to the discovery that he is being chased by<br>
    his own kind. Before he can do anything the Romulan<br>
    guards come crashing through the brush brandishing<br>
    weapons.</p>
  <p> Worf is caught. Off Toq's look of satisfaction we...</p>

  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (v.o.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46580.1.<br>
    The Yridian vessel Lieutenant Worf<br>
    boarded at Deep Space Nine has<br>
    failed to arrive for our scheduled<br>
    rendezvous. It is now twelve<br>
    hours overdue.</p>
  <p>21 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD ENTERS from his Ready Room. RIKER, DATA, TROI<br>
    and various N.D's are at their posts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Still no sign of them on long<br>
    range scanners, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard looks concerned.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Contact DS Nine -- find out what<br>
    they know about this Yridian<br>
    trader.</p>
  <p> Riker moves toward an Aft station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hopefully he filed a flight plan<br>
    before he left the station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    That's the only chance we have of<br>
    finding Worf.</p>

  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard settles into his chair next to Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When Worf asked for leave... I had<br>
    the feeling he was hoping none of<br>
    it was true: that his father was<br>
    dead, that he hadn't been<br>
    captured.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I think part of him was hoping<br>
    that. But another part of him<br>
    wanted more than anything to find<br>
    his father.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure that's true.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if Mogh... or any other<br>
    Klingon... had been held prisoner<br>
    for twenty years... would they<br>
    want to be found?</p>
  <p> Troi acknowledges his point. Off their shared<br>
    concern...</p>

  <p> Establishing.</p>
  <p>23 INT. MEETING HALL (DAY)</p>
  <p> Tokath ENTERS. L'Kor is with Worf, who is seated. The<br>
    tension in the room is palpable. Toq and a Romulan<br>
    guard stand off to the side, weapons in hand.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I have alerted the Romulan border<br>
    patrols to be on the lookout for<br>
    a Yridian ship.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    If it escapes... others will learn<br>
    that we're here.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I've ordered surveillance stepped<br>
    up. If there are more intruders,<br>
    we'll stop them.</p>
  <p> Tokath signals the guards. Toq and the Romulan step<br>
    forward. The Romulan aims his weapon at Worf's head so<br>
    that he won't resist, and Toq grabs Worf's arm and<br>
    pulls his sleeve up.</p>
  <p> Tokath pulls a HYPO type device from his pocket.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    We haven't had to use one of these<br>
    in a long time.</p>
  <p> He holds the device to Worf's skin and administers an<br>
    injection.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    It implants a small boridium<br>
    pellet under the skin... we can<br>
    use its energy signature to track<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Worf looks down at his arm with a grim expression.<br>
    L'Kor regards him, his face almost sympathetic.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    In time, you will grow accustomed<br>
    to life here.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at him with undisguised distaste.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Never.</p>
  <p> Tokath realizes the intransigent Klingon will not<br>
    accept his captivity easily.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    (to L'Kor)<br>
    He is one of yours. Deal with him<br>
    however you like.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I warn you... if he becomes a<br>
    disruption, I will not be so<br>
    tolerant.</p>
  <p> L'Kor nods and Tokath turns and EXITS. L'Kor turns to<br>
    Worf and regards him with a steely expression.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Toq... you will guard him.</p>
  <p> The youth steps forward.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    (indicating Worf)<br>
    He is free to move around inside<br>
    the compound. But make certain he<br>
    does not cause trouble.</p>
  <p> L'Kor and the Romulan guard turn away and EXIT. Worf<br>
    and Toq size each other up. Toq is pleased to be<br>
    trusted with this assignment and intends to be<br>
    vigilant.</p>

  <p>24 OMITTED</p>
  <p>25 WORF</p>
  <p> as he comes around a corner into the space between two<br>
    barracks. He smashes a fist against a barrack wall in<br>
    frustration. Realizing he has to get hold of himself,<br>
    he takes a deep breath and straightens his spine. He<br>
    holds two fingers together and passes them down along<br>
    the length of his torso -- this is the first movement<br>
    of the Mok'bara, the Klingon martial art we saw him<br>
    doing in Part One.</p>
  <p> He begins to do the forms of the ritual exercise --<br>
    deliberate and controlled, centering himself.</p>
  <p>26 INTERCUT WITH BYSTANDERS</p>
  <p> as they begin to notice what the stranger is doing.<br>
    Several teenaged Klingons watch Worf in fascination.<br>
    Ba'el comes to see what they are looking at, as does<br>
    Toq -- though everybody keeps their distance.</p>
  <p> Ba'el decides to approach Worf.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> Worf leans into a forward thrust and holds the<br>
    position.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Mok'bara...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The forms clear the mind... and<br>
    center the body.</p>
  <p> He stands and pivots into a new position, moving his<br>
    arm in front of him in a controlled arc. Ba'el tries<br>
    to mimic the movement. Worf sees her awkward attempt<br>
    and does it again for her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No. Like this...</p>
  <p> She tries again, better this time. Ba'el looks at him,<br>
    intrigued. He does another movement, slowly -- a<br>
    second time for her benefit. She mimics it, and Worf<br>
    notices TWO YOUNG MEN at a distance, trying the forms<br>
    themselves. After a hesitant glance at each other,<br>
    they cross over to him.</p>
  <p> Behind them, Toq looks on... concerned.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to the gathered young<br>
    people)<br>
    This is the Mok'bara... a great<br>
    warrior called Kahless invented<br>
    the forms when he went to the<br>
    underworld in search of his<br>
    father. Kahless showed him the<br>
    forms, and his father was able to<br>
    remember his body and return to<br>
    the world of the living.</p>
  <p> The young people look on in fascination.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    First you must learn to breathe...<br>
    stand up... as tall as you can...</p>
  <p> They do as he says.</p>

  <p>27 ANGLE - TOQ</p>
  <p> as he decides Worf shouldn't be doing this and begins<br>
    to cross toward him.</p>
  <p>28 WORF</p>
  <p> as he corrects one of the young men.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Take a wider stance.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Toq is behind Worf and reaches to grab him by<br>
    the shoulder.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    You must stop --</p>
  <p> But before he knows what is happening, Worf has grabbed<br>
    him by the arm and flipped him over so that he is<br>
    holding him from behind. It happens so fast Toq can't<br>
    even resist.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The forms are the basis for<br>
    Klingon combat. You would be wise<br>
    to learn them.</p>
  <p> Worf stands Toq up and lets him go.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I will teach you. Join us.</p>
  <p> Toq straightens his tunic and glares at Worf.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    We'll see what L'Kor thinks of<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> He stomps away in anger. Worf looks after him, then<br>
    turns back to the others.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Again... take your stance...</p>
  <p> Off the faces of the gathered youths...</p>
  <p>29 INT. BA'EL'S FAMILY'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> A redress of Worf's quarters, though these are<br>
    cluttered with the trappings of a family's everyday<br>
    life. Ba'el sticks her head in the door.</p>

  <p> Ba'el leads Worf inside. She takes him to a corner and<br>
    pulls a CLOTH off a large CHEST.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    This is what I wanted to show you.</p>
  <p> She opens the chest and Worf sees that it is packed<br>
    with Klingon ARTIFACTS: armor, knives, insignia, arm<br>
    bands, etc.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I don't know why, but I'm not<br>
    supposed to look at these things.</p>
  <p> She reaches inside and pulls out an armored BREASTPLATE.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    They're Klingon, aren't they?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I thought you might be able to<br>
    tell me about them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (pointing to breastplate)<br>
    This is a warrior's armor.</p>
  <p> He pulls out a ceremonial dagger, inspects it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And this is the D'k tahg...</p>
  <p> He brushes at some rust on the blade.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It should not be allowed to rust<br>
    like this...</p>
  <p> Ba'el reaches inside and pulls out a beautiful AMULET<br>
    hanging on a chain.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Isn't it beautiful?</p>
  <p> She puts it around her neck. Worf leans in to look at<br>
    the design of the amulet -- he and Ba'el are very<br>
    close, their heads almost touching.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    That is a Jinaq... it is given to<br>
    a daughter when she comes of age,<br>
    old enough to take a mate.</p>
  <p> Ba'el blushes and looks down. Worf realizes and is<br>
    suddenly uncomfortable as well. Suddenly:</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    (off-camera)<br>
    Ba'el!</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Mother --</p>
  <p> Gi'ral ENTERS and sees Ba'el wearing the amulet.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    Take that off at once.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Why is she forbidden to know what<br>
    these things are?</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    They do not matter here. Go.</p>
  <p> Ba'el gestures that he should comply. Worf contains<br>
    his frustration and EXITS.</p>
  <p>30 EXT. COMPOUND (NIGHT)</p>
  <p> Worf is recounting a Klingon myth around the campfire.<br>
    His listeners are mostly young people, including Ba'el,<br>
    their faces in rapt attention as he tells the story.<br>
    An old Klingon woman sits nearby, listening and<br>
    nodding. Toq sits further away, smirking to himself at<br>
    the parts of the story he finds less than credible.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    ... Kahless held his father's<br>
    lifeless body in his arms. He<br>
    could not believe what his brother<br>
    had done. Then his brother threw<br>
    their father's sword into the sea,<br>
    saying that if he could not<br>
    possess it, neither would Kahless.<br>
    That was the last time the<br>
    brothers would speak.</p>

  <p>32 SCENE</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    What happened to the sword?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless looked into the ocean and<br>
    wept, for the sword was all he had<br>
    left of his father... and the sea<br>
    filled with his tears and flooded<br>
    beyond the shore.</p>
  <p> Toq scoffs to himself.</p>

    He searched and searched the murky<br>
    ocean bottom, holding his breath<br>
    for three days and three nights...</p>
  <p> This is too much for Toq and he scoffs out loud:</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    That is impossible!</p>
  <p> Worf fixes him with a look.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For you, perhaps. Not for<br>
    Kahless. He was a great warrior.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    You're making it up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    These are our stories. They tell<br>

  <p> L'KOR<br>
    It is late. It is time to sleep.</p>
  <p> The young people grumble a little but stand to go.<br>
    Ba'el gives Worf a long look as she leaves. L'Kor<br>
    stands there until the young people are all gone... his<br>
    eyes locked on Worf's. They face off, as if a silent<br>
    battle is engaged. At last, L'Kor turns and disappears<br>
    into the shadows.</p>

    Yes. He found it.</p>
  <p> She moves closer.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    The stories you tell... are they<br>
    true?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have studied them all my life...<br>

  <p> Around them, the camp is asleep. They are alone in the<br>

  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Tell me...</p>
  <p> She moves very close to him. Worf can't resist his<br>
    attraction to her. He closes his eyes... leans in<br>
    close, takes her scent in the Klingon manner. Their<br>
    cheeks touch... he nuzzles her neck, relishing the<br>
    smell of her skin.</p>
  <p> He reaches up to touch her hair, the side of her<br>
    head... he pulls her hair back off her ears and is<br>
    stunned to see that they are pointed like a<br>
    Romulan's... He reacts viscerally, pulls away. He<br>
    stares at her, uncomprehending.</p>

  <p> Worf has moved away from Ba'el, doesn't face her. She<br>
    walks toward him, perplexed by his attitude.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Tokath is my father. I thought<br>
    you knew that.</p>
  <p> Worf can't even get his mind around it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How could your mother... mate with<br>
    a... Romulan?</p>
  <p> Ba'el is equally unable to understand Worf's attitude.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Why shouldn't she?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is... an obscenity.</p>
  <p> Ba'el's face falls... she is stunned by the intensity<br>
    of his feelings.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    What are you saying? They love<br>
    each other...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Romulans are treacherous...<br>
    deceitful... they are without<br>
    honor.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    My father is a good man. He is<br>
    kind, and generous... there is<br>
    nothing dishonorable about him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He was part of a cowardly attack<br>
    on Khitomer... thousands of<br>
    Klingons were massacred -- many of<br>
    them women and children.</p>

  <p> She stares at him.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I don't know what you're talking<br>
    about. My father came here to<br>
    escape the wars. He would never<br>
    kill anyone.</p>
  <p> Worf turns on her, impatient with the lies.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ask him. Ask your mother. Tell<br>
    them you want to know the truth.</p>
  <p> Their eyes lock for a moment; hers in a moment of<br>
    uncertainty... a realization that they have taken a<br>
    step that can never be taken back... a wish that they<br>
    could regain the romantic feelings that had threatened<br>
    to overwhelm them just a few moments ago. But Worf's<br>
    eyes are cold. She turns and leaves without another<br>
    word.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He gets around... he's been to<br>

    past week -- he could have left<br>
    Worf at any of them.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns; he was hoping for better evidence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are any of these systems near<br>
    Romulan space?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Two of them. The Nequencia and<br>

  <p> Picard considers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's head for the closer one.</p>

  <p> Ba'el is tidying up somewhat aimlessly, lost in<br>
    thought. There is a knock at the door. She opens it<br>
    and sees Worf standing there. She doesn't let him in.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    (tight)<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I... I am sorry if I upset you.</p>
  <p> Ba'el's face softens at the apology. She moves away<br>
    from the door, tacitly agreeing to hear him out. Worf<br>
    comes in. This is hard for him.</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was surprised... I became angry.<br>
    But I do not blame you. You<br>
    cannot help being what you are.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, sensing that this apology might be<br>
    somewhat qualified.</p>

  <p>40 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    There's nothing wrong with what I<br>
    am.</p>
  <p> Worf tries to explain.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What I mean is... it is not your<br>
    fault.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    What? Being born? I'm sorry if<br>
    that offends you.</p>
  <p> Worf stops at this, tries to grapple with it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, I...</p>
  <p> In his frustration, he falls back on what he knows.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is hard to explain. Klingons<br>
    and Romulans are blood enemies --<br>
    we have been for centuries...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Not here. Here we live in peace.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But I do not live here.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him, making a personal appeal.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Worf... before you knew... you<br>
    were attracted to me.</p>
  <p>STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT THREE32.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf can't deny it.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Can't you leave the hatred behind,<br>
    too? Can't you accept me... as I<br>
    am?</p>
  <p> Worf stares at her, torn... he knows the rightness of<br>
    what she says. But --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I don't know.</p>
  <p> Ba'el is crushed. She turns and RUNS off-camera into<br>
    another room. Worf stares after her for a moment and<br>
    then turns to leave. He sees Gi'ral standing there,<br>
    eyes burning into him.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    What have you done to her?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are responsible. She is what<br>
    she is because of you.<br>
    (with disgust)<br>
    Lying down with a Romulan.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    Who are you to judge me?</p>
  <p> She speaks quietly, but there is an inner intensity<br>
    that burns from her.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    My husband died at Khitomer. We<br>
    had left a son on the Home<br>
    World... five years old. The<br>
    first year I was here I thought I<br>
    would die from the pain of knowing<br>
    I'd never see him again.</p>
  <p> She moves away, pacing as she talks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    Not a day goes by that I don't<br>
    think of him, wonder about him.<br>
    But I will never know who he is.<br>
    I gave him up -- because I loved<br>
    him too much to dishonor him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I understand your sacrifice. And<br>
    I respect it. But to mate with a<br>
    Romulan -- this I do not<br>
    understand.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    By the second year, I had stopped<br>
    weeping for my son. There were<br>
    days when I could even laugh...<br>
    and I began to look around me and<br>
    realize that this would be my<br>
    world forever.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I looked at Tokath... our captor.<br>
    I saw that he was a kind man...<br>
    and a lonely one.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I knew that he was looking at<br>
    me, as well.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him, eyes drilling into him.</p>
  <p> GI'RAL<br>
    In the third year I decided to<br>
    give up hatred... and loneliness.<br>
    I am not ashamed of that decision,<br>
    and I won't be judged for it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Leave this house. You've done<br>
    enough harm.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at her for a moment, conflicted and silent.<br>
    Then he turns and EXITS. Gi'ral stares after him,<br>
    determined to protect her nest.</p>
  <p>41 EXT. COMPOUND (DAY)</p>
  <p> as Worf comes out from the quarters. He looks around<br>
    the compound and his eye is caught by something<br>
    familiar about a GAME a group of young people are<br>
    playing.</p>
  <p> They are rolling a HOOP along the ground with some<br>
    sticks, playing some kind of goal-scoring game with it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf's attention is caught by the brightly COLORED<br>
    BANDS along the shafts of the sticks and the rim of the<br>
    hoop (which is slightly smaller than a hula hoop).</p>
  <p> He crosses toward the players and picks up an unused<br>
    stick, which we now see has a pointed blade on the end<br>
    like a SPEAR. He rolls a hoop along the ground and<br>
    launches the spear at it -- sending it straight through<br>
    the hole in its center and into the ground.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ka'la!</p>
  <p> The young people look at him, astonished by the feat<br>
    and intrigued by Worf's ritual-like words. Toq,<br>
    however, is annoyed.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    That's not how you play this game.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Qa'vak is not a game -- it<br>
    hones the skills of the hunt.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    (mocking)<br>
    The hunt?</p>
  <p> He looks around at his fellows with amusement.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    We have replicators here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Klingons do not hunt because they<br>
    need food. The hunt is a ritual<br>
    that reminds us of where we come<br>
    from.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I know where I come from. Right<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> Worf eyes the defiant youth. He holds up the hoop.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a difficult skill to master.<br>
    Perhaps you are too young.</p>
  <p> Toq rises to the challenge.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Throw it.</p>
  <p>STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/08/93 - ACT THREE35.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Toq stands ready and Worf throws the hoop along the<br>
    ground. Toq launches his spear at the hoop but its<br>
    flight is haphazard and it misses by several yards.<br>
    Toq frowns but Worf spares him humiliation by being<br>
    encouraging.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your arm is strong. But it needs<br>
    practice. Hold your other arm<br>
    like this...<br>
    (he demonstrates)<br>
    ... and aim along it.</p>
  <p> He gestures to his abdomen. Toq grabs another spear<br>
    from a nearby boy, and Worf gestures to the boy who had<br>
    scrambled to retrieve the hoop.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Throw.</p>
  <p> This time, Toq's aim is better and he manages to strike<br>
    the hoop with a glancing blow, deflecting its<br>
    trajectory.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ka'la!</p>
  <p> Toq allows a small smile, pleased in spite of himself.<br>
    Worf nods approvingly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You learn quickly. Perhaps it is<br>
    time to put your skills to the<br>
    test.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come. I will teach you how to<br>
    hunt.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    You're not allowed to leave the<br>
    compound.</p>
  <p> Worf turns and starts heading for the meeting hall.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    They won't allow it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I think they will.</p>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>42 INT. MEETING HALL</p>
  <p>43 CLOSE - TOKATH</p>
  <p> as he laughs at the preposterousness of the request.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Hunting? Have you lost your mind?</p>
  <p>44 WIDEN</p>
  <p> to include L'Kor, Toq and Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The boy could come with me.</p>
  <p> Tokath and L'Kor exchange glances.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I cannot sit in the compound like<br>
    an old man. I must practice my<br>
    skills.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    We can't let you out. You've<br>
    already tried to escape once.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I give you my word as a warrior.<br>
    I will not try to escape.</p>
  <p> Tokath dismisses this and turns away.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Leave us. We have work to do.</p>
  <p> But Worf is still looking at L'Kor, awaiting his<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Tokath... He gave his word.</p>
  <p> Tokath looks at his friend, surprised.</p>
  <p>STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT THREE37.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Are you seriously suggesting we<br>
    open the gates and let him wander<br>
    free... with only a boy as his<br>
    guard?</p>
  <p> Toq bristles a bit at that.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Twenty-three years ago I gave you<br>
    my word. In all this time, have<br>
    I ever broken it?</p>
  <p> Tokath looks at Worf, shrugs.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I told you he was yours to deal<br>
    with. If you want to take this<br>
    risk, the responsibility is yours.</p>
  <p> L'Kor nods, turns to Toq.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    You will go with him. Take a<br>
    weapon. If he breaks his word and<br>
    tries to escape... kill him.</p>
  <p> Off his steely expression...</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>45 EXT. JUNGLE (DAY)</p>
  <p> Toq is following Worf as he makes his way through the<br>
    jungle. Worf carries a SPEAR; Toq has a DISRUPTOR.<br>
    Worf is completely involved in tracking his game and<br>
    takes no notice of Toq's uneasiness.</p>
  <p> Worf suddenly plunges into some bushes; alarmed, Toq<br>
    follows, disruptor drawn and aimed at Worf.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Stop!</p>
  <p> Worf turns to him, calm and curious, and stares at him<br>
    for a beat. Then he realizes Toq thinks he was trying<br>
    to get away.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless was condemned to die by<br>
    the tyrant Molor, who was angered<br>
    that Kahless had incited the<br>
    people against him. The night<br>
    before his execution, Kahless<br>
    asked that he be allowed to go out<br>
    into the night and say farewell to<br>
    the moon and the stars... for he<br>
    knew that in the netherworld, he<br>
    would not see them again.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Toq.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Kahless gave his word that he<br>
    would come back, and Molor let him<br>
    go.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    That was foolish.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The next day at dawn, Kahless<br>
    returned... and was put to death.</p>
  <p> Toq is amazed by the story.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    He could have saved himself.</p>

  <p>45 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He had given his word. Molor<br>
    understood what that meant. Just<br>
    as L'Kor did.</p>
  <p> Toq understands, looks down, almost ashamed to have<br>
    doubted Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> He leads Toq away.</p>
  <p>46 ANGLE - THE SUN</p>
  <p> to indicate the passage of time.</p>
  <p>47 EXT. JUNGLE - DAY</p>
  <p> as Worf and Toq move with great stealth into a small<br>
    clearing. All their attention is focused on the brush<br>
    ahead of them, as if their quarry were just beyond it.</p>
  <p> Worf stops moving and sniffs the air. They speak in<br>
    whispers.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    He is there. But the wind has<br>
    shifted. We must wait.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Why? We're so close.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Never approach your prey from<br>
    upwind; the breeze will carry your<br>
    scent.</p>
  <p> Toq nods that he understands. Worf catches the scent<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The wind is shifting again.</p>
  <p> Toq tries to catch the scent as well. He doesn't, and<br>
    gets frustrated.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I don't smell anything.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p>47 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He is there.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    How can you --</p>
  <p> Toq stops in mid-sentence as he catches the scent for<br>
    the first time. He's amazed at this seemingly new<br>
    ability.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Yes... I can smell it.</p>
  <p> Worf nods approvingly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Remember the scent. More than<br>
    anything else, it will guide you.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    It's strong. I can't believe I<br>
    couldn't smell it before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Let it work its way into your<br>
    blood.</p>
  <p> Toq feels himself being swept up in the moment.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I can feel my heart pounding.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. This is the moment where<br>
    life and death meet.</p>
  <p> Toq looks at Worf, his eyes shining.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    This is who we are. Warriors.</p>
  <p> Toq looks at Worf, grateful for what he has shared.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I was never taught that...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is much you were never<br>
    taught.</p>
  <p> There is a sudden rustling in the brush, and Worf's<br>
    senses quicken. He gestures for silence, then moves<br>
    forward. Toq stares after him for a beat, struck by<br>
    what Worf has said.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>48 INT. MEETING HALL (NIGHT)</p>
  <p> Where the Klingons and Romulans have gathered to eat.<br>
    Tokath sits with the Klingon Elders at the head of the<br>
    table, Gi'ral and Ba'el sit nearby. Over the years,<br>
    the Klingons have learned to eat with less<br>
    boisterousness than is typical.</p>
  <p> Tokath is eating with relish, but L'Kor is picking at<br>
    his food; he is concerned about Worf and Toq's<br>
    continued absence. Tokath realizes this.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Or are you upset because your<br>
    prisoner hasn't returned?</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    I should not have sent the boy<br>
    with him. If he's been hurt --</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Don't worry, my friend. They'll<br>
    be back... after all, a warrior<br>
    keeps his word. Isn't that so?</p>
  <p> The sarcasm is so mild as to go unnoticed, but L'Kor<br>
    notices. He stirs his food some more. Ba'el regards<br>
    the two men... decides to ask a risky question.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Father... if I wanted to visit<br>
    Romulus, or the Klingon Home world --<br>
    would I be allowed to go?</p>
  <p> A silence falls over the table. Tokath and Gi'ral<br>
    exchange a look.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Worf and Toq burst into the room. Toq has<br>
    the skinned CARCASS of a dead animal slung over his<br>
    shoulder. He smiles broadly at the stunned diners.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Ka'la!</p>
  <p> He swings the carcass off his shoulder and slaps it<br>
    onto the center of the table.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Tonight we eat well.</p>
  <p> Tokath stands, his voice icy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Get that off my table.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to see how Toq will react. He looks at<br>
    Tokath, his face unreadable.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    You do not kill an animal unless<br>
    you intend to eat it.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Get rid of it.</p>
  <p> Toq and Tokath face off.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I intend to, Tokath.</p>
  <p> He looks around the room.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    But not until it's cooked.</p>
  <p> He breaks into a broad smile. Several of the older<br>
    Klingons recognize this very Klingon brand of humor and<br>
    break into a hearty, table pounding laugh.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Today I learned the ritual hunt.<br>
    But that is not all I learned. I<br>
    discovered that warrior's blood<br>
    runs in my veins.</p>
  <p> He looks over the assembled group, who watch him,<br>
    riveted.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I do not know how or why, but we<br>
    have forgotten ourselves. Our<br>
    stories are not told, our songs<br>
    are not sung.<br>
    (gesturing to Worf)<br>
    Tonight as we came home, we sang<br>
    a song of victory -- a song known<br>
    to me only as a lullaby. But it<br>
    is a warrior's song.</p>
  <p> He speaks the first two lines.</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Bagh Da tuHmoh... fire streaks the<br>
    heavens. ChojaH Duh rHo... battle<br>
    has begun.</p>
  <p> He repeats them, this time pounding out an accompanying<br>
    beat on the table with his fist.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Bagh Da tuHmoh. ChojaH Duh rHo.<br>
    ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo' ylja'Qo</p>
  <p> As he moves into the second stanza, Worf and a few<br>
    others begin to pound out the same rhythm.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    van'aj javDIch Qong DIr Sa'VIch<br>
    ghIH yot quelI'Pa qevas HoH Qa</p>
  <p> As voices around the room begin to join in, the lullaby<br>
    we've heard before becomes a rousing marching song, a<br>
    song of battle intended to quicken the blood. Tokath<br>
    and L'Kor share a look of concern. The Romulan looks<br>
    over at his daughter and sees that she too has joined<br>
    in.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Ba'el!</p>
  <p> But she doesn't hear.</p>
  <p> THE GROUP<br>
    teblaw'nghu mughato'Du ylja'Qo<br>
    ylja'Qo! ylja'Qo!!</p>
  <p> They begin to repeat it a second time. Tokath looks<br>
    over to L'Kor and is disturbed to see that he is<br>
    absently mouthing along, without even realizing it.</p>
  <p> He looks to Gi'Ral for support, and though she is not<br>
    singing, he sees that her eyes are shining, that she is<br>
    moved by the words.</p>
  <p> Worf and Toq stand at the end of the table, leading the<br>
    song. Tokath's eyes catch Worf's and their gazes lock.<br>
    Tokath's look carries a warning: stop this or face the<br>
    consequences. But Worf continues to lead the song.</p>
  <p> We go out on the rousing chords of the song, and Worf's<br>
    defiant look as he leads this Klingon rebellion.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>49 INT. MEETING HALL</p>
  <p> Later. The room has been cleared; only Worf and Tokath<br>
    remain, facing off. Tokath regards Worf solemnly for<br>
    a beat, then paces away from him, musing, troubled.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Well, Worf... you've had quite an<br>
    effect on the young people.</p>
  <p> Worf's eyes bore into Tokath. He senses this is the<br>
    ultimate confrontation between the two.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have done nothing more than show<br>
    them what they are.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    No. You have shown them what you<br>
    want them to be.</p>
  <p> Tokath moves close to Worf.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Tell me this: do you know of any<br>
    place, any time in history that<br>
    Klingons and Romulans have lived<br>
    together in peace?</p>
  <p> Worf is silent; he has no answer.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    We have despised each other...<br>
    fought each other... for<br>
    centuries.</p>
  <p> He pauses, eyeing Worf.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Except here. On this remote<br>
    planet... Romulans and Klingons<br>
    live together in harmony.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No government, no leader, has ever<br>
    done what I have done here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/06/93 - ACT FIVE 45.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is a worthy achievement to<br>
    bring peace between enemies.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But the cost of that peace may be<br>
    too high.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Higher than endless war?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The people here have lost the<br>
    sense of who they are. They have<br>
    lost their heritage.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    In what way? A few stories not<br>
    told... a few songs not sung...<br>
    not a great loss, when compared to<br>
    our living in peace.</p>
  <p> Tokath's argument is logical, intellectual. But Worf's<br>
    perspective is something deeply, passionately felt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Those are our rituals... they<br>
    define us. They tell us what we<br>
    came from... what our children<br>
    will grow to be. Without<br>
    traditions, we have no identity --<br>
    we have no pride.</p>
  <p> Tokath makes a scoffing sound.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Klingon pride. Is it really so<br>
    valuable? Or is it just a tired<br>
    habit...</p>
  <p> Worf moves toward Tokath, eyes burning.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Today Toq went with me on the<br>
    ritual hunt... I saw what happened<br>
    to him when he caught the scent of<br>
    his prey on the wind... for the<br>
    first time in his life, he felt<br>
    powerful... that's what he has<br>
    been denied by living here...<br>
    that's what you have tried to take<br>
    away from him.<br>

  <p>49 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For you, perhaps that is enough.<br>
    The young people may want more.</p>
  <p> Tokath turns on him, intensity rising in him.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    More? What more is there than<br>
    what they have here? Would you<br>
    really suggest they go into a<br>
    universe where some would hate<br>
    them -- simply because of who they<br>
    are? Those traditions and rituals<br>
    you cherish so much would not<br>
    allow them to remain friends with<br>
    Romulans.</p>
  <p> Tokath moves closer, eyes locked on Worf.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Enough of this. We could talk all<br>
    night and not convince the other.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I offer you a choice. Live with<br>
    us... as one of us...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Or?</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Or I will have you put to death.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then that is what you will have to<br>
    do.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Worf, consider this carefully --</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That death will be honorable. The<br>
    young people will see what it is<br>
    to die as a Klingon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FIVE 46.</p>
  <p>49 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Tokath looks at Worf... sees the resolve in his eyes...<br>
    and knows he has no choice.</p>
  <p>50 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS (NIGHT)</p>
  <p> Worf is alone, doing the forms of the Mok'bara...<br>
    preparing to meet death.</p>
  <p> There is a KNOCK at the door.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> The door opens and a Romulan guard lets Ba'el in.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    (to guard)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> The guard EXITS, and Worf and Ba'el face each other for<br>
    a silent beat. Then, she withdraws the HYPO device<br>
    they used to implant the tracking pellet.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    I will remove the tracking device.<br>
    You can go over the wall and hide<br>
    in the jungle.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him, but he catches her wrist and<br>
    stops her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Why are you doing this?</p>
  <p> She hesitates, not meeting his eye. Then --</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    My father is wrong.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No matter how I might feel about<br>
    you, you don't deserve to die.</p>
  <p> He holds her wrist until she looks up at him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not going to run away, Ba'el.</p>
  <p> She stares at him in disbelief.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    They will kill you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/06/93 - ACT FIVE 47.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes. But they will not defeat me.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    I don't understand you.</p>
  <p> He drops her wrist, gathers his thoughts.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A Klingon does not run from his<br>
    battles.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Is that really the lesson you want<br>
    us to learn?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You've taught us a great deal...<br>
    awakened something in us that we<br>
    didn't know existed...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I don't understand what we can<br>
    learn from your death.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then you don't yet understand what<br>
    it is to be Klingon.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him... mind grappling with ideas and<br>
    issues she's never encountered in her sheltered<br>
    existence... but sensing one small core of truth in the<br>
    confusion.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Worf... in spite of everything<br>
    that's happened, I sense that you<br>
    still care for me. Am I wrong?</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates. This is a difficult issue for him to<br>
    confront -- the one about which he is most conflicted.<br>
    He is silent. She moves closer.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    It's so easy for you to talk of<br>
    being a warrior... of honor and<br>
    death... is it so hard to speak of<br>
    love?</p>
  <p> He turns away from her. She lifts a hand to his<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Worf... please...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/06/93 - ACT FIVE 47A.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> He finally turns to her, speaks with great difficulty.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I... would not have thought it<br>
    possible to love a Romulan...</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    But you do... ?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> She throws her arms around him.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    If you have come that far... can't<br>
    you take the next step? Can't you<br>
    stay here with us... with me?</p>
  <p> A torturous question; Worf agonizes. There is no right<br>
    answer.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    If there were a way... I would<br>
    take you with me...</p>
  <p> She smiles wanly at him.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    If there's anything I've learned<br>
    from you... from your reaction to<br>
    me... it's that I have no place<br>
    out there. Other Klingons won't<br>
    accept me for what I am.</p>
  <p> Worf stares at her; she has clarified the issue.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    And if I stay here... these<br>
    Klingons will not accept me for<br>
    what I am.</p>
  <p> Impasse. Ba'el turns away, anguish bringing her to<br>
    anger.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Why did you come here? We were<br>
    happy... we didn't know there was<br>
    anything missing from our lives...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Ba'el...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FIVE 47B.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> She turns suddenly and rushes impetuously into his<br>
    arms. She kisses him ardently and he holds her<br>
    tightly. Then she pulls away.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Good-bye, Worf.</p>
  <p> And she runs from the room.</p>
  <p>51 EXT. COMPOUND (DAY)</p>
  <p> Everyone in the camp is gathered in the central square.<br>
    They wait, talking quietly among themselves.</p>
  <p> Worf is brought from his quarters by two Romulans.<br>
    When he emerges, the crowd falls silent. This is not<br>
    a bloodthirsty mob, but a group of people doing what<br>
    they believe is best for the community, whatever their<br>
    personal feelings might be for the condemned man.</p>
  <p> As he is led toward the compound wall, Worf is brought<br>
    past Tokath and the Elders. The Romulan's face is<br>
    steely, but L'Kor can't meet Worf's eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As Worf passes Ba'el, their eyes meet and he sees that<br>
    hers are full of tears.</p>
  <p> The Romulans stand Worf against the compound wall and<br>
    move back toward the crowd, which stands away at some<br>
    distance in a semi-circle.</p>
  <p> Worf stands tall; there is no fear in his eyes. Tokath<br>
    steps forward and speaks in a voice loud enough for all<br>
    to hear, trying to head off the possibility that Worf<br>
    be seen as a martyr.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I know there are those among you<br>
    who may question what I'm about to<br>
    do. And you would not be wrong to<br>
    do so.</p>
  <p> He walks slowly among the crowd, addressing them as<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I have questioned myself... I have<br>
    spent the night considering my<br>
    decision, challenging myself to<br>
    justify whether it is right.</p>
  <p> He hesitates, eyes sweeping the group.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    And I have reached the conclusion<br>
    that it is absolutely necessary to<br>
    put this man to death.</p>
  <p> He moves closer to the group of people. They listen<br>
    intently.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    We have all shared an<br>
    extraordinary passage... from<br>
    being enemies... to becoming a<br>
    family.</p>
  <p> He approaches a Klingon woman, puts his hand on her<br>
    shoulder.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Turla, you were midwife when my<br>
    daughter was born... she might<br>
    have died if it had not been for<br>
    you.</p>

  <p>51 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> He moves to a Romulan man who holds his arm in an<br>
    awkward position.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Sentith... you wrestled with a<br>
    wild morag... to save a Klingon<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> He moves to a Klingon man.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I stood at your side when you<br>
    married, Ba'ktor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And wept with you when she fell<br>
    ill and died.</p>
  <p> He gestures around the crowd.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Every one of you could tell<br>
    similar stories... of things we<br>
    have shared... in love and in<br>
    sorrow.</p>
  <p> He walks back toward Worf.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    What we have built together...<br>
    would be destroyed by this man.<br>
    And I cannot let that happen.<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    I give you one last chance to<br>
    accept our way of life.</p>
  <p> Worf stares fiercely at him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Your words are eloquent, Tokath.<br>
    But the truth is that I am being<br>
    executed because I brought<br>
    something dangerous to your young<br>
    people: knowledge.</p>
  <p> He pauses to let this sink in.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Knowledge of their origins.<br>
    Knowledge of the real reasons you<br>
    are here in this camp. The truth<br>
    is a threat to you...</p>

    Enough.<br>
    (to the Romulans)<br>
    Stand ready.</p>
  <p> The guards unholster their disruptors. Ba'el looks at<br>
    Tokath, stricken, devastated.</p>
  <p> BA'EL<br>
    Father... please...</p>
  <p> But Tokath ignores her plea.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Raise your weapons.</p>
  <p> They do. Suddenly a VOICE rings out from across the<br>
    compound.</p>
  <p> TOQ (O.S.)<br>
    Ki'tow! (Stop!)</p>
  <p>52 TOQ</p>
  <p> as he emerges from a barrack dressed in full battle<br>
    regalia. He is wearing the armor from the chest that<br>
    Ba'el showed Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/06/93 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>53 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Toq starts over to where Worf is standing against the<br>
    wall. Tokath eyes him with barely controlled rage.<br>
    Toq speaks out in a loud, clear voice.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    If you kill him... you will have<br>
    to kill me, too.</p>
  <p> He stands next to Worf.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Step aside, Toq.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    Worf would rather die than accept<br>
    this way of life.</p>
  <p> Toq fixes his eyes on Tokath's.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    And so would I.</p>
  <p> There is an uncomfortable silence.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    I want to leave... as do many<br>
    others. You will have to kill us<br>
    to keep us here.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You see, Tokath? It's already too<br>
    late.</p>
  <p> Tokath reacts to this... he feels it even more<br>
    necessary to maintain his position and go through with<br>
    the execution.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    I am warning you -- move aside<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> But Toq stands there defiantly. Tokath knows that if<br>
    he backs down on this, he's lost. He turns to the<br>
    Romulans.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Stand ready.</p>
  <p> The Romulans turn toward Worf and Toq. L'Kor looks at<br>
    Tokath and sees the determination in his eyes. He<br>
    turns and pleads to Toq.</p>
  <p> L'KOR<br>
    Toq. Move away...</p>
  <p> But Toq just stands there. L'Kor turns to Worf, hoping<br>
    to appeal to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>

    He will listen to you. Tell<br>
    him...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    He has the right to make his<br>
    choice.</p>
  <p> L'Kor looks to Tokath, his eyes beseeching. But Tokath<br>
    is determined.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Raise your weapons.</p>
  <p> The Romulans raise their weapons.</p>
  <p> TOKATH<br>
    Take aim --</p>
  <p> But suddenly L'Kor moves forward and stands in front of<br>
    Toq. Before Tokath can reply, another Klingon moves in<br>
    to stand next to L'Kor. And one by one, the people<br>
    make their choice, moving to take their place in front<br>
    of Worf and Toq. Tokath is shaken... and outraged.</p>

    Tokath... long ago, when your<br>
    captives asked to stay here... we<br>
    hoped not to dishonor our children<br>
    on the Home World. But perhaps,<br>
    over the years, we lost sight of<br>
    the children we raised here.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    This is our prison. It should not<br>

  <p>53 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> There is a long beat. Then Tokath turns to Worf and,<br>
    almost imperceptibly, nods. Worf turns to the young<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Years ago, your parents made a<br>
    great sacrifice for the sake of<br>
    their families. Today they do so<br>
    again. For that, we must honor<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> A few murmurs of appreciation.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You must promise them -- that you<br>
    will never reveal their secret.<br>
    No one must know of this place.</p>
  <p> Parents and young people talk.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/13/93 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Toq hurries to Worf.</p>
  <p> TOQ<br>
    There's a supply ship due in a few<br>
    days. They will take us...</p>
  <p> Toq rattles on, but Worf's attention is focused on --</p>
  <p>53A BA'EL</p>
  <p> who stands at a distance, her parents on either side of<br>
    her, staring at Worf. Their eyes lock together.</p>
  <p> TOQ'S VOICE<br>
    When they arrive, Tokath will<br>
    explain to them. We'll be able to<br>
    start a new life...</p>
  <p> The sounds of the camp fade... and then Ba'el looks<br>
    down, turns and walks away. Her mother and father<br>
    follow her.</p>
  <p>54 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it travels at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46581.5.<br>
    We have scanned the planets of the<br>
    Nequencia system and found no<br>
    evidence of a Romulan prison camp.<br>
    We are now enroute to the Carraya<br>
    system, closer to Romulan space.</p>
  <p>55 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data and various N.D's. Data responds<br>
    to something on his monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, we are receiving a<br>
    subspace message. It is a Romulan<br>
    signal, text only.<br>

  <p>55 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    It is from Lieutenant Worf. He is<br>
    aboard a Romulan scout ship.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and moves toward him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He is requesting a rendezvous.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Input the coordinates and change<br>
    course.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to Riker and they share a smile of<br>
    relief.</p>
  <p>56 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL) (STOCK)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space near a Romulan scout ship.</p>
  <p>57 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, BEVERLY and a Transporter Chief are at the<br>
    control console. A group of young Klingons is being<br>
    led out the door by an N.D.. We HEAR the sound of<br>
    materialization.</p>
  <p>58 ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER PAD</p>
  <p> where Worf, Toq, and two young Klingons are on the<br>
    platform. Beverly scans them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They seem fine. We'll be giving<br>
    them all thorough checkups in<br>
    Sickbay.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Worf steps off and moves toward Picard; Beverly takes<br>
    the others out.</p>
  <p>59 BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p> Picard regards Worf, a smile on his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome home, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - 12/22/92 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Picard to Bridge. Signal the<br>
    Romulan ship that we have the last<br>
    group on board.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Birthright, Pt. II&quot; - REV. 01/05/93 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> There is an awkward moment of silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see you found what you were<br>
    looking for, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir. There was no prison<br>
    camp.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, hearing a tone in Worf's voice. Worf<br>
    takes a breath.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Those young people are<br>
    survivors... of a vessel that<br>
    crashed in the Carraya system four<br>
    years ago.</p>
  <p> Worf looks Picard right in the eye.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No one survived Khitomer.</p>
  <p> Picard knows full well what Worf is saying. They hold<br>
    a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> He gestures toward the door, and the two men start<br>
    toward it.</p>
  <p>60 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
