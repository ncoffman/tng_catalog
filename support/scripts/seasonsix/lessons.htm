    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> It is the night watch -- DATA sits in the command<br>
    chair; N.D.'s man the various vital stations. PICARD<br>
    ENTERS from the Turbolift, preoccupied with the PADD in<br>
    his hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good evening, Mister Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually, good morning, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles slightly as he realizes Data's right.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ship status is --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No need to report. I'm just here<br>
    to do some work of my own.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Entering information on his PADD, Picard heads to his<br>
    Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'd like to talk to Doctor Mowray<br>
    at his archaeological site on<br>
    Landris Two. Please put it<br>
    through to my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sorry, sir, but Stellar<br>
    Cartography has requested a<br>
    communications blackout while they<br>
    run an experiment.</p>
  <p> Picard is a little surprised to hear this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long will it be?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Another three hours, twenty-two<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns slightly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I can override it if necessary.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, no... it's not important.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS to...</p>
  <p>2 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard sits at his desk and puts down the PADD. After<br>
    a beat, he activates his DESKTOP TERMINAL.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, display the latest<br>
    excavation schematics from Landris<br>
    Two.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Library computer is temporarily<br>
    off-line.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Explain.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Library Systems have been<br>
    allocated to Stellar Cartography.</p>
  <p> Picard frowns at this unusual circumstance.</p>
  <p> He turns off his terminal and looks around the room.<br>
    His eyes settle on a BOOK and he decides to do some<br>
    reading. He stands and crosses to the REPLICATOR slot<br>
    in the wall.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tea, Earl Grey. Hot.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Replicator systems are off-line at<br>
    the request of --</p>
  <p> Picard finishes the sentence along with the computer.</p>
  <p> PICARD/COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Stellar Cartography...</p>
  <p> Picard is annoyed but not angry, reasoning that they<br>
    must be up to something important.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    What could they possibly be doing<br>
    down there... ?</p>
  <p> Picard's mouth was set for the tea, but curiosity gets<br>
    the better of him. He heads for the door.</p>
  <p>3 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard approaches the door to the Stellar Sciences<br>
    Department. He EXITS to...</p>
  <p>4 INT. CARTOGRAPHY LAB</p>
  <p> The room is pitch black, lit only by the light from the<br>
    corridor as Picard ENTERS. Startled by the sudden<br>
    blackness, he stops short in the open doorway.</p>
  <p> WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
    In or out, but close that door.</p>
  <p> Picard steps in quickly, and the door slides shut. He<br>
    strains to adjust to the blackness as he ENTERS. With<br>
    a bang, Picard's leg bumps into a table, dumping<br>
    EQUIPMENT noisily to the floor.</p>
  <p> WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
    Just try to stand still.</p>
  <p> In the shadows, several N.D.'s are hunched over a<br>
    console in the center of the room. It is a three-dimensional<br>
    grid, and its faint light bathes their<br>
    faces.</p>
  <p> Picard stands where he is.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The woman's voice carries a tone of frustration that is<br>
    slowly intensifying.</p>
  <p> WOMAN'S VOICE<br>
    It'll take a second for our eyes<br>
    to re-adjust...<br>
    (beat; urgent)<br>
    Elevate to three-point-two.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Good... we can do this...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We're losing vertical alignment.<br>
    Compensate...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Gently, don't bump it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No, no -- hit the...<br>
    (much louder)<br>
    Forget it. Lights.</p>
  <p> The group at the console breaks up. The owner of the<br>
    voice, NELLA DAREN, Lieutenant Commander, leans against<br>
    the console in frustration, her back to the door.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Whoever you are, you just ruined<br>
    four hours of work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You might've taken the simple<br>
    precaution of locking the door.</p>
  <p> She turns to lay into this cheeky interloper.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    It's three o'clock in the morning --</p>
  <p> Her face falls when she realizes it's the Captain.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Captain Picard...</p>
  <p> Picard can't help but smile at her discomfort.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must be Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Daren.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Yes, sir. I'm sorry. It's just<br>
    we weren't expecting many people<br>
    to be up at this hour.</p>
  <p> Picard gestures that there's no need to apologize.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're new aboard the Enterprise.<br>
    I think you'll soon learn to start<br>
    expecting the unexpected.</p>
  <p> She appreciates his letting the matter drop and smiles.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    That's why I put in for this<br>
    assignment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Excellent. Now perhaps you could<br>
    tell me what was so important that<br>
    it required depriving the ship's<br>
    Captain of a cup of Earl Grey?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Earl Grey? No wonder you can't<br>
    sleep.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts as she strides toward her replicator.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Computer, bring replicators back<br>
    on line and give me a cup of Daren<br>
    herbal tea blend number three,<br>
    hot.</p>
  <p> She turns back as we HEAR the replicator.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    You shouldn't be drinking a<br>
    stimulant at this time of night.<br>
    I think you'll like this.</p>
  <p> She hands him the tea which has appeared, looks on as<br>
    he takes a sip. He grimaces and makes a sour face at<br>
    the taste. Nella takes it in stride.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I've programmed seven other blends<br>
    into the replicator...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    You're bound to like one of them.</p>
  <p> Though still smarting from the taste, Picard tries to<br>
    be gracious.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I look forward to sampling them.</p>
  <p> Nella smiles, then moves toward the console where she<br>
    was working earlier.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'm sorry if the system blackouts<br>
    we requested inconvenienced you.<br>
    We were taking very precise<br>
    gravimetric readings -- it<br>
    wouldn't have taken much to throw<br>
    them off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (eyeing the console)<br>
    What are these readings for?</p>
  <p> Nella is pleased the Captain is taking an interest.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'm trying to construct a<br>
    mathematical model of an emerging<br>
    star system. If it works, we'll<br>
    be able to predict the<br>
    configuration of a system that<br>
    won't be formed for another two<br>
    million years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a wry smile)<br>
    That's a long time to wait to find<br>
    out if you're right.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I have a few things to do between<br>
    now and then.</p>
  <p> They regard each other... off their mutual intrigue<br>
    we...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it moves at warp.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER, Data and various N.D.s. Picard ENTERS from the<br>
    Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll arrive at the Borgolis<br>
    Nebula in three hours, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand it has unusual<br>
    radioactive emissions -- I'm sure<br>
    Stellar Sciences will find it an<br>
    interesting study.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander Daren has already<br>
    requested time on the main sensor<br>
    array.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and heads for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the Bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p> Data turns to address him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I would like to remind<br>
    you about our concert this evening<br>
    in Ten-Forward.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We will be performing Chopin's<br>
    Trio in G minor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I'll be there.</p>
  <p> Data is gratified to hear this...</p>
  <p>7 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and BEVERLY are sharing an afternoon lunch,<br>
    chatting about this and that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... the upshot is... we'll be close<br>
    enough for you to slip away for a<br>
    few days and see Wesley.</p>
  <p> Beverly beams at hearing this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wonderful, thank you, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> She sips her tea.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This is delicious; what is it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's an herbal tea blend...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I came across it in the replicator<br>
    files.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have you met any of the new<br>
    crewmembers we took on at Starbase<br>
    Two-eighteen?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    In fact, I have a new Nurse. His<br>
    name's Beck, he's an obstetrics<br>
    specialist.</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/28/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (casually)<br>
    I met the new head of Stellar<br>
    Sciences last night. Lieutenant<br>
    Commander Daren.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... Nella Daren. She was in<br>
    Sickbay for a physical last week.<br>
    I liked her. Very forthright.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very.</p>
  <p> Beverly suddenly remembers something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh, I forgot to tell you... The<br>
    Exogenics Journal accepted my<br>
    paper for publication.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That's wonderful, Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm hoping to get a response from<br>
    other scientists studying<br>
    ribosomal replication. There's<br>
    still no satisfying explanation<br>
    for the genetic drift.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    That journal is widely read.<br>
    You'll probably be swamped with<br>
    responses.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Did you know it's possible now to<br>
    predict the configuration of a<br>
    star system that won't be formed<br>
    for another two million years?</p>
  <p> She stares at him, momentarily off-stride by this non-sequitur...<br>
    but Picard's interests are many and farranging.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Really? No, I didn't...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's quite intriguing. It's made<br>
    possible by a rather complex<br>
    mathematical construct based on<br>
    fractal particle motion. And of<br>
    course that's just the<br>
    foundation... the modeling itself<br>
    requires gravimetric wave inputs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> He hears her polite, neutral response and smiles self-effacingly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I'm sure it sounds dry.<br>
    Stellar cartography isn't<br>
    everyone's cup of tea...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure it's fascinating.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles and puts his cup down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... we'd better get to Ten<br>
    Forward; we don't want to be late<br>
    for the concert.</p>
  <p> And they rise to EXIT.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> TROI, GEORDI, Riker, Picard and Beverly are sitting<br>
    among the N.D.'s waiting for the performance to start.<br>
    People talk quietly among themselves as they wait.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A PIANO has been set up on one side of the room, along<br>
    with CHAIRS and MUSIC STANDS for the accompanists.</p>
  <p> The crowd falls silent as the musicians ENTER and take<br>
    their seats. Data carries his violin. Another<br>
    musician will play a cello. Everyone is in place<br>
    except the piano soloist, to whom Data now gestures so<br>
    they may ENTER.</p>
  <p> It is Nella Daren...</p>
  <p>9 CLOSE - PICARD</p>
  <p> as he recognizes her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>10 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> as Data gestures to the others and begins the concert.</p>
  <p> Nella dives into the piece with amazing skill and<br>
    relish. From the crash of opening chords to the<br>
    following arpeggiated run, her performance is an<br>
    explosion of passionate color. At once, the room is<br>
    electrified.</p>
  <p>11 CLOSE - PICARD</p>
  <p> as he listens to this virtuosic performance. He's<br>
    never heard music played more beautifully. His eyes<br>
    close as he takes it all in...</p>
  <p>12 ON CROWD</p>
  <p> as we see that Picard is not alone in feeling moved by<br>
    her playing.</p>
  <p>13 OMITTED</p>
  <p>14 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> during the reception following the performance. Nella<br>
    is surrounded by admirers and well-wishers.</p>
  <p> Data, Beverly and Picard stand nearby waiting their<br>
    turn to thank her for the performance. After a moment,<br>
    she turns to them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your playing was remarkable.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (without modesty)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're very talented.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I noticed that the applause<br>
    tonight exceeded average decibel<br>
    levels.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I guess that means they enjoyed<br>
    themselves. I know I enjoyed<br>
    playing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That was obvious.</p>
  <p> Data has been looking around for the other musician.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Excuse me. I have not yet<br>
    congratulated Ensign Cheney.</p>
  <p> Nella nods.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll go with you.</p>
  <p> Beverly exchanges smiles with Picard and moves after<br>
    Data.</p>
  <p> Picard and Nella are alone. Their eyes meet.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I played piano for a while when I<br>
    was young. But I never put in the<br>
    practice time it takes to become<br>
    truly proficient.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    That was never my problem. In<br>
    fact, my parents had to make me go<br>
    out and play.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles. Then... something he's been wondering<br>
    about...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wanted to ask you... during the<br>
    second arpeggio in the first<br>
    movement, I noticed you played an<br>
    F minor chord instead of a<br>
    diminished D.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    You're a musician. What's your<br>
    instrument? We should play some<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm very much an amateur. But I<br>
    must say, your choice in that<br>
    arpeggio was delightful. Not at<br>
    all what one expects to hear.</p>

  <p> She regards him evenly... with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Well, Captain... now that I'm on<br>
    your ship, maybe you should start<br>
    expecting the unexpected.</p>
  <p> She smiles... and Picard, hearing his own words echoed<br>
    back to him, can't help but smile back. Hold on their<br>
    look for a beat --</p>

  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space in the vicinity of the blue-tinged<br>
    Borgolis Nebula.</p>
  <p>17 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and various N.D.'s. Nella ENTERS from the<br>
    Turbolift and approaches Riker.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Excuse me, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker nods that she go ahead.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I was hoping my people in Spectral<br>
    Analysis could have another few<br>
    hours on the main sensor array.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry, the array's been<br>
    allocated to Engineering; they're<br>
    running some warp field tests.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    If we go off-line now, we'll lose<br>
    the gas flow pattern we've been<br>
    tracking.</p>
  <p> Riker's not annoyed by any of this -- he's used to<br>
    advocacy from Department heads and is comfortable<br>
    making these kinds of decisions.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I understand that. But we've got<br>
    other departments waiting to use<br>
    the array.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    We're at a critical juncture --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 16.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Nella backs off. Though Riker won't be pushed, he is<br>
    willing to be flexible.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll see what I can do about more<br>
    time tomorrow.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Tomorrow... but ---<br>
    (beat; she realizes this<br>
    is the best she can<br>
    get)<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker nods an acknowledgment and she EXITS to the<br>
    Turbolift.</p>
  <p>18 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> It's evening. Picard is holding his flute, listening<br>
    to a playback of a recording he just made. He is<br>
    dressed comfortably, a cup of tea on a nearby table.<br>
    The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    End playback.</p>
  <p> The Computer stops the recording.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS to REVEAL Nella standing in the doorway.<br>
    Under her arm is some sort of rolled-up SCROLL.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Commander Daren.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I hope you don't mind me dropping<br>
    by like this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm delighted. Come in.</p>
  <p> She comes in and the door closes behind her. She sees<br>
    the flute in his hand.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    What kind of flute is that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's Ressikan.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I never saw one before.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They're not made anymore.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    How long have you been playing?</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't quite know how to explain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A long time...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'd love to hear you play<br>
    sometime.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not very good.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    It doesn't matter, as long as you<br>
    enjoy it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, but I wouldn't want to<br>
    inflict it on anyone else.</p>
  <p> She shrugs.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    May I try?</p>
  <p> Picard hands her the instrument. She eyes it briefly,<br>
    sets her fingers to the holes, and tries it. The notes<br>
    are off key and flat. She stops and inspects it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're not holding it quite<br>
    right...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Show me.</p>
  <p> Picard takes the flute and PLAYS a few notes, simple<br>
    and sweet. Nella is pleased by the sound. When he<br>
    finishes he shrugs as if it were nothing.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    You're better than you think.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    Please...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Really. We should play together.</p>
  <p> This isn't what Picard was hoping to hear.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's... no piano here.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Oh, but there is.</p>
  <p> Nella takes the scroll she brought in and unfurls it on<br>
    a nearby table. It's a sheet of piano keys that<br>
    flatten out to become a keyboard. She turns and sees<br>
    the expression of surprise on Picard's face.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I picked it up on Mataline Two.<br>
    It's amazing.</p>
  <p> She does a little ARPEGGIO to show off. It sounds like<br>
    a good electronic keyboard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Remarkable...<br>
    (hoping to get out of<br>
    this)<br>
    Why don't you play something for<br>
    me?</p>
  <p> She eyes him, knowing what he's up to.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    You start... I'll jump in.</p>
  <p> Picard can't think how to get out of it. He sets his<br>
    fingers on the flute tentatively.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What... shall we play?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    What were you working on before I<br>
    came in?</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Bach... the third Brandenburg.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Perfect. Go ahead.</p>
  <p> He gamely starts in; she waits a few beats and then<br>
    joins in. The moment she does, he is thrown off, and<br>
    stops.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    It's all right... you're not used<br>
    to playing with anyone, are you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just the computer.</p>
  <p> She eyes him, suddenly feeling the plight of this man,<br>
    sitting alone in his room, playing music with a<br>
    computer.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Well... I may not be as precise as<br>
    a computer... but I think you'll<br>
    enjoy it more.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> NELLA (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's try something a little<br>
    simpler. How about...</p>
  <p> She begins playing &quot;Frere Jacque.&quot; He smiles and<br>
    chimes in at the appropriate place for the round. They<br>
    play it through once. He has played his part solidly<br>
    and she is pleased.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Very good! Now... let's have a<br>
    little fun with it.</p>
  <p> She plays a slight variation on the &quot;Frere Jacque&quot;<br>
    melody.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Try it. Improvise on the melody --<br>
    anything you want.</p>
  <p> He takes a breath... starts to play... it's like a<br>
    beginner's improvisation, not very loose or imaginative --<br>
    but it's a beginning.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    That's wonderful! Keep going...</p>
  <p> He does, and she joins in, noodling in and around his<br>
    playing. It's a delightful little counterpoint and it<br>
    helps to loosen him up. He becomes freer... takes a<br>
    few chances... she matches him... he launches into a<br>
    bold, venturesome direction and she starts laughing,<br>
    staying with him, feeling the joyousness that the<br>
    intermingling of music is bringing them both.</p>
  <p>19 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise hanging in space near the nebula.</p>
  <p>20 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Data, and various N.D.s. Riker nods that a PADD<br>
    an N.D. is showing him checks out fine, then moves to<br>
    sit in the command chair. After a moment, Picard<br>
    ENTERS from his Ready Room. He's full of energy and<br>
    seems to be in a great mood.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... my sparring partner<br>
    cancelled for this afternoon. I<br>
    was wondering if you wanted to<br>
    join me?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>20 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker is unsure -- the Captain is far better than he<br>
    is.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fencing, sir? I'm really not very<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> Picard dismisses this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It doesn't matter... as long as<br>
    you enjoy it.</p>
  <p> Riker considers, then smiles and nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    Excellent. Fourteen hundred<br>
    hours, then.</p>
  <p> He nods and returns to his Ready Room. Riker watches<br>
    him go, glad to see him in a good mood.</p>
  <p>21 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Nella is being examined by Beverly, who waves a SCANNER<br>
    over her right arm from elbow to wrist.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You have a mild strain.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I've been playing the piano a<br>
    lot... I guess the Captain and I<br>
    overdid it a little last night.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts to this, bemused.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The Captain?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    He plays a kind of flute...<br>
    Ressikan, I think he said.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes... but I didn't realize he<br>
    played... duets.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    He never did before. But he<br>
    seemed to enjoy it. He's actually<br>
    quite promising.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Tell me... have you known him<br>
    long?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. A long time...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    He seems... somewhat isolated.</p>
  <p> Beverly reflects on this.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd say he's a private person...<br>
    but not isolated.</p>
  <p> Nella takes this in. Beverly turns off the scanner<br>
    she's been using.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There. That should help.</p>
  <p> Nella flexes her wrist.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    It feels much better. Thank you.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> Nella hops off the biobed.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I was afraid I'd have to cancel.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Another duet?</p>
  <p> They share a look and Nella EXITS.</p>
  <p>22 INT. JEFFERIES TUBE</p>
  <p> Open on the rungs of the ladder. A woman's hand comes<br>
    into frame, then another. She's climbing up. Then<br>
    Nella's body passes. She carries a small BAG slung<br>
    over one shoulder, and is dressed in civilian clothes.</p>
  <p> PICARD (O.S.)<br>
    Where are we going?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Keep climbing.</p>
  <p> As Nella passes out of frame we see, emerging after her<br>
    on the ladder, the hands and face of Picard. He too is<br>
    in civilian clothes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't see why we can't just<br>
    practice in my quarters.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    We're almost there.</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE ON JEFFERIES TUBE INTERSECTION</p>
  <p> It is the intersection of a vertical and horizontal<br>
    tube. Nella climbs into the horizontal tube and scoots<br>
    over to make room for Picard.</p>
  <p> Sitting cross-legged on the floor, she reaches into her<br>
    bag and pulls out her SCROLL KEYBOARD, spreading it out<br>
    in front of her. After a moment, Picard emerges and<br>
    climbs into the tube with her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 24.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Do you know where we are?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (looking around)<br>
    The fourth intersect of Jefferies<br>
    Tube twenty-five.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    No... this is the most<br>
    acoustically perfect spot on the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> She starts to PLAY, and the sound fills the tube.<br>
    Picard hears that she's right and nods in appreciation.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    The intersection acts as a<br>
    resonance chamber.</p>
  <p> She continues to play as Picard speaks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did you find it?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    A little exploring.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't tell me you climbed through<br>
    every tube on the ship?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Well, not every one.<br>
    (indicating his bag)<br>
    Try it. See how it sounds.</p>
  <p> Picard takes his flute from her bag. He puts it to his<br>
    lips... and begins playing the melody from &quot;Inner<br>
    Light.&quot; It is lyrical, haunting... she is transfixed.<br>
    He stops, somewhat embarrassed by her rapt attention.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    That's beautiful. What is it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just an old folk melody.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I've never heard you play with<br>
    such feeling.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She begins picking out the melody on the keyboard...<br>
    then adding chords. He watches her, enjoying her<br>
    concentration... hearing the beautiful melody.</p>
  <p> She looks up and sees the look on his face.</p>
  <p> Their eyes lock for a long moment. He breaks it off,<br>
    and Nella looks down at her keyboard. After a few<br>
    notes, Picard joins in. We stay with them for a few<br>
    moments before cutting to:</p>
  <p>24 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi works alone at a CONSOLE. He hears something.<br>
    MUSIC? How can that be? He walks around the room<br>
    slowly. Where can it be coming from? Finally, he<br>
    leans into a Jefferies Tube and puts his head up the<br>
    shaft.</p>
  <p>25 ON DATA</p>
  <p> who ENTERS the room to see Geordi with his head<br>
    sticking up the tube. He's concerned.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi. Is there a problem?</p>
  <p> Geordi pulls his head out of the tube.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I hear music.</p>

  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Music?</p>
  <p> Geordi nods and moves away from the tube so that Data<br>
    can stick his head in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not hear anything.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Are you sure?</p>
  <p> Data nods. Geordi moves back toward the tube and leans<br>
    his head in.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    I know I heard something.</p>
  <p> He listens, then pulls his head out.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's stopped.</p>

  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>27 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> where we pick up Picard and Nella after they've left<br>
    the Jefferies Tube, still in civilian clothes. She is<br>
    holding the bag which contains her keyboard and<br>
    Picard's flute.</p>
  <p> There is a charge in the air between them.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    ... I'd heard about Kerelian<br>
    tenors all my life, but nothing<br>
    could've prepared me for that<br>
    man's voice. Soaring...<br>
    incredible range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm told there are nuances only<br>
    Kerelians can hear -- we don't<br>
    have the ears for it.</p>
  <p> The lift stops and an N.D. ENTERS. Picard's demeanor<br>
    changes slightly; he stops looking at Nella and stares<br>
    straight ahead.</p>
  <p> After a moment she looks up at him.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I should be finished with my<br>
    survey by eleven hundred hours.</p>
  <p> It is clear that she is asking when Picard will be<br>
    free, and when they can get together. As the lift<br>
    slows to a stop, Picard answers her as if she were<br>
    reporting to her commanding officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good, Commander.</p>
  <p> And he EXITS the Turbolift. Nella is left wondering if<br>
    he wouldn't rather just forget what happened between<br>
    them in the Jefferies Tube. Off her reaction...</p>
  <p>27A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard -- now in uniform -- Riker, Troi, Worf and<br>
    various N.D.'s. Geordi ENTERS from the Turbolift and<br>
    approaches Riker, who is at aft science with an N.D.</p>

    Commander, we've finished the warp<br>
    field test.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You brought it in ahead of<br>
    schedule.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No problem. We got modulation<br>

    (reads off his console)<br>
    The Federation Outpost on<br>
    Bersallis Three reports that they<br>

    storm activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is the outpost in any danger?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No, sir. The storm is heading for<br>
    the northern continent, which is<br>
    not populated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bersallin fire storms come in<br>
    seven year cycles -- this might be<br>
    a good chance to study them.</p>

    But I have to be concerned about<br>
    more than my own happiness.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And you think that perhaps your<br>
    feelings toward Nella could change<br>
    the way you function as Captain...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Relationships with coworkers<br>
    can be fraught with<br>
    consequences.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    That's true. But cutting yourself<br>
    off from your feelings can carry<br>
    consequences that are just as<br>
    important.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've always believed that becoming<br>
    involved with someone under my<br>

    And yet...</p>
  <p> He trails off.</p>

    Captain... are you asking my<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    If I were... would you give it?</p>
  <p> She considers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in, a mixture of relief and<br>

  <p> where Nella is working alone at a console. She's<br>
    engrossed in her work and doesn't look up at the SOUND<br>

    Come in.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS. When she doesn't turn around:</p>

  <p> She turns and sees him. Given what happened in the<br>
    Turbolift, she decides to keep it professional.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Can I help you, sir?</p>
  <p> Picard frowns when he hears her refer to him like this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sorry about what happened this<br>
    morning in the Turbolift.<br>
    (he tries to explain)<br>
    When that crewman walked in I<br>
    felt... self-conscious. It might<br>
    take me a while to get used to the<br>
    idea of the crew seeing us<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> Nella's face softens as she realizes why he did it.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I understand...</p>
  <p> She moves closer to him.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'm glad you told me. For a<br>
    minute there I thought I'd misread<br>
    you...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    One kiss and you're off to find<br>
    someone else.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at this...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I promise you... I'm not one for<br>
    casual relationships.</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a long moment... suddenly<br>
    one of Nella's colleagues ENTERS behind them, carrying<br>
    a PADD. The scientist nods at them distractedly, then<br>
    goes to work on a wall console.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's something I want to tell<br>
    you...</p>
  <p> Picard glances at the scientist.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you remember that folk melody<br>
    I played for you this morning?</p>
  <p> She nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I learned it on a planet called<br>
    Kataan.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Never heard of it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not surprised. Its sun went<br>
    nova over a thousand years ago.</p>
  <p> Nella looks confused.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise encountered a probe<br>
    sent from the planet before it was<br>
    destroyed. The probe scanned me --<br>
    I lost consciousness, and in the<br>
    space of twenty-five minutes... I<br>
    lived a lifetime there.</p>
  <p> Picard sits down next to her, takes her hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had a wife... children.</p>
  <p> Picard sees Nella struggling to get her mind around it<br>
    all.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It was all very real to me.</p>
  <p> She squeezes his hand. Picard looks at her.</p>

  <p> Nella is moved by his story...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Why are you telling me all this?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because I want you to understand<br>
    what my music means to me.<br>

    And what it means for me to be<br>
    able to share it with someone.</p>
  <p> She looks at him.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Her face is filled with emotion. They kiss... more<br>

  <p> Riker reacts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do you know that?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I offered it to him.</p>
  <p> Riker stops.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transfers have to be cleared<br>
    through me -- before an offer's<br>
    made.</p>
  <p> Nella realizes she made a mistake.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'm sorry. We were just talking<br>
    and --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's okay. But Fontana should<br>
    stay where he is.</p>
  <p> Riker is about to resume down the corridor.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (apologetic)<br>
    Commander, please... don't make<br>
    that decision final.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I realize I shouldn't have made<br>
    the offer, but he's perfect for<br>
    the job. And quantum mechanics is<br>
    over-staffed anyway.</p>
  <p> Riker looks at her.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander... do you realize the<br>
    position you're putting me in?</p>
  <p> She has no idea.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I think I'm just doing what any<br>
    good department head would do --<br>
    trying to build the best staff I<br>
    can.</p>
  <p> Riker realizes she doesn't see his problem. He frowns<br>
    slightly, makes a decision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Look... I'll review the situation<br>
    and let you know as soon as I can.</p>
  <p> He moves off, leaving Nella a little confused by his<br>
    attitude.</p>
  <p>35 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is reading at his desk. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Can I have a minute?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course. Come in.</p>
  <p> Riker approaches, clearly feeling uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's about Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Daren...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    As a department head, she comes to<br>
    me about systems allocation,<br>
    personnel transfers -- things like<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, sensing that Riker is telling him<br>
    something he already knows as a way of leading up to<br>
    something difficult.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 1/26/93 - ACT THREE 34A.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I have to say, I'm beginning to<br>
    feel... uncomfortable dealing with<br>
    her requests.</p>
  <p> Picard realizes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because of her relationship with<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One... are her requests<br>
    unusual?</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Would you say she's just trying to<br>
    do her job?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> This is what Picard was hoping to hear.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then let her.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And feel free to do yours.</p>
  <p> Picard tries to put him at ease.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ship's resources are your<br>
    responsibility. I've always had<br>
    complete confidence in your<br>
    judgment.</p>
  <p> Riker is glad to hear this from him. He smiles and<br>
    stands.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and Riker EXITS. Though Picard has dealt<br>
    with the situation, his face still registers concern.</p>

  <p>35A INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where Nella is in the middle of telling Picard a story<br>
    over dinner. The lights and incidental music give the<br>

  <p> NELLA<br>
    ... I can't believe I'm going to<br>
    get a chance to study the fire<br>
    storms on Bersallis. Did you know<br>
    they're generated by solar flare<br>
    activity? Apparently the<br>
    radiation --</p>
  <p> She stops when she senses his distraction.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'm boring you.</p>
  <p> Her smile is self-deprecating. Picard looks at her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's not that.</p>
  <p> She sees that he's got something serious on his mind.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Riker came to talk to me<br>
    this afternoon.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    About you.</p>
  <p> Nella reacts -- she'd been thinking about their<br>
    encounter herself.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    About the personnel transfer?</p>
  <p> He nods.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I thought he felt uncomfortable.<br>
    (hoping it's not true)<br>
    Did he think I was asking for<br>
    special treatment?</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>

  <p>35A CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I was just doing what I thought<br>
    was best for my department.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's what I told him. But we<br>
    have to be very careful.<br>
    Obviously it's easy for people to<br>
    misunderstand.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I don't like the thought of having<br>
    to second-guess people all the<br>
    time. If I have to worry about<br>
    what people are thinking about me,<br>
    I'll be concentrating on the wrong<br>
    thing. And I won't be as<br>
    effective an officer.</p>

  <p>35A CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All I'm saying is that it's<br>
    something we have to be aware of.<br>
    But don't compromise yourself, do<br>
    what you have to do.</p>
  <p> He catches her eye.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Because if I find out that the<br>
    head of Stellar Sciences isn't<br>
    effective anymore, I'll do what I<br>
    have to do...<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'll replace her.</p>
  <p> Nella smiles, the incident suddenly seems manageable<br>
    now that it's been brought out into the open.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Noted, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suggest we forget about this and<br>
    enjoy the evening.</p>
  <p> They raise their wine glasses and clink, eyeing each<br>
    other fondly.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    What about that dessert you<br>
    promised me?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, yes.<br>

    Three reports that the storm has<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46693.1.<br>
    We have entered the Bersallis star<br>
    system and are making preparations<br>
    to evacuate the Federation Outpost<br>
    on the third planet.</p>
  <p>37 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Beverly, Data, Geordi, Nella and an N.D.<br>
    colleague (Marquez) have assembled to discuss the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The fire storms can kick up winds<br>
    of over two hundred kilometers per<br>
    hour -- and temperatures as high<br>
    as three hundred degrees C.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Incredible... what causes them?</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    They form when solar flare<br>
    radiation from the Bersallin sun<br>
    reacts with high energy plasma<br>
    present in the planet's<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wasn't the outpost built to<br>
    withstand the conditions?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes; the structure is reinforced<br>
    and insulated. But this is no<br>
    ordinary storm; it's twice as big<br>
    as any they've ever had. The<br>
    outpost won't withstand it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT FOUR 38.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll be arriving a little over an<br>
    hour before the storm hits.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It'll take at least two hours to<br>
    transport all the colonists off<br>
    the surface.</p>
  <p> The direness of the situation is brought home to all<br>
    present. After a moment.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I led a team of geologists to<br>
    study the plasma geyser on Taurus<br>
    Four -- we cross-connected a few<br>
    thermal deflector units to create<br>
    a protective shield against the<br>
    heat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A fire wall...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Could something like that work<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> Geordi considers.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It might.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to the OKUDAGRAM on the wall monitor that<br>
    shows an overhead view of the outpost.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The storm is approaching the<br>
    outpost from this direction.<br>
    (he indicates)<br>
    If we set up a series of thermal<br>
    deflector units along the northern<br>
    perimeter, we could create a fire<br>
    wall to deflect some of the heat --<br>
    the outpost's insulation could<br>
    probably handle the rest.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thermal deflectors generate a<br>
    field approximately four hundred<br>
    meters wide. We would need to<br>
    cross-connect six units and align<br>
    them so their fields overlap.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT FOUR 38A.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How many people would it take to<br>
    set it up?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Twelve, two per team. Cross-connecting<br>
    that many units will be<br>
    tricky; once they're set up we'll<br>
    have to leave them in place and<br>
    transport our people out -- no one<br>
    could survive very long outside<br>
    the outpost.</p>
  <p> Riker looks to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's do it.</p>
  <p> Riker dives right into it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The storm's going to interfere<br>
    with communications --<br>
    everything'll have to be<br>
    coordinated from the surface.</p>
  <p> Everyone nods that they understand the risks involved.</p>

  <p>37 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Mister Data, you'll coordinate the<br>
    evacuation of the colonists.<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Doctor, they have nine patients in<br>
    the outpost infirmary. Your<br>
    priority will be getting them to<br>
    Sickbay -- after that you'll stay<br>
    aboard the Enterprise and be ready<br>
    to receive casualties.<br>
    (to N.D. officer)<br>
    Marquez, you'll take some people<br>
    down to track the storm -- you'll<br>
    need to keep all teams apprised of<br>
    its heading.<br>
    (to Nella)<br>
    Commander, you'll coordinate the<br>
    deployment of the deflectors.</p>
  <p> Picard stiffens slightly when he hears this. Riker<br>
    turns to the assembled faces.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's go.</p>
  <p> He stands and the meeting breaks up. Picard stays<br>
    seated, his eyes on the Okudagram on the wall. When<br>
    nearly everyone's gone, he asks Nella to stay in an<br>
    even tone.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Daren... ?</p>
  <p> She turns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    About these thermal deflectors...</p>
  <p> He stands and moves toward the Okudagram. By the time<br>
    he's there, everyone else is gone.</p>

  <p>37 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    It seems to me that any one of a<br>
    number of people could coordinate<br>
    their deployment.</p>
  <p> Given their discussion, Nella is a little surprised to<br>
    hear him say this.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I assume Commander Riker chose me<br>
    because I'm the best person for<br>
    the job.</p>
  <p> Picard can't deny it. Nella takes his hand, moved by<br>
    his concern for her.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Didn't we agree not to let our<br>
    relationship get in the way of our<br>
    work?</p>
  <p> Picard lets out a breath, nods. But he still doesn't<br>
    like it.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'll be all right.</p>
  <p> She smiles to reassure him. Out on his look...</p>

  <p> ON THE MOVE with Riker and Picard as they discuss final<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Lieutenant Marquez is already set<br>

  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> They EXIT to...</p>

  <p> The Transporter pad is filled with N.D. team members<br>
    awaiting transport. Nella is among them, loaded with<br>
    equipment. As Picard and Riker ENTER, the first<br>
    officer heads onto the pad to take his place.</p>
  <p> Picard nods slightly to Riker, but his eyes fix on<br>
    Nella's, speaking volumes.</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>41 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Bersallis Three. The dark red area of<br>
    firestorm activity has now grown significantly larger,<br>
    engulfing as large an area as a hurricane would on<br>
    Earth.</p>
  <p>42 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is in the command chair; all stations are<br>
    manned. There is an undercurrent of shared concern for<br>
    those who face the real danger -- the colonists and<br>
    members of the crew on the planet.</p>
  <p> WORF, dividing his time between Tactical and Mission<br>
    Ops, is assisted by an N.D. stationed at Mission Ops.</p>
  <p> Picard's manner is intense and fast-paced, but not<br>
    harried.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long before the storm reaches<br>
    the outpost?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Seventeen minutes.</p>
  <p> A growing concern for his crew registers on Picard's<br>
    face.</p>

    circuitry on the far side of the room. An N.D. is<br>
    working the transporter controls.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The ionization from the storm is<br>

    Keep at it, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p>44 NEW ANGLE</p>

    surface.</p>
  <p>45 EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two N.D. crewmembers, Richardson and Deng, are working<br>
    near a rock face; each is setting up a DEFLECTOR UNIT.<br>
    The units are cylindrical, and have a tripod base; they<br>
    are capped by an emitter array, which lights up when<br>
    the unit is activated.</p>
  <p> Nella ENTERS the scene to check on their progress,<br>
    having just come from an area where another team was<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> She opens her TRICORDER and begins to scan the area<br>

  <p> The N.D.'s activate their units remotely, using PADD-like<br>
    devices. The units pulse to life, throwing up a<br>

    a moment.</p>
  <p> NELLA holds up her tricorder and scans.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>

  <p>47 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Not the one Geordi was in; a different N.D. is manning<br>
    the controls. Beverly has come aboard with some<br>
    infirmary patients, who are being led away by N.D.<br>
    personnel.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've just brought aboard the last<br>
    of the infirmary patients and<br>
    they're on their way to Sickbay.<br>
    But we still have over a hundred<br>
    colonists down there.</p>
  <p>48 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood, Doctor.</p>
  <p> The concern on Picard's face is evident. The Bridge is<br>
    monitoring surface transmissions -- the static in them<br>
    only serves to heighten the sense of danger.</p>

    the deflectors cross-connected.<br>
    The only way this is going to work<br>

  <p> NELLA looks at her team members.</p>
  <p>50 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> NELLA'S COM VOICE<br>
    I don't know, sir. For a few<br>
    minutes... maybe.</p>
  <p> Picard's face registers what this all means.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, how many colonists are<br>
    left to transport?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Seventy three, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long do you need?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    At least ten more minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the storm will reach the<br>
    northern perimeter in four<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard is faced with a difficult choice... perhaps the<br>
    most difficult decision he's ever had to make.</p>

    Picard to perimeter teams.</p>

  <p> Nella and crew receive Picard's static-ridden<br>
    communique with grim faces.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    ... It is imperative that you hold<br>
    your positions until we finish the<br>
    evacuation of the colony. Picard<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> Off Nella's face...</p>
  <p>51A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard's look reflects his concern. He may just have<br>
    condemned Nella to death.</p>
  <p> After a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard to La Forge.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Keep a signal lock on all<br>
    perimeter team members.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, the storm's interference<br>
    won't --</p>
  <p> But Picard interrupts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As soon as the last of the<br>
    colonists are evacuated I want<br>
    those perimeter teams out of<br>
    there. Is that understood?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p>51B EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - NIGHT</p>
  <p> Nella is scanning the invisible deflector field with<br>
    her tricorder. She gets a troubling reading.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - REV. 01/26/93 - ACT FIVE 47A.</p>
  <p>51B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    (activates combadge)<br>
    Daren to perimeter teams... the<br>
    storm's interference is going to<br>
    make our job harder than we<br>
    thought. We may lose<br>
    communication, so it's up to each<br>
    of you to keep your units<br>
    operational.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A lot of people are depending on<br>
    us. Daren, out.</p>
  <p> We hear the sound of the storm getting closer. Nella<br>
    moves onto the rock face to get a higher vantage point.</p>
  <p>52 CLOSE - NELLA</p>

  <p> NELLA<br>
    (under her breath)<br>
    Oh, my god.</p>
  <p>53 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Nella's POV of the approaching FIRESTORM. The<br>
    deflector field FRITZES on for a moment -- it seems<br>
    scant protection from the immense angry cloud of flame<br>
    that is bearing down on them... there's no way out.</p>
  <p>54 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard and Worf are at an aft station, looking at the<br>
    OKUDAGRAM seen earlier.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT FIVE 48.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> As they watch, the perimeter positions, blinking green,<br>
    are overrun by the solid red field of the firestorm.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The storm has reached the<br>
    perimeter.</p>
  <p>55 CLOSE - PICARD</p>
  <p> we can only imagine what he's going through.</p>
  <p>56 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it orbits Bersallis.</p>
  <p>57 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker is seated on an examining table, being attended<br>
    to by Beverly. All background beds are filled.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the corridor. When Riker sees him,<br>
    his face tightens.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I got out with the last of the<br>
    colonists. If it hadn't been for<br>
    the perimeter teams, we wouldn't<br>
    have made it.</p>
  <p> At least Picard knows that he made the right decision --<br>
    those who sacrificed their lives did so to save many<br>
    others. But Picard takes no comfort in knowing this.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We managed to get four of the<br>
    teams off the surface.<br>
    (grim)<br>
    The interference kept us from<br>
    getting the other two... I don't<br>
    see how they could have survived.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in, stone-faced.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Which teams are missing?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Three and six.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT FIVE 49.</p>
  <p>57 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker senses that though Picard desperately wants to<br>
    know, he can't bring himself to ask.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The last I knew, Commander Daren<br>
    was with team six.</p>
  <p> Picard's face is ashen. He nods, then turns and leaves<br>
    the room.</p>
  <p>58 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard is very much alone. He sits very still.<br>
    Silence.</p>
  <p> After a long moment, he looks over at the table where<br>
    his flute sits in its case.</p>
  <p> He crosses over to the table and looks down at it. He<br>
    reaches out his hand, and carefully closes the case<br>
    shut... It is as if a chapter in his life is gone<br>
    forever.</p>
  <p> After a moment, the silence is interrupted.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Bridge to Captain.</p>
  <p> It takes Picard a long moment to respond.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    We've found survivors, sir..<br>
    They're beaming up now.</p>
  <p> Everything is written on Picard's face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p>59 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> where a few perimeter team members are being helped off<br>
    the pad by medical personnel; they're in bad shape,<br>
    their uniforms blackened with smoke.</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS and sees that Nella is not among them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Lessons&quot; - 01/25/93 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He keeps his face even -- it wouldn't be appropriate to<br>
    show his crew that he was looking for someone in<br>
    particular.</p>
  <p> As an N.D. survivor passes, Picard puts a reassuring<br>
    hand to his shoulder.</p>
  <p> When the last of the survivors have filed out, Picard<br>
    turns to leave as well -- any hope of seeing Nella<br>
    again is gone.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, he hears the sound of the transporter humming<br>
    to life. He stops and turns to face the chamber.</p>
  <p> As the N.D. works the console, three figures begin to<br>
    MATERIALIZE on the pad. As Picard watches, the woman<br>
    he thought he'd lost takes shape before his eyes.<br>
    Nella is safe.</p>
  <p> A look of incredible relief washes over Picard's face.<br>
    Inside, he wants to run to hold her, but he's the<br>
    Captain. He can't.</p>
  <p> Their eyes meet for a brief moment before the medical<br>
    technicians take her away. But there was something in<br>
    Nella's eyes Picard can't place...</p>

  <p>61 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Nella sits opposite Picard. Although it's an informal<br>

  <p> NELLA (Cont'd)<br>
    We modified our phasers to create<br>
    resonant disruptions in the<br>
    deflector field... the disruptions<br>

    plane of the field... and we each<br>
    stood inside one to wait out the<br>

    (beat)<br>
    Richardson didn't make it... all<br>

  <p> NELLA<br>
    At first, when I heard you tell us<br>

  <p>61 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> A long beat passes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Part of you must have... blamed<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    A small part, maybe... But in the<br>
    end, I was more afraid that you<br>
    would blame yourself if I died.</p>
  <p> She gives him a weak smile.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Would you have?</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates... rises... paces toward the window,<br>
    gathering thoughts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've lost people under my<br>
    command... people I cared about<br>
    deeply... but never someone I've<br>
    been in love with.</p>
  <p> He turns back to face her.</p>

  <p>61 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When I thought you were dead, I<br>
    went into some kind of shutdown...<br>
    I didn't want to think, I didn't<br>
    want to feel. I was here, in my<br>
    quarters, and... the only thing I<br>
    could focus on was music... and<br>
    how it would never give me joy<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> She is silent, watching him. A long beat...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Well... where do we go from here?</p>
  <p> He turns to her... says the difficult words.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We could continue... hoping we<br>
    wouldn't face a situation like<br>
    that again... knowing that we<br>
    might... hoping the pressures on<br>
    us wouldn't begin to erode our<br>

    That's not what I want for us.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I know. Neither do I.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    I don't think we can serve on the<br>

  <p> She looks at him, knowing he's right... wishing it<br>
    weren't so...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    It would be difficult... for both<br>
    of us.</p>
  <p> There is a long, difficult moment... each hoping the<br>
    other will somehow refuse to accept the inevitable.<br>
    But --</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    I'll put in for a transfer.</p>
  <p> Picard takes this in.</p>

  <p> She smiles sadly. In theory they can... but starships<br>
    range wide... schedules are difficult to coordinate...</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Yes, of course.</p>
  <p> Beyond that, there's nothing else to say. Now, staying<br>
    there feels awkward. She rises, moves to him... lifts<br>
    a hand to his cheek, and kisses him softly on the<br>
    mouth.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>
    Promise me something?</p>
  <p> Picard looks at her.</p>
  <p> NELLA<br>

    Don't give up your music.</p>
  <p> Picard nods almost imperceptibly.</p>
  <p> She smiles through her sadness... then walks out the<br>
