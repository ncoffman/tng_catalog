  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> holding position near a starbase.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46192.3.<br>
    We have arrived at Starbase<br>
    one-one-two and are loading relief<br>
    supplies destined for Tagra Four,<br>
    an ecologically devastated planet<br>
    in the Argolis Cluster. We have<br>
    also taken on a rather unusual<br>
    passenger.</p>
  <p>2 INT. READY ROOM - CLOSE - PICARD</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Welcome to the Enterprise. We're<br>
    delighted to have you aboard.</p>
  <p>3 WIDEN</p>
  <p> to include BEVERLY and eighteen-year-old AMANDA<br>
    ROGERS.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Thank you, Sir.</p>
  <p> Amanda is excited and a bit nervous; she can hardly<br>
    believe she's being welcomed to the Enterprise by its<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Congratulations. I understand<br>
    you were selected from among<br>
    hundreds of applicants for this<br>
    internship.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Yes, sir. I still can't believe<br>
    they chose me... there were lots<br>
    of people with better records...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Your transcript is very<br>
    impressive...<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    She's done honors work in<br>
    neurobiology, plasma dynamics,<br>
    and eco-regeneration. I'd call<br>
    that pretty well-rounded.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    That's a nice way of saying I<br>
    haven't made up my mind about<br>
    what I want to do with my life.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've arranged to have you work<br>
    in all the major departments while<br>
    you're here. I'm willing to bet<br>
    that by the time it's over you'll<br>
    have a pretty good idea what field<br>
    you're interested in.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Or at least what fields you're not<br>
    interested in.</p>
  <p> Amanda smiles; they're making her feel welcome aboard<br>
    this strange new ship. The door chime SOUNDS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> RIKER ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're bringing up the last of the<br>
    cargo, sir. We should be ready<br>
    to leave within the hour.</p>
  <p> Picard nods his acknowledgement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander, would you escort Ms.<br>
    Rogers to her quarters? I have<br>
    to discuss the Tagran's medical<br>
    needs with Doctor Crusher.</p>
  <p> Riker nods; Amanda stands.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've won yourself a rare<br>
    opportunity. Avail yourself of<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I will, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles; she crosses toward the door.</p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as Riker and Amanda make their way down it. She walks<br>
    with downcast eyes, stricken with shyness in front of<br>
    the dashing First Officer. Riker smiles to himself,<br>
    decides to try and put her at ease.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It'll take a few days before you<br>
    know your way around. If you<br>
    ever need help just use one of<br>
    the companels...</p>
  <p> He gestures to a companel as they pass it.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    We're on deck seven, section...<br>
    (unsure)<br>
    Four?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    That's right.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I practically memorized the specs<br>
    on the way here.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're a quick study.</p>
  <p> They've arrived at the door to her quarters.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    This is it.</p>
  <p> INT. AMANDA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> as she and Riker ENTER. Her bags are already there,<br>
    having been brought directly from the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Amanda looks around, seems a little surprised.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Is this for me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All yours.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    It's so... big.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    For honor students, only the best.</p>
  <p> She looks around.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I could've brought The Zoo.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The zoo?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    That's what my parents call it.<br>
    Three dogs isn't so many, is it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Depends how they get along.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I'd have a dozen, but my mother<br>
    said enough is enough.</p>
  <p> They share a smile.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I'm sure going to miss them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll try and keep you so busy<br>
    you won't have time to.<br>
    (he smiles)<br>
    I'd better be going; I have to get<br>
    back to the Cargo Bay.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Thanks for walking me down.</p>
  <p> Amanda watches Riker EXIT, her eyes linger on the door<br>
    as it shuts behind him. She turns and suddenly her<br>
    eyes widen in shock.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>6 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Amanda's room is suddenly full of PUPPIES... a dozen<br>
    of them, yapping and wagging their tails. Amanda's<br>
    hand flies to cover her mouth in dismay.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Oh, no... I didn't mean it...</p>
  <p> She kneels as the puppies rush to her feet.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    You can't be here... Go away.</p>
  <p> A handful of the puppies DISAPPEAR.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    All of you.</p>
  <p> The rest of the puppies in front of her DISAPPEAR as<br>
    well, leaving two behind her. She can't help but pet<br>
    them for a moment before saying:</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    You too.</p>
  <p> They VANISH also. Amanda flops herself down so she's<br>
    sitting on the floor. She looks scared... like someone<br>
    keeping a terrible secret... Off her reaction we...</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>7 INT. MEDICAL LAB (OR STORAGE AREA)</p>
  <p> Beverly is showing Amanda the readout dials on a<br>
    medical TRICORDER.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    See these readouts? This is your<br>
    heart rate, your blood pressure...<br>
    all your vital signs.</p>
  <p> Amanda looks at the dials with interest.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You're in good shape.<br>
    (wry)<br>
    You might just live to be my age.</p>
  <p> Amanda smiles. Beverly indicates the storage shelf<br>
    from which she took the device.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All these tricorders have to be<br>
    tested before they get put in the<br>
    supply containers we're taking<br>
    to Tagra.</p>
  <p> She indicates the small carrying cases stacked on a<br>
    nearby table.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    So I scan myself with each one<br>
    to make sure all the readouts are<br>
    working?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    If they're not, put that unit<br>
    aside and we'll run a diagnostic<br>
    on it.</p>
  <p> Beverly puts the tricorder she's been holding in a<br>
    container.</p>
  <p> Amanda takes another tricorder off the shelf and starts<br>
    scanning herself.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    So I understand you were accepted<br>
    to the Academy... I have a son<br>
    there.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Being posted on the Enterprise,<br>
    I guess you don't get to see him<br>
    very often... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Not as often as I'd like.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Do you have any other children?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    My husband died a number of years<br>
    ago. Wes was our only child.</p>
  <p> Amanda is quiet for a moment.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Was he old enough to know his<br>
    father?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jack died when he was five.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    My parents died when I was a baby.<br>
    I don't remember anything about<br>
    them... Sometimes I wonder what<br>
    they were like.</p>
  <p> Beverly can appreciate how she might want to know about<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I understand your adopted parents<br>
    are in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They're marine biologists... They<br>
    were just posted to the Bilaren<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly is called on the com.</p>
  <p> NURSE'S COM VOICE<br>
    Sickbay to Doctor Crusher... you<br>
    wanted to be told when the<br>
    cultures were ready.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    On my way.<br>
    (to Amanda)<br>
    I have to go. When you've<br>
    finished with the tricorders,<br>
    Nurse Ogawa can help you take them<br>
    down to the Shuttlebay for<br>
    loading.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Okay.</p>
  <p> They share a warm smile and Beverly leaves her to her<br>
    task.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p>9 INT. SHUTTLEBAY TWO</p>
  <p> The place is buzzing with activity. NDs bustle around<br>
    packing crates and loading them into the SHUTTLECRAFT.</p>
  <p> Amanda has just delivered the tricorders she's been<br>
    checking to GEORDI; he holds a PADD and has his hands<br>
    full coordinating everything.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks for your help. We need<br>
    every spare hand we can get; this<br>
    is one of the biggest relief<br>
    efforts we've ever mounted.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Why are you taking everything down<br>
    in shuttlecraft?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can't use the transporters<br>
    because of all the ionization in<br>
    the Tagran atmosphere.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    From the barystatic filters?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (a little surprised)<br>
    How'd you know that?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I did a paper on eco-regeneration.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles and motions for Amanda to follow him over<br>
    to a shuttlecraft.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Then you know that a thousand<br>
    barystatic filters put out a lot<br>
    of ionization...</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (that many?)<br>
    A thousand... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They've managed to pollute their<br>
    atmosphere pretty badly.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    It's amazing... that they go to<br>
    such lengths to clean the air...<br>
    instead of regulating the<br>
    emissions that cause the problem.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (simply)<br>
    You're right.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Amanda share a rueful look; it all seems<br>
    so shortsighted to them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS and we see him in the background talking<br>
    to an ND. Amanda's attention is diverted.</p>
  <p> Geordi is half way inside a console by now so he<br>
    doesn't notice.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    All the filters can do is keep<br>
    things from getting worse. They<br>
    shoot negative ions into the<br>
    planet's stratosphere --</p>
  <p> Amanda watches Riker as he takes a PADD from an ND and<br>
    begins checking it over. The ND moves away, leaving<br>
    Riker standing alone near the overhang which contains<br>
    the control booth.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    -- where they come into contact<br>
    with airborne pollutants and<br>
    transfer their charge. The<br>
    filters have positively charged<br>
    intake vents that the pollutants<br>
    become attracted to; that sets<br>
    up a kind of ionic current in the<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p> Amanda isn't even hearing his techno-ramble, her<br>
    attention is now completely on the handsome figure cut<br>
    by the First Officer.</p>
  <p>9A CLOSE ON A TOOL CASE</p>
  <p> on the railing of the overhang. It suddenly moves<br>
    forward, as though of its own volition, and teeters<br>
    on the edge of the stack.</p>
  <p>9B ANGLE ON AMANDA</p>
  <p> as her eye is caught by the movement. Then, the<br>
    case shifts forward again and begins FALLING right<br>
    toward Riker. There isn't even time to shout a<br>
    warning...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>9B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Amanda reaches out instinctively and suddenly the<br>
    case's fall is diverted -- as if some unseen force<br>
    lanced out from her outstretched arm -- and it crashes<br>
    to the ground just a few feet away from him.</p>
  <p> Everyone in the room reacts with a start. It looks<br>
    for all the world to have been a near miss.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (calling from across<br>
    the room)<br>
    Commander, are you all right?</p>
  <p> Riker's a little shaken. Geordi crosses toward him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yeah... I didn't even see it<br>
    coming...</p>
  <p> No one except Amanda knows what really happened. And<br>
    from the look on her face, we can see that she is<br>
    disturbed and frightened by the strange event.</p>
  <p>10 INT. AMANDA'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Amanda is alone in her quarters, mulling over the<br>
    strange events of the past few days. If only there<br>
    was someone she could talk to about it all. But what<br>
    if they thought she was a freak? They used to burn<br>
    witches!</p>
  <p> A SOUND at the door. Amanda leaps off the bed and<br>
    stares at it. Maybe they've found her out?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (hesitantly)<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door opens to reveal TROI standing there holding<br>
    a puppy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander Riker told me you liked<br>
    dogs...</p>
  <p> Amanda is delighted. She moves forward to take<br>
    the puppy.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (to puppy)<br>
    What's your name?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    This is Henry.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Henry?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (shrugging)<br>
    Don't ask me.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Where'd he come from?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Ensign Janklow is going to the<br>
    Gantol excavations for three<br>
    weeks. He's been trying to find<br>
    someone to take care of Henry.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (instantly)<br>
    I'll do it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Okay. But be warned -- he has<br>
    an appetite for boots.</p>
  <p> Amanda laughs and puts Henry down to explore the room.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    By the time Ensign Janklow gets<br>
    back I'll have Henry shaking<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> She and Troi move to chairs and sit.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Doctor Crusher tells me you're<br>
    considering a career in zoology.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I was... but this morning I<br>
    decided to become a Starfleet<br>
    doctor... then by this afternoon<br>
    I realized I was really meant to<br>
    be a Chief Engineer.</p>
  <p> They share a smile.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    What does a ship's counselor do?<br>
    Maybe that's what I'll want to<br>
    be by tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles at the young woman's enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>

    I'm just afraid I won't have<br>
    enough time for everything I want<br>
    to do. I mean --<br>
    (ticking them off)<br>
    -- there's school, and then<br>
    graduate study, and a career...<br>
    and of course I want to get<br>
    married and have children -- lots<br>
    of children -- and more animals...<br>

    Maybe I should study<br>
    agriculture... have a big farm<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Amanda... whatever you choose,<br>
    I'm sure you'll be good at it.</p>

    ENTERS.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's a little shaken up, but<br>
    she'll be all right.</p>
  <p> Everyone's relieved to hear this -- despite the mystery<br>
    posed by the incident in Engineering, they've all grown<br>
    quite fond of Amanda.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You said she was adopted... could<br>
    she be an alien?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She's human... and there's nothing<br>
    unusual about her, not that my<br>
    instruments can detect.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Commander, have you been able to<br>
    determine the cause of the warp<br>
    breach?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, sir. Everything was normal<br>
    and then... it's like the laws<br>
    of physics suddenly went out the<br>

    Mon Capitan.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you responsible for the<br>
    incident in Engineering?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Of course. I needed to find out<br>
    if what I suspected about the girl<br>
    was true.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That being?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    That she's Q.</p>
  <p> This notion, dropped lightly by Q, falls like a<br>
    bombshell on the others.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Amanda... is a Q... ?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How is that possible? Her<br>
    parents... her biological<br>
    parents... were human.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Not exactly.</p>
  <p> They regard him curiously.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    They had assumed human form...<br>
    in order to visit Earth. For an<br>
    amusement, I suppose... but in<br>
    vulgar human fashion they<br>
    proceeded to conceive a child.</p>
  <p> He shrugs, not comprehending this strange behavior.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Then, like mawkish humans, they<br>
    became attached to it. What is<br>
    it about those squirming little<br>
    infants that you find so<br>
    appealing?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure that's beyond your<br>
    comprehension, Q.</p>

  <p> Q<br>
    I desperately hope so.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What happened to Amanda's parents?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    They died in an accident. None<br>
    of us knew whether the child would<br>
    inherit the capacities of a Q...<br>
    but recently, they began to<br>
    emerge. As an expert on humanity<br>
    -- I was sent to investigate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (sarcastic)<br>
    You, an expert on humanity... ?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (likewise)<br>
    Not a very challenging field of<br>
    study, I'll grant you...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Are you saying you caused the core<br>
    breach -- just to test her?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What if she hadn't been able to<br>
    stop it?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (it's obvious)<br>
    Then I would've known she wasn't<br>
    Q.</p>
  <p> There are reactions to this cavalier attitude.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Now that you know, what do you<br>
    intend to do?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Instruct her, of course. If that<br>
    child doesn't learn how to control<br>
    her power... she could accidently<br>
    destroy herself. Or all of you.<br>
    Perhaps your entire galaxy.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Somehow I find it hard to believe<br>
    that you'd come here to do us a<br>
    favor...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You're quite right -- I wouldn't.<br>
    But there are those in the<br>
    Continuum who have an exaggerated<br>
    sense of responsibility... and<br>
    think we should take precautions<br>
    to keep the little dear from<br>
    running amuck.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And once you've taught her...<br>
    you'll go away?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And leave her here... when she's<br>
    Q? Of course not... she'll come<br>
    to the Continuum, where she<br>
    belongs.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (irate)<br>
    Wait a minute... you can't just<br>
    come in here and take her away<br>
    from everything she's known...</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I assure you, I can --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    She has plans for herself... she<br>
    wants a career, a family --</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I can rescue her from that<br>
    miserable existence.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That &quot;miserable existence&quot; is all<br>
    she's known for eighteen years.<br>
    You have no right to take it away<br>
    from her.</p>
  <p> Q<br>

    There. Isn't that better? Doctor<br>
    Crusher gets more shrill with each<br>
    passing year...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it you really want, Q?<br>
    Why bring Amanda here... to the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (expansively)<br>
    Where better than here, among my<br>
    dear friends? After all... you<br>
    know so much about the Q...<br>
    you're the perfect people to<br>
    introduce me to the child. Let<br>
    her know she can trust me.</p>
  <p> This brings an outright laugh from Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Trust you -- !</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Jean-Luc... you wound me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't trust you and I certainly<br>
    wouldn't expect Amanda to.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    She'd better -- because I'm all<br>
    she's got. She needs me to<br>
    prepare her... for her future with<br>
    the Q.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She may not want that future.<br>
    The decision is hers.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Yes, yes -- fine.<br>
    (amused by the thought)<br>
    But do you really think she'll<br>
    want to remain a feeble mortal?</p>
  <p> Picard ignores his mocking tone, thinks for a moment...<br>
    not liking what he comes up with.</p>

    I'll introduce you, but we cannot<br>
    continue to fight like this in<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    It does not seem consistent with<br>
    what we know of them.</p>

  <p> Beverly and Amanda are sitting together on the couch.<br>
    Though she is still grappling with the enormous<br>
    implications of what she's been told, the news does<br>
    explain certain things that have been happening.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    It started happening about six<br>
    months ago... things I wished for<br>
    suddenly appearing... objects<br>
    moving on their own... I thought<br>
    I was going crazy...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    In a funny way, finding this out<br>

    The person I mentioned... from<br>
    the Q Continuum... would like to<br>
    meet you. If you want to...</p>
  <p> Amanda takes a breath. Things are moving awfully fast,<br>
    but she might as well start facing what's coming.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I'm ready.</p>
  <p> Beverly starts toward the door... but before she<br>
    reaches it, Q WALKS THROUGH IT, heading right for<br>
    Amanda, who looks startled.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    There's my girl!</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him a look.</p>
  <p> The door OPENS, revealing Picard, who ENTERS, and moves<br>
    toward Amanda, trying to make this a comfortable<br>
    introduction. He finds himself in the odd position of<br>
    having to put Q in the best possible light.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Amanda, this is Q.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He is...<br>
    (searching)<br>
    ... an acquaintance of ours. We've<br>

  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Q is circling Amanda, sizing her up as though she's<br>
    a race horse. It makes her quite uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Very impressive the way you<br>
    contained that explosion. What<br>
    else have you done?</p>
  <p> His brusque tone isn't helping to put Amanda at ease.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I... don't understand.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Telekinesis, teleportation,<br>
    spontaneous combustion of someone<br>
    you didn't like -- that sort of<br>
    thing.</p>
  <p> Amanda looks baffled and Picard steps in to help.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think what Q means to ask is...<br>
    have you deliberately used your<br>
    abilities... ?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Not until I came here. The first<br>
    time was when the container almost<br>
    fell on Commander Riker.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You did so well with that I<br>
    decided to give you a real<br>
    challenge... the warp core<br>
    breach.</p>
  <p> He takes her face in his hands, turning it this way and<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    She clearly has potential. I see<br>
    no reason why she can't come back<br>
    to the Continuum right now.</p>

    Don't worry. With time you'll<br>

    disadvantages you suffered as a<br>
    child. No one will hold it<br>
    against you that you were human.</p>
  <p> Amanda turns to Picard in distress.</p>

    Let's go, Amanda.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    She doesn't want to --</p>
  <p> But as Q reaches Amanda she reacts, lifting her arm...<br>
    and suddenly Q goes flying across the room, crashing<br>
    into a wall.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Leave me alone! I'm not going<br>
    anywhere with you!</p>
  <p> A shaken Q looks at her with new respect... and the<br>
    awareness that this isn't going to be as easy as he<br>
    thought.</p>
  <p>17 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is with Q; he's irate at Q's behavior. Q is<br>
    vaguely listening; he fussily brushes and tugs at his<br>
    uniform, as if it had been mussed in his fall.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You agreed she has the right to<br>
    decide her own future... yet the<br>
    first chance you get you try to<br>
    abduct her.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You overreact as usual, Jean-Luc.<br>
    I assure you -- I was merely<br>
    testing her power. She's quite<br>

    What's going on, Q? What's your<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    I've made that quite clear. The<br>
    Continuum has a vested interest<br>
    in this young woman...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you intend to protect that<br>
    investment, I suggest you approach<br>
    her differently.</p>

    She's just a little skittish.<br>
    She'll have to start behaving like<br>
    a Q.</p>

  <p> AMANDA<br>
    But he's horrible.</p>

    But he's the only one who can help<br>
    you understand who you are. There<br>

    have to make about your future...<br>
    and you can't make them by<br>
    ignoring the truth.</p>

    sepulchral.</p>

    Your progress, Q?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    As anticipated there have been<br>
    some problems... but the humans<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    (ingratiating)<br>
    Hello, my dear...</p>
  <p> But Amanda stares stonily at him, not responding at<br>
    all. Q takes a breath... realizes he's going to have<br>
    to eat some crow. It doesn't come easily.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I've been told that I behaved<br>
    badly. I...<br>
    (almost choking)<br>
    ... a-pol-ogize...</p>
  <p> Amanda nods a cool acknowledgement.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Apparently you had every right<br>
    to chastise me...<br>
    (he's had enough of<br>

  <p> Amanda eyes him, steely.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>

    What, exactly, are the Q?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    It would be so much easier to show<br>
    you than to tell you. If you'd<br>
    just agree to take a short visit<br>
    to the Continuum --</p>
  <p> But Amanda's having none of that.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    No. Just tell me.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    To put it simply... we are<br>
    omnipotent. There is nothing --<br>
    nothing -- we can't do.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    And what do you do with this<br>
    power?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Whatever we want.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Do you use it to help others?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    I think you've missed the point.<br>
    You've obviously spent far too<br>
    much time among humans.</p>
  <p> He moves closer to her, trying to spin a web of<br>
    enticement.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    As a Q, you can have your heart's<br>
    desire instantly... whatever it<br>
    might be. Would you like precious<br>
    jewels? Works of art? Would you<br>
    like to visit the rings of<br>

    baby, tickling it under the chin, etc. and smiling<br>
    with what could only be described as unadorned love.</p>

    Now that you put it like that,<br>

    Now, be truthful, Amanda. Wasn't<br>
    it amusing?<br>

  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (acknowledging, a little<br>

    Well...</p>

    You're going to have to start<br>

    Don't worry, Amanda. You can do<br>

    You don't have to eat, you know.<br>
    It's just a nasty human habit you<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>

    Troi and Beverly are astonished.</p>
  <p>31 EXT. A GAZEBO - NIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in the woods, as Amanda and Riker APPEAR under its<br>
    roof. Amanda wears an elegant evening dress; Riker<br>
    is formally attired.</p>
  <p> The gazebo's white slatted joints are intertwined with<br>
    vines. It is night, and the few leafy branches that<br>
    are visible are enough to suggest that the gazebo is<br>
    deep in an enchanted forest.</p>
  <p> Riker realizes that the very elaborateness of what<br>
    she's now doing demonstrates the depth of her<br>
    infatuation with him, and he knows he needs to be<br>
    careful with her feelings.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (evenly)<br>
    What's this all about?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I thought it might be nice for<br>
    us to spend some time alone<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> She smiles radiantly at him...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you should take us back<br>
    to Ten Forward.</p>
  <p> She moves toward him... wanting to be seductive...<br>
    needing to be taken seriously as a woman.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Are you sure? Wouldn't you like<br>
    to be here with me for a while?</p>
  <p> She gestures.</p>

    It's very pleasant. But that's<br>
    not the point...</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Oh... ?</p>
  <p> She twines her arms around his neck.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>

    No...<br>

    You can't just snatch people away<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you're a lovely young<br>

    be swept off his feet by her grand fantasy.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>

    changes. He looks at her with devotion...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Amanda...</p>
  <p> He moves toward her, takes her in his arms in a<br>
    passionate embrace.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're so beautiful...</p>
  <p> He kisses her fully, Amanda enjoying the exquisiteness<br>
    of the moment... they break apart and he buries his<br>
    head in her neck.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Do you love me?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes... more than anything...</p>
  <p> She stands for a moment as he kisses her neck and<br>
    shoulder... a sad expression steals over her. She<br>
    steps back from him... and his expression changes back<br>
    to normal Riker. He blinks, not sure of what's<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (softly)<br>
    You're right... none of this is<br>
    real...</p>
  <p> She turns her back on him, embarrassed now at the whole<br>
    situation.</p>

  <p> But she's humiliated, near tears... moves away from<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Just go back to Ten Forward...</p>
  <p> Riker DISAPPEARS. Then she bursts into tears, a young<br>

  <p> Q<br>
    Bon jour, mon Capitan. You wanted<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I want to ask you about<br>
    Amanda's biological parents. When<br>
    they decided to remain on Earth,<br>
    what was the reaction in the<br>
    Continuum?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    We found it incomprehensible.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were they pressured to come back?<br>
    Were they threatened with<br>
    punishment if they didn't?</p>

  <p>33A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    What are you getting at, Picard?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The circumstance of their death<br>
    was a bit odd... a tornado that<br>
    escaped the Weather Modification<br>
    Net... and then touched down in<br>
    only one spot -- Amanda's home.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    You never can predict the<br>
    weather...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tornadoes develop from existing<br>
    storm fronts... and there were<br>
    no storm fronts in Kansas that<br>
    day. Witnesses reported that the<br>
    funnel materialized<br>
    spontaneously... directly over<br>
    Amanda's home... destroyed it...<br>
    and then disappeared.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    If you say so. I wasn't there.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Were Amanda's parents executed...<br>
    by the Q Continuum?</p>
  <p> Q hesitates before answering.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    And what if they were?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I think Amanda has the right<br>
    to know that before she makes a<br>
    choice about her future.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Don't be foolish, Picard. She<br>
    has no choice. She never did.</p>
  <p> Picard starts to retort, but Q rides over him.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    If she is truly Q, she must come<br>
    where she belongs, to the<br>

  <p> Q's gesture is clear; they will kill her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you that despicable, Q?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Don't be naive. You have no idea<br>
    what it means to be Q. With<br>
    unlimited power comes the need<br>
    for responsibility. Do you think<br>
    we can allow an omnipotent being<br>
    to roam free in the universe?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And... what have you concluded?<br>
    Does she live... or does she die?</p>

    You're such a plucky little thing.<br>
    I do enjoy you, you know.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Amanda's question deserves an<br>
    answer, Q. You've made yourself<br>
    judge, jury, and -- if necessary<br>
    -- executioner. By what right<br>
    do you appoint yourself to this<br>
    position?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Superior morality...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I recall how you used your<br>
    superior morality when we first<br>
    encountered you. You put us<br>
    on trial for the crimes of<br>
    humanity.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The jury is still out, Picard.<br>
    Make no mistake.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your arrogant pretense to being<br>
    the moral guardians of the<br>
    universe strikes me as a bit pale<br>
    today. You have shown no evidence<br>
    that you are guided by a superior<br>
    moral code -- by any code<br>
    whatsoever. You may be nearly<br>
    omnipotent -- I won't deny your<br>
    parlor tricks are impressive --<br>
    but morality? No, I don't see<br>
    it. I don't acknowledge it. I<br>
    would put human morality against<br>
    the Q's any day.</p>
  <p> Q looks at him sharply.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps that's the fascination<br>
    we humans hold for you... ? That<br>
    by our puny example we give you<br>
    a glimmer of the one thing that<br>
    eludes your omnipotence -- a moral<br>
    center.</p>
  <p> Q refuses to react in any way.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 54A.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If so, I can think of no crueler<br>
    irony than for you to destroy<br>
    a young woman whose only crime...<br>
    is being too human.</p>
  <p> Q has perhaps been struck by the truth of Picard's words...<br>
    but of course can't acknowledge that. He applauds.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Jean-Luc, Jean-Luc... sometimes<br>
    I think the only reason I come<br>
    here is to listen to these<br>
    wonderful speeches of yours. But<br>
    in this case your concerns are<br>
    unwarranted. We've decided not<br>
    to harm her. We're prepared to<br>
    offer her a choice.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    (wary)<br>
    What kind of choice?</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You can come with me to the<br>
    Continuum --</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Or... ?</p>
  <p> Q eyes her.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    The other choice is more<br>
    difficult.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You have within yourself the<br>
    ability to refrain from using the<br>
    power of Q. If you can do that<br>
    -- you can stay here.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Then I'm staying here.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Think carefully... it won't be<br>
    easy. Your parents were offered<br>
    the same choice... and they were<br>
    unable to resist using their<br>
    power.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    All I've wanted... since this<br>
    whole thing began... was to be<br>
    a normal human being again. I<br>
    know I can resist.</p>
  <p> Before Q can respond --</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to Picard -- there is an<br>
    emergency message from Commander<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On my way.</p>
  <p> He goes immediately for the Bridge, followed by Amanda<br>
    and Q.</p>
  <p>40 INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as they emerge from the Ready Room. Riker is on the<br>
    viewscreen from the reactor control room. Geordi and<br>
    Lote are in bg.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, the damage to the reactor<br>
    was greater than the Tagrans led<br>
    us to believe. The field<br>
    modulator is installed and<br>
    operational, but it's not going<br>
    to be enough... the reactor's gone<br>
    into overload...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can you correct the problem?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    La Forge is trying to stabilize<br>
    the unit now. We'll stay as long<br>
    as possible... there are thousands<br>
    of people in the area, and if that<br>
    reactor goes...</p>

  <p> LOTE<br>
    (on viewscreen, to<br>
    Riker)<br>
    Commander -- over here, quickly!</p>
  <p> Riker moves off toward Lote and Geordi in the<br>
    background. Picard turns stonily to Q.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this your doing, Q -- ?</p>
  <p> Q spreads his hands in genuine innocence.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Not this time, Picard.</p>
  <p> And he DISAPPEARS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, see if there's<br>
    anything we can do to cut through<br>
    the interference and beam them<br>
    out of there.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker moves back toward the front of the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, La Forge is trying a<br>
    neutrino infusion. There's a<br>
    chance it'll smother the<br>
    reaction...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, there is too much ionization<br>
    in the atmosphere, transporters<br>
    are useless.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>41 ANGLE ON AMANDA</p>
  <p> Through all this, she has been staring at the<br>
    Viewscreen, stricken with the possibility of what might<br>
    happen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    It didn't work, sir. Meltdown<br>
    is imminent.</p>
  <p> Amanda narrows her eyes...</p>
  <p>42 ANGLE FAVORING VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Riker and Geordi stand there, helpless... then, from<br>
    the back of the control room...</p>
  <p> LOTE<br>
    Commander... look at this...</p>
  <p> They turn and inspect a console.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is impossible...</p>
  <p> He turns back to the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know what's happening,<br>
    sir -- but the reaction is<br>
    stabilizing on its own.</p>
  <p> Picard turns... looks at Amanda... but she's<br>
    concentrating on the Viewscreen.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir... I am reading a massive<br>
    energy fluctuation in the planet's<br>
    atmosphere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p> The control room disappears from the Viewscreen and<br>
    is replaced by a view of the planet itself,<br>
    smog-shrouded.</p>
  <p>43 AMANDA</p>
  <p> stares at it... concentrating...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>44 ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The brown veil over the planet is dissipating... and<br>
    Tagra is transformed into a lush, blue-green world...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;True Q&quot; - REV. 9/04/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>45 THE CREW</p>
  <p> stares at the phenomenal transformation.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Atmospheric contaminants have<br>
    dropped to less than one part<br>
    per trillion.<br>
    (glancing at Picard)<br>
    The ecosystem has been restored<br>
    to its natural state.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Amanda... ?</p>
  <p> She turns and looks at him... and then Q APPEARS.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    You see? It's harder to resist<br>
    than you thought...</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I couldn't let all those people<br>
    die...</p>
  <p> She looks around the Bridge... at Picard... at Q...</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Ever since I got here, I've been<br>
    fighting this. Denying the truth.<br>
    Denying what I am.</p>
  <p> She regards them all, a little sad, but knowing she's<br>
    right.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I am Q.</p>
  <p> A look of concentration crosses her features and --<br>
    Beverly APPEARS... looking a bit startled. Q is<br>
    tapping his foot impatiently.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    Doctor Crusher... I've decided...<br>
    I can't stay...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I can't stay here.</p>
  <p> Q<br>
    Now that you've come to your<br>
    senses, can we be off?</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    No. First I'm going to visit my<br>
    parents. And it might take a<br>
    while to explain all this, so<br>
    you'll have to be patient.</p>

  <p> Amanda turns to Beverly... Beverly opens her arms and<br>
    hugs her.</p>
  <p> AMANDA<br>
    I hope I can come visit you<br>
    sometime...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (smiling)<br>
    You're a Q... you can do anything<br>
    you want.</p>
  <p> Amanda smiles, pulls away. She regards them...<br>
    bittersweet tears in her eyes... she and Q DISAPPEAR.</p>
  <p> Our people are left alone, with their memories of a<br>
    very special young woman...</p>
