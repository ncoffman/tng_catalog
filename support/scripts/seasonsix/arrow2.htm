  <p>1 EXT. S.F. STREET - CLOSE ON CLEMENS</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I have long been interested in<br>
    the notion of time travel. In<br>
    fact, I wrote a book about it...<br>
    It chronicled the tale of a man<br>
    from our era who fouled the sixth<br>
    century by introducing newfangled<br>
    gadgets and weapons... all in the<br>
    name of Progress.<br>
    (puffs cigar)<br>
    The idea of time travelers isn't<br>
    so far fetched as it seems...<br>
    in fact, I have learned that, even<br>
    now, people from the future are<br>
    right here in San Francisco...<br>
    and I have no doubt that they are<br>
    intent on fouling our world...<br>
    just like my Yankee did in King<br>
    Arthur's time.<br>
    (leans into camera)<br>
    Well. Let me serve notice: as<br>
    soon as I get the necessary<br>
    evidence, I intend to expose<br>
    them... and make it absolutely<br>
    clear that they are not welcome<br>
    here.</p>
  <p>2 ANGLE - CLEMENS AND YOUNG REPORTER</p>
  <p> revealing that Clemens has been giving an on-the-street<br>
    interview to a young reporter who is taking notes on<br>
    a pad. The kid smiles politely.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/08/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    Yes, sir. And will this be a<br>
    sequel to &quot;Connecticut Yankee,&quot;<br>
    Mister Twain?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (glaring)<br>
    The name's Clemens, son. Sam<br>
    Clemens, with an &quot;e.&quot;</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPOTER<br>
    (jotting it down)<br>
    With an &quot;e&quot;... got it.</p>
  <p> Suddenly Twain stops, spotting something across the<br>
    street.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    'Scuse me.</p>
  <p> Twain hurries away, falling in behind DATA, following<br>
    him down the street -- still seeking &quot;necessary evidence.&quot;<br>
    Camera DROPS OFF on a TALL, ARISTOCRATIC COUPLE moving<br>
    the opposite direction... she carries a satchel, he<br>
    carries a cane with a strange carved snake-head. They<br>
    take no notice of Data. Camera follows them as they<br>
    move through the people on the street in a silent,<br>
    ominous search.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>4 INT. MORGUE - DARKENED ROOM</p>
  <p> Only the vague shapes of drape-covered bodies are<br>
    visible... a hand-held light (lantern?) casts a light.<br>
    Beverly is using a tricorder on the bodies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The coroner said this room<br>
    contained all the cholera<br>
    victims...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It doesn't make sense that so many<br>
    people are dying of cholera --<br>
    it just isn't that virulent.</p>
  <p> Suddenly she stops at one body.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wil... this is strange...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The cerebral cortex... the<br>
    cerebellum... the brain stem...<br>
    the entire nervous system -- has<br>
    been drained of electrochemical<br>
    energy.<br>
    (moving to another body)<br>
    Here's another one... same neural<br>
    depletion...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/15/92 - ACT ONE 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    These people didn't die of cholera<br>
    -- they died because their neural<br>
    energy was drained somehow.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Drained... and taken to Devidia<br>
    Two... for those aliens to<br>
    ingest.</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him a look... this is an appalling<br>
    scenario. Riker looks around the gloomy room, the<br>
    rows of shrouded bodies.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If you were a time-traveller with<br>
    a taste for human neural energy...<br>
    how would you get your supply?</p>
  <p> She eyes him, understanding what he's getting at.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'd travel back to times when<br>
    there were plagues and<br>
    epidemics... when I could murder<br>
    -- and use disease as a cover.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. VICTORIAN BOARDING HOUSE - DAY - STOCK</p>
  <p> Establishing.</p>
  <p>6 INT. BOARDING HOUSE - RENTED ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly are there, reporting to Picard, Troi,<br>
    and Geordi. All are dressed in 19th century garb.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Over half the victims who'd been<br>
    drained of neural energy came from<br>
    a place called Sisters of Hope<br>
    Infirmary.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a charity hospital near the<br>
    waterfront.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If the aliens have been killing<br>
    people there, someone might have<br>
    noticed something unusual...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If they're moving among humans,<br>
    they must have taken human form.<br>
    The question is, how do we know<br>
    who we're looking for... ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The tricorder picked up evidence<br>
    of triolic activity in most of<br>
    the bodies we looked at. If the<br>
    aliens are leaving that signature<br>
    behind, they'll be detectable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (thinks for a moment)<br>
    We might even be able to set<br>
    up some kind of alien alarm<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> They move to collect their things (purses, jackets,<br>
    etc.); Riker goes to Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any luck contacting Data?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    None. The tricorder is<br>
    broadcasting random emissions...<br>
    but the range is pretty limited.<br>
    Almost anything could interfere...</p>
  <p> Riker nods, and they start toward the door, when<br>
    suddenly there's a loud, insistent knocking on the<br>
    door. The group exchanges dismayed glances.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    She's back.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE<br>
    Mister Picard!</p>
  <p> She pronounces it PICK-erd. The others regard the<br>
    Captain, who rises. Geordi removes his VISOR, puts on<br>
    dark glasses.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (resigned)<br>
    Coming, Mrs. Carmichael...</p>
  <p> He opens the door to find MRS. CARMICHAEL standing<br>
    there. She is a short, squat, formidable-looking<br>
    woman, Irish and insistent. She speaks with a thick<br>
    brogue.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    Mister Picard... I'd be remindin'<br>
    you that it's one o'clock.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... ?</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    One o'clock of a Thursday.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles aimiably at her, not sure what she's<br>
    getting at.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    I'm sure I made it clear to you<br>
    that the rent is always due,<br>
    payable in full, by one o'clock<br>
    on Wednesdays.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah. The... rent.</p>
  <p> He turns toward the group; they are at a loss. This<br>
    is, after all, such a foreign concept to them. Picard<br>
    turns back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mrs. Carmichael, my troupe is even<br>
    now in rehearsals for a new<br>
    production.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    Oh? I haven't heard of any new<br>
    production. What play is it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's -- &quot;A Midsummer Night's<br>
    Dream.&quot;</p>
  <p> She starts to speak but he cuts her off.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We've performed in London...<br>
    Paris... Milan... all to sold<br>
    out houses. I assure you, we'll<br>
    be able to pay the rent... with<br>
    a bonus.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    (shaking her head)<br>
    No, no, no... I've heard you<br>
    silver-tongued devils before...</p>
  <p> She advances on Picard, eyes blazing with<br>
    determination.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    I'll have the rent in full...<br>
    tomorrow... by one o'clock -- or<br>
    you'll be performing on the<br>
    street.</p>
  <p> She whirls and marches to the door, slamming it. The<br>
    others share reactions. They've bought a little time<br>
    -- but how will they come up with the rent?</p>
  <p>7 INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The door opens admitting Clemens (without a lit cigar)<br>
    and JACK THE BELLBOY.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    I wouldn't do this for just<br>
    anybody, Mister Clemens. And I<br>
    hope you won't spread it around<br>
    that I let you in...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Of course not, Jack. And I assure<br>
    you -- Mister Data would be most<br>
    upset if you didn't.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> CLEMENS (Cont'd)<br>
    If I don't find that Letter of<br>
    Intent he left for me... our major<br>
    investor is going to pull out and<br>
    take his business elsewhere.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    (knowing)<br>
    It has to do with Mister Data's<br>
    engine, doesn't it?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Engine...</p>
  <p> Jack gestures to the contraption which Data has<br>
    constructed, now working. Clemens, intrigued, walks<br>
    toward it.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Yes... yes... this is exactly what<br>
    it's all about...</p>
  <p> He circles around the device; Jack launches into<br>
    another subject.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    Mister Clemens... I'm gonna do<br>
    you another favor today...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (still looking at<br>
    device)<br>
    Mmmmmm...</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    You're always looking for good<br>
    stories, right?<br>
    (no response)<br>
    Well, I've got a humdinger.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Uh-huh...</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    The story of -- my life. Now,<br>
    I know you might think I'm<br>
    young... but I've covered a lot<br>
    of ground, and if I do say so,<br>
    it'd make for some pretty<br>
    fascinating reading.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    So. What do you think?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (looking up)<br>
    About what?</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    About writing my life story. You<br>
    and me -- literary partners.</p>
  <p> Clemens takes his arm, moves him toward the door,<br>
    feigning interest in order to get him out of there.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    You know, son, there's a maxim<br>
    I've always lived by: no one's<br>
    more qualified to write your story<br>
    than you are.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    Me? Be a writer? You think I<br>
    could?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Long as you write what you know...<br>
    you got any passions, son? Any<br>
    dreams?</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    I'd like to do some travelling...<br>
    maybe go to sea... and Alaska.<br>
    I've always had a notion to see<br>
    Alaska.</p>
  <p> Clemens is moving him toward the door, feigning<br>
    interest in order to get him out of there.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    That's a great idea. If I were<br>
    your age, that's exactly what I'd<br>
    do... Alaska -- the Klondike...<br>
    the Aurora Borealis... that's it,<br>
    follow your dreams. And write<br>
    about them.</p>
  <p> He opens the door, gesturing the young man out.</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    Thank you! Thank you, Mister<br>
    Clemens. That's just what I'm<br>
    going to do!</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (trying to get him out)<br>
    You do that, son --</p>
  <p> JACK<br>
    You'll be seeing my name in print.<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    London... the name's London.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I'm sure I will. Good-bye now.</p>
  <p> And he finally gets the kid out. Clemens returns<br>
    immediately to the device, now begins to examine it<br>
    in earnest. Finally he leans toward it and removes<br>
    the transceiver assembly. The machine stops<br>
    functioning. He slips it in his pocket -- when he<br>
    hears the sound of muffled voices in the hall. He<br>
    heads for the armoire.</p>

  <p>7 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> He reaches it as a key is heard in the lock, and is<br>
    safely behind it when the door opens, admitting Data<br>
    and GUINAN.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    ... so when I finally got to the<br>
    Head Surveyor... I found the<br>
    location of your cavern. But<br>
    you won't be able to get to it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Why is that?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    The only entrance is a mine<br>
    shaft... right in the middle of<br>
    the Presidio... the Army Fort.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps you could arrange for us<br>
    to get in.</p>
  <p> She stares at him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    With permission to dig for the<br>
    mine shaft.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Data... so far I've been able to<br>
    do everything you asked me to.<br>
    But do you really expect me to<br>
    get you into a high-security<br>
    military installation?</p>
  <p> He moves toward the mechanism he has created.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (mildly)<br>
    I have full confidence in your<br>
    persuasive abilities.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Well... this is more interesting<br>
    than giving tea dances.</p>
  <p> Data realizes the mechanism isn't working.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is strange...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    What?</p>

  <p>7 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I left this device activated...<br>
    but the transceiver assembly has<br>
    been removed... without it I will<br>
    be unable to track the time<br>
    shifts.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>

    Samuel Clemens?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    He's been driving me crazy. He<br>
    watches the house, follows me down<br>
    the street asking questions --<br>
    I'd bet you anything he got in<br>
    here and took your -- whatever<br>
    you said.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you are correct, he must be<br>
    told that the device has been<br>
    modified in such a way that<br>
    prolonged contact with human<br>
    tissue would be highly toxic.</p>
  <p> There is a muffled &quot;thump&quot; from the closet. Data and<br>
    Guinan exchange glances. Data moves swiftly to the<br>
    closet door and flings it open. Clemens stands there,<br>
    at once sheepish and defiant, as Data and Guinan stare<br>
    at him.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>8 INT. DATA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> The transceiver assembly lies on the floor. Data<br>
    stoops and picks it up. Clemens tries to regain his<br>
    usual savoir faire.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Madame Guinan... Mister Data...<br>
    good day.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Mister Clemens... shame on you.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Shame, madame? I think not. I<br>
    find no shame in my efforts to<br>
    uncover your plot.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I keep telling you, there is no<br>
    plot --</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Yes... you do keep telling me<br>
    that.<br>
    (a beat, as he regards<br>
    her)<br>
    Mister Data, did you know that<br>
    Madame Guinan here is from a<br>
    renowned Boston family... a close<br>
    relative of Judge Truman Williams?<br>
    (to Guinan)<br>
    I believe that's what you said...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Then... I wonder... why the Judge<br>
    says he's never heard of you?<br>
    That's what his telegram to me<br>
    indicated...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    (unfazed)<br>
    There's been a blood feud between<br>
    two branches of the family. He<br>
    doesn't acknowledge me.</p>

  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Ah. That must wound you deeply.</p>
  <p> He circles the room, eyeing Data and Guinan up and<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    What an interesting pair you<br>
    are... an Ashanti princess...<br>
    and a Swiss. Where in Switzerland<br>
    are you from, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am French, not Swiss.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Of course, that's right... now<br>
    I remember. A Frenchman with<br>
    a talent for poker, from what I<br>
    hear.<br>
    (paces again)<br>
    You know, I was talking with a<br>
    friend of mine, Ches Whitley...<br>
    he said to say hello... wonders<br>
    when you're coming back.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not believe I know Mister<br>
    Whitley.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    No? He works at the County<br>
    Assayer's Office... said you've<br>
    been in there several times...<br>
    claiming to be a geological<br>
    engineer. Wanting information<br>
    about mining operations during<br>
    the 1850's...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Remember him now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know the gentleman by<br>
    name. I have spoken to several<br>
    people in that office.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Yes... I know. And in the Hall<br>
    of Records... and the Geological<br>
    Society... and a little-known<br>
    mineral shop in Chinatown. You<br>
    do get around, don't you?</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    As apparently you do, Mister<br>
    Clemens.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (chuckling)<br>
    I must admit -- you've got me<br>
    mystified.</p>
  <p> He moves toward Data's machine.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    This contraption, for instance.<br>
    Very unusual. It looks quite --<br>
    futuristic. Tell me -- might<br>
    it have something to do with<br>
    &quot;time shifts&quot;?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In a sense. The time shift is<br>
    a new gearing system that I have<br>
    invented... for a horseless<br>
    carriage.</p>
  <p> Clemens glares at both of them, fed up with cat and<br>
    mouse.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Do not insult me.<br>
    (moving to Data)<br>
    You've come to this century and<br>
    brought your infernal technology<br>
    with you... for God only knows<br>
    what purpose... but I have no<br>
    doubt that it will be the people<br>
    of this century who will suffer<br>
    for it.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Mister Clemens, I think we've had<br>
    quite enough of this. Mister<br>
    Data's business is his own, and<br>
    I'd thank you to leave.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT TWO 18.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Pardon me, Madame, but it is<br>
    my business... it is the business<br>
    of all humanity, I believe, to<br>
    stop both of you from whatever<br>
    it is you are doing here. And<br>
    that is what I intend to do.</p>
  <p> And he's out the door, leaving Data and Guinan relieved<br>
    that he's gone, but mindful that he could be a lot of<br>
    trouble before this is over.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. INFIRMARY STREET - NEXT DAY</p>
  <p> Riker (still as a policeman) strolls the street in<br>
    front of the infirmary, cordially doffing his hat at<br>
    various passersby.</p>
  <p>10 INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Beverly, dressed as a nurse, wearing wire-rimmed<br>
    glasses, is following DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE as he makes<br>
    rounds. He seems to be a kindly doctor, but underneath<br>
    lie the typical assumptions of 19th century sexism and<br>
    racism. In the bg, Troi and Geordi (with dark glasses),<br>
    are passing out little parcels to patients, chatting<br>
    with them as they do. Geordi is carrying the tray of<br>
    parcels.</p>
  <p> Doctor Apollinaire lifts the wrist of one moribund<br>
    man, feels for a pulse.</p>

  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    He won't last the day.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Aren't we going to treat him?</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    I wish we could. But at this<br>
    point there's nothing to be done.<br>
    Unless you know of some miracle<br>
    treatment.</p>
  <p> Beverly moves toward a medicine tray, picks up a<br>
    vial.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Why don't we try an alkaline<br>
    saline solution... to counteract<br>
    dehydration?</p>
  <p> Apollinaire gives her a disdainful look.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    Nurse, if that were helpful,<br>
    don't you think I would have<br>
    ordered it?</p>
  <p> Beverly has to bite her tongue.</p>

  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    Now, you finish the charts and<br>
    leave the practice of medicine<br>
    to me.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> He moves to one end of the ward; Beverly moves toward<br>
    Troi and Geordi, who are talking with a MALE PATIENT.<br>
    Beverly slips her tricorder out of a pocket, and, as<br>
    she studies a chart, surreptitiously scans the area.</p>
  <p>10A ON GEORDI AND TROI</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    ... did your friend have any<br>
    visitors before he died?</p>
  <p> MALE PATIENT<br>
    (weakly)<br>
    No... had no family... only people<br>
    to come were doctor and nurse.</p>
  <p> Troi nods, pat his arm comfortingly and starts to move<br>
    on.</p>
  <p> MALE PATIENT<br>
    Very bad doctor.</p>
  <p> She turns back.</p>
  <p> MALE PATIENT<br>
    Only spent time with one man.<br>
    I ask for water... he ignore me.<br>
    Others cry in pain... doctor does<br>
    not care.<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    Very bad.</p>
  <p> Troi exchanges a glance with Geordi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>11 EXT. INFIRMARY STREET - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker continues his patrol as Picard approaches. He<br>
    is dressed as a workman and carries a tool box.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hello, Officer. This the<br>
    Infirmary?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes. The entrance is right there.</p>
  <p> Riker watches as Picard moves toward the entrance.<br>
    From behind him approach a tall, aristocratic couple, a<br>
    DOCTOR and NURSE. The nurse carries a satchel; the<br>
    doctor carries a cane... carved with a snake's head...<br>
    as they pass Riker, he tips his hat to them. They move<br>
    toward the entrance of the infirmary.</p>
  <p>12 INT. INFIRMARY - A FEW MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Picard is fiddling with one of the gas lamps on the<br>
    wall. Glancing around to make sure no one is watching,<br>
    he inserts a small (TECH DEVICE) inside the lamp, then<br>
    begins to replace the fixture. Doctor Apollinaire<br>
    approaches.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    Just what is it you're doing with<br>
    those lamps?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Replacing the wick screws. City<br>
    ordinance... makes it safer in<br>
    case of an earthquake.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    There hasn't been an earthquake<br>
    here in thirty years.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's it for this ward. Have<br>
    to be moving on.</p>
  <p> He goes toward the door as Apollinaire looks after him,<br>
    shaking his head scornfully.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    Earthquakes...<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Nurse, if you can handle things<br>
    here, I have a meeting with the<br>
    Board of Patrons.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm sure I'll manage.</p>
  <p> He EXITS. Beverly takes out her tricorder and<br>
    continues scanning. She moves toward Troi and Geordi,<br>
    who has now put on his VISOR and is looking around the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (pointing)<br>
    There... by that bed. I can see<br>
    an afterimage of triolic waves.<br>
    They were here recently... within<br>
    the last twenty-four hours.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (noting the bed)<br>
    That's the bed where someone died<br>
    last night...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (pointing to the male<br>
    patient)<br>
    This man was complaining about<br>
    a strange doctor and nurse who<br>
    visited that patient.<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    They might still be in the<br>
    hospital.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods and Troi and Geordi EXIT. Beverly<br>
    continues scanning... when suddenly one of the patients<br>
    goes into labored breathing. She is at his side in a<br>
    moment... checks pulse and pupils.</p>

    quickly mixes two vials together, returns to the bed<br>
    and tilts the man's head up so he can sip.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This will make you more<br>
    comfortable...</p>
  <p> The man swallows, falls back on the pillow. Beverly<br>
    begins to sponge his brow.</p>
  <p>13 ANGLE - ON DOOR</p>
  <p> as it opens and the tall, silent Alien Doctor and Nurse<br>
    ENTER the ward. Beverly is working with the man at<br>
    the other end of the room, her back toward them. The<br>
    couple moves quickly to the bedside of a patient.</p>
  <p>13A ON THE GAS LAMP</p>
  <p> As a tiny red light begins to blink.</p>
  <p>14 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> ministers to her patient... then hears the muffled<br>
    sound of her tricorder. She looks up toward the gas<br>
    lamp and sees --</p>

  <p> The Alien Nurse lifts the satchel and points it right<br>
    toward Beverly, who doesn't know exactly what it will<br>
    do, but can guess. Riker comes plunging through the<br>
    door, phaser drawn.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold it!</p>
  <p> The aliens whirl to see him... he's followed by Picard,<br>
    Geordi (wearing his VISOR), and Troi with phasers. The<br>
    Alien Doctor moves toward Geordi, lifting the cane to<br>
    strike him with it, but --</p>

  <p> grabs the cane with one hand and kicks the alien. The<br>
    Alien Doctor reacts in rage, and lunges back toward<br>
    Geordi; Riker gets off a phaser BLAST in between Geordi<br>
    and the Alien Doctor, who stops in his tracks. He<br>
    reaches out for the Alien Nurse and they --</p>
  <p>19 ALIEN COUPLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> crackle with the blue EFFECT of phase-shifting and<br>
    vanish. There is the SOUND of windows breaking. Our<br>
    group looks around, stunned. It's all happened so<br>
    fast. Outside, there are voices reacting to the<br>
    commotion, shouting, etc. Some patients react.</p>
  <p>20 INT. DATA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUTTING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data moves to his contraption, which is sounding an<br>
    alarm, registering something like a seismograph. Data<br>
    quickly unrolls a map and checks a location with the<br>
    readings on the machine. Then he hurries for the door.</p>
  <p>21 INT. INFIRMARY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> An orderly runs in, followed by Doctor Apollinaire.<br>

    upset... we tried to calm her but<br>
    she ran out.</p>
  <p> DOCTOR APOLLINAIRE<br>
    I heard an explosion...</p>
  <p> The group looks innocently mystified.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Okay, folks, I suggest you all<br>
    clear out and let the patients<br>
    have a little peace... sorry,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> Apollinaire nods, trusting in the firm hand of the law.<br>
    But at that moment, in runs another policeman -- this<br>
    one legitimate.</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    People said there was gunfire in<br>
    here... What's going on?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just a misunderstanding... I'm<br>
    clearing these people out of here.</p>
  <p> The others start for the door as the policeman studies<br>
    Riker.</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    I've never seen you before...</p>

    I'm going to ask all of you to<br>
    come down to the station for<br>
    questioning.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Including you. Let's go...</p>
  <p> He spots the cane which Geordi holds.</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    Where'd you get that? That's a<br>
    gentleman's cane.</p>
  <p> He takes it from Geordi, inspects it with a knowing eye<br>
    -- this is valuable.</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    Never saw a cane like this before.<br>
    (tucks it under his arm)<br>
    I'll have to confiscate it.<br>
    Evidence.</p>
  <p> Riker and Picard exchange glances. Riker steps toward<br>
    the policeman.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I want you to know... I have only<br>
    the greatest respect for the law.</p>
  <p> And he decks him. Riker grabs the cane and the group<br>
    runs for it (Geordi quickly putting his VISOR back on).<br>
    The fallen policeman pulls his whistle and blows.</p>
  <p>22 EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> as they hurry out of the infirmary, they hear other<br>
    police whistles blowing. Police are hurrying, on foot,<br>
    toward them.</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE - DATA IN CARRIAGE</p>
  <p> Rushing toward them is a horse-drawn carriage driven<br>
    by Data. The group reacts in amazement.</p>

    (climbing in)<br>
    Agreed. Let's get out of here.</p>
  <p> As the policeman from inside the infirmary runs out,<br>
    they all quickly pile on and Data starts the horse up<br>
    again. The carriage charges up the street, past the<br>

  <p> Picard nods, and Geordi sets his phaser, then<br>
    carefully fires a gentle burst -- not directly at the<br>
    cane -- which creates a field. It envelops the cane,<br>

    What the...</p>

    Minute space-time distortions...<br>
    like the one we saw on Devidia<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    But they were so small... and<br>
    they only lasted a second...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The aliens seem to have the<br>
    ability to concentrate the<br>
    distortion -- and direct it toward<br>
    a specific time and destination.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe they have something... a<br>
    -- mechanism, that focuses it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Any device like that would produce<br>
    significant levels of triolic<br>

  <p> Before he can finish, there's a knock at the door.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE<br>
    Mister Picard!</p>
  <p> The group exchanges glances... they still don't have<br>
    the rent money. No one responds.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL'S VOICE<br>
    I know you're in there! Open the<br>
    door!</p>
  <p> Picard makes a silent gesture to the others; they go in<br>
    to a pre-arranged plan. Geordi removes his VISOR and<br>
    puts on the dark glasses.</p>

  <p>28 ON TROI</p>
  <p> as she walks toward the door, opens it and smiles at<br>
    Mrs. Carmichael.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Mrs. Carmichael... thank goodness<br>
    you're here.</p>
  <p> And before Mrs. Carmichael can speak, Troi pulls her<br>
    in. Over this, we hear:</p>
  <p> DATA/PUCK<br>
    How now, spirit! whither wander<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY/FAIRY<br>
    Over hill, over dale, Through<br>
    bush, through brier, Over park,<br>
    over pale...</p>
  <p>29 ANGLE - THE GROUP</p>
  <p> Data, Riker, and Beverly are in a &quot;rehearsal&quot; of<br>
    Midsummer Night's Dream; Picard is the director. He<br>
    turns and, seeing Mrs. Carmichael, gestures grandly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah -- just in time! We need<br>
    someone to read a part...</p>
  <p> He presses a playbook in her hands, points to a<br>
    passage.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    Mister Picard, I need to be<br>
    talkin' to you...</p>
  <p> Ignoring her, Picard waves at Oberon to begin.</p>

    Now, Mrs. Carmichael...<br>
    (points insistently)<br>
    Right there...</p>
  <p> RIKER/OBERON<br>
    (again)<br>
    Ill met by moonlight, proud<br>
    Titania.</p>
  <p> Mrs. Carmichael looks at Picard, perplexed, and at the<br>
    book. She takes a breath.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    (woodenly - awful)<br>
    What, jealous Oberon. Fairies<br>
    skip hence. I have foresworn his<br>
    bed and company.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I don't need to hear any<br>
    more. That was -- truly unique.</p>
  <p> She glances up at him.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think we've found our Titania...<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    ... don't you agree?</p>
  <p> The group responds with nods and murmurs of<br>
    appreciation.</p>

  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    Well... I did do a church play<br>
    when I was a lass...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You see? We'll begin rehearsals<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> A long pause.</p>
  <p> MRS. CARMICHAEL<br>
    What theatre did you say?</p>
  <p>30 EXT. VICTORIAN BOARDING HOUSE - SAME DAY</p>
  <p> The carriage in which the crew made their escape<br>
    stands in front of the boarding house. The Alien<br>
    Doctor and Nurse walk slowly toward it, look at it,<br>
    and exchange glances... this is the one. Then they<br>
    walk slowly on by.</p>
  <p>30A INT. DATA'S HOTEL ROOM</p>
  <p> Guinan is there, pacing. She hears a key in the lock<br>
    and whirls toward the door. It opens and Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    There you are! I have good news<br>
    -- we can get into the Presidio<br>
    --</p>
  <p> She stops as Picard, close on Data's heels, ENTERS<br>
    also.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is all right.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles at the sight of this nineteenth century<br>
    Guinan in her finery. But of course she doesn't know<br>
    him, and addresses Data.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    General Mallory is usually a<br>
    stickler for the rules... but I<br>
    happen to know that his wife<br>
    thinks she's a singer. So I told<br>
    him she simply must perform at<br>
    my next gathering... and the rules<br>
    just... disappeared.</p>
  <p> She feels Picard's look, and turns to him, regards him<br>
    curiously.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You know me...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>30A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Do I know you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not yet. But you will.</p>
  <p> She scrutinizes him carefully... there is an instant<br>
    chemistry between them, in this, their true first<br>
    meeting.</p>
  <p>31 EXT. INFIRMARY STREET - SAME DAY</p>
  <p> Start on Clemens, standing among a few by-standers,<br>
    chomping his cigar and listening to the end of a<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    Thanks for your help, Officer.</p>
  <p> POLICEMAN<br>
    Make sure you put in the part<br>
    about me spotting that phony<br>
    policeman.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    Yessir, I will.</p>
  <p> The Young Reporter turns away and starts reading<br>
    through his notes; Clemens saunters up to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/10/92 - ACT THREE 35.</p>

  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    H'lo, son...</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    (a little surprised)<br>
    Mister Clemens... what brings you<br>
    here?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    A writer's curiosity...</p>
  <p> He glances around to see if they're being overheard,<br>
    moves a little closer to the reporter.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I heard two people vanished into<br>
    thin air in this Infirmary.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    (checking pad)<br>
    One of the patients said that,<br>
    yessir. But the police deny it.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I'll bet they do...</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    They say a band of outlaws set<br>
    off an explosion in the<br>
    hospital... then escaped.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    What did these outlaws look like?</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    (reading)<br>
    The carriage they escaped in was<br>
    driven by an albino...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Ah. Mister Data.</p>
  <p> The reporter stares at him.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    You know him?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    You bet I do. You say there<br>
    were others with him?</p>

    Yes -- at least a dozen.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    His accomplices... they've come<br>
    from the future -- my God, it's<br>
    an invasion.</p>
  <p> The reporter is increasingly amazed. Clemens turns<br>
    away to hail a carriage. The reporter follows.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    An invasion... from the future?<br>
    Mister Clemens... what can you<br>
    tell me about this? Do you have<br>
    any proof?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Young man... when's your deadline?</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    Five o'clock, sir.</p>

  <p>31 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Clemens enters the carriage, pulls out his pocket watch<br>
    (the one seen in Part I).</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I'll meet you at your paper at<br>
    four-thirty... with a story that<br>
    will make your career.</p>
  <p> YOUNG REPORTER<br>
    Thanks, Mister Clemens...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Take me to the Presidio, driver.<br>
    And don't spare the whip.</p>
  <p>32 INT. CAVERN - LATER</p>
  <p> Geordi and Riker are in one tunnel of the cavern, using<br>
    their tricorders.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The triolic levels are as high<br>
    as they were on Devidia Two...<br>
    (lowers tricorder)<br>
    ... but no indication of any<br>
    control mechanism.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not so sure.</p>
  <p> Geordi is peering at the cavern walls through his<br>
    VISOR.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My VISOR is picking up crystalline<br>
    fractures. These cavern walls<br>
    have undergone some kind of<br>
    selective molecular polarization.</p>
  <p> He moves along the wall, still peering intently.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In fact, if I'm right... this<br>
    whole cavern has been configured<br>
    to focus the space-time<br>
    distortion... just like a lens.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT THREE 36A.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They have reached the part of the cavern where the<br>
    others are scanning.</p>
  <p>32A ANOTHER PART OF THE CAVERN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Troi, Beverly (glasses still in pocket),<br>
    Data, and Guinan; all but the latter are scanning.<br>
    Geordi and Riker join them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, we think we're on to<br>
    something. The cavern itself<br>
    seems to be acting as a focusing<br>
    mechanism... and I'm betting the<br>
    same is true of their habitat<br>
    back on Devidia Two.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If we can get back there... and<br>
    destroy that site... can we put<br>
    an end to their time<br>
    traveling... ?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have the ophidian...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But I don't know if it will work.<br>
    The energy our phasers generate<br>
    may not be entirely compatible<br>
    with the ophidian.</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates for only an instant.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have no choice but to try.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS' VOICE<br>
    An event I would most certainly<br>
    enjoy witnessing...</p>

  <p> CLEMENS<br>

    Move along... I suspect even<br>
    time travellers are vulnerable<br>
    to a Colt Forty-Five.<br>
    (removes watch, glances<br>
    at it)<br>
    Let's go -- I've made a young<br>
    fellow a promise and I don't want<br>
    to be late.</p>
  <p> But before anyone can move, there is a blue phasing<br>
    EFFECT -- and the Alien Doctor and Nurse phase in...<br>
    the others don't have a chance to react when the Alien<br>
    Doctor snatches the cane from Troi.</p>
  <p>33 ANGLE - THE ALIENS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> They activate the snake just as Data dives at them with<br>
    his super speed -- he grabs for the snake just as it<br>
    flares into action... there is a sonic boom and a hole<br>
    of blinding white light begins to open -- right in<br>
    Data's body.</p>
  <p>34 DATA'S BODY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> disappears, his head goes flying off and onto the<br>
    cavern floor...</p>
  <p>35 GUINAN AND CLEMENS</p>
  <p> are flung backwards by the force of the opening...<br>
    Guinan striking her head on a rock outcropping and<br>
    falling unconscious... Clemens' pistol and watch go<br>
    flying...</p>
  <p>36 ANGLE - THE GROUP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Alien Nurse has been wounded and is lying on the<br>
    ground. The Alien Doctor hesitates briefly... then<br>
    plunges through the hole.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to the others)<br>
    Follow him!</p>
  <p> Riker, Geordi, Troi, and Beverly hurry through the<br>
    hole; Picard starts after them, then stops and looks<br>
    back at Guinan. He goes to her, kneels by her side,<br>
    realizing she's badly hurt, feeling her pulse.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's Arrow, Pt. 2&quot; - 7/02/92 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>37 CLEMENS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> stands up, staring at the time hole through which the<br>
    others have vanished. He hesitates for an instant,<br>
    glances at Picard, and then, as the hole is beginning<br>
    to close, he dashes forward and jumps through. The<br>
    hole closes. The cavern is quiet. Picard is now<br>
    trapped in the 19th century.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>38 EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As seen in Part I, but not phase-shifted (i.e., we<br>
    don't see the aliens or their environment.) The group<br>
    is picking themselves up, shaking off the effects of<br>
    the violent transport.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is everybody all right?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think so...</p>
  <p> She pulls her tricorder... begins checking... and then<br>
    Riker sees Clemens.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You--!</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    (rising to his feet,<br>
    brushing himself off)<br>
    Where are we -- and when is this?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's the twenty-fourth century...<br>
    this is Devidia Two -- and you<br>
    shouldn't be here.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Seems to me I have as much right<br>
    to be in your time as you had to<br>
    be in mine. You see, sir, I<br>
    wanted to see how you've conducted<br>
    my future affairs.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your future affairs?</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    The affairs of mankind.</p>

  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    You have been off sensor displays<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Commander...</p>
  <p> They move to see that Geordi has found Data's body...<br>

    Security? What for?</p>
  <p> At this point, the door slides open and WORF ENTERS.<br>
    Clemens stares at him, astonished.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    A werewolf...</p>
  <p> But Worf is no less astonished at this array of people<br>
    garbed in 19th century clothing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a long story, Mister Worf...<br>
    I'll brief you later.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Transporter Chief)<br>
    Have Data's body brought to the<br>
    Medical Lab. I'm going to try<br>
    to re-attach the head we have.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    That head is almost five hundred<br>

    I want Mister Clemens here under<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Commander... perhaps I could<br>
    handle that. I'd be happy to take<br>
    Mister Clemens to quarters.</p>
  <p> Riker realizes Troi is offering to make things smoother<br>
    for this unexpected monkey wrench, and is grateful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good idea.<br>
    (to Clemens)<br>
    If you would accompany the<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> Clemens regards her. A handsome woman, indeed.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Madame... I'd be delighted.</p>
  <p> He offers her his arm and Troi takes it; they move<br>
    toward the door.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    So this is a space ship, eh? Did<br>
    you ever run into Halley's comet?</p>
  <p>40 INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH</p>
  <p> Picard is with Guinan... he has bandaged her head with<br>
    material from her cape (or something). She is<br>
    regaining consciousness... tries to sit up.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Whoa... everything's spinning...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Don't try to sit up too quickly...<br>
    you've lost a lot of blood.</p>

    You're still here...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You were hurt. I had to make sure<br>
    you were all right.</p>
  <p> She opens her eyes part way, looks at him.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You stayed here... for that... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can't very well let anything<br>
    happen to you... you're far too<br>
    important to me.</p>
  <p> Guinan smiles faintly... she is fading.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You know... so much about me...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Believe me, in the future the<br>
    tables will be turned.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    We... become friends...</p>

    It goes beyond friendship.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    But... I have to wait... almost<br>
    five hundred years...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And when we meet... I won't be<br>
    able to tell you about this, will<br>
    I?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Because for me, it won't have<br>
    happened yet.</p>
  <p> She smiles, shaking her head at this puzzlement. As<br>
    she does, she spots Data's head on the floor of the<br>
    cavern.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    What happened... ?</p>

    You were there, in the cavern.<br>

  <p> She gazes at him, implacable. She is silent. His<br>
    frustration mounts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Damn it, Guinan, don't play games<br>
    with me... I need answers.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    If I tell you what happened in<br>
    that cavern, it would affect any<br>
    decision you're about to make.<br>
    I can't do that. I won't do that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not telling me might affect my<br>
    decision, too... did you think<br>
    of that?</p>
  <p> She does not respond. Riker leans in to her,<br>
    frustrated.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    Picard. I'm not going to sit<br>

    out... I've got to do something...</p>
  <p> He waits, hoping she'll relent. But she holds his gaze<br>

  <p> Riker, Worf, others.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, Commander La Forge has<br>
    completed the re-configuration<br>
    of the photon torpedoes.</p>
  <p> Riker hesitates. He doesn't want to have to fire.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>55A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If Clemens got back, the Captain<br>
    should have been here by now.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have no way of knowing if<br>
    Mister Clemens was successful.</p>
  <p> Another silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Re-establish your firing pattern,<br>
    Mister Worf. We'll wait five more<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Commander.</p>

  <p> Clemens with Guinan and Picard.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    No time for chit-chat, sir...<br>
    (hands Picard the cane)<br>
    According to Mister La Forge --<br>
    who did get your message by the<br>
    way -- a frequency setting of<br>
    point-oh-four-seven on your phaser<br>
    will correctly activate this<br>
    creature.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You'll have to get help. Guinan<br>
    needs medical attention...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    I promise you she will be attended<br>
    to.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We have a bill at Mrs.<br>
    Carmichael's boarding house --</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    It will be settled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Thank you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I wish time had allowed me to know<br>
    you better...</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    You'll just have to read my books.<br>
    What I am is pretty much there.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Guinan...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    I'll see you in five hundred<br>
    years, Picard.</p>
  <p> He smiles at her...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll see you... in a few minutes.</p>
  <p> And on their looks --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>56 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data sees something on his sensors.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander... I am picking up<br>
    massive triolic wave activity on<br>
    the surface.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (instantly alert)<br>
    Is it the Captain?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are no human life signs.</p>
  <p> Riker frowns... what does this new wrinkle mean?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No sign of a temporal distortion?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. But triolic activity<br>
    is increasing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (resigned)<br>
    The aliens...</p>
  <p> Riker realizes he cannot wait.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister Worf, are the photons<br>
    ready?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Fire.</p>
  <p>56A EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as four torpedoes are projected from the ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/09/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>56B INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> as before.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Torpedoes away, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander -- I am detecting a<br>
    temporal distortion on the<br>
    surface... and human life signs.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts with alarm.</p>

    57</p>
  <p>58 EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, groggy and disoriented, lies on the ground.</p>
  <p> Suddenly an EXPLOSION rips through the chamber,<br>
    illuminating it in a white light. As the light floods<br>
    the area, we can see the shapes of the aliens, their<br>
    phased world revealed from the effect of the<br>
    re-configured torpedoes. Almost immediately that world<br>
    shimmers out.</p>
  <p>59 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    O'Brien -- get him out of there!</p>
  <p>59A EXT. PLANET SURFACE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, jarred by the explosion, is groggily awake...<br>
    almost immediately, the transporter EFFECT shimmers on<br>
    him -- and then there is an overwhelming EXPLOSION: the<br>
    light is a brilliant white that completely wipes the<br>
    screen.</p>
  <p>59B INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Transporter Room -- do you have<br>
    him?</p>
  <p> A beat, then --</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    He does indeed, Commander. And<br>
    believe me... it's good to be<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>59B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We have destroyed the target, sir.<br>
    There is no further indication<br>
    of triolic activity.</p>
  <p> Riker lets out a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign, lay in a course to the<br>
    nearest Starbase. Warp six.</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46001.3.</p>
  <p>62A INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS... spots Guinan behind the bar... walks<br>
    to her and sits down. She gives him a smile... he<br>
    smiles back. There are no words spoken, but the<br>
    reunion of good friends is a poignant one. Over this:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Time's... , Pt. 2&quot; - REV. 7/08/92 - ACT FIVE 61A.</p>
  <p>62A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Everyone who should be in the<br>
    nineteenth century is safely<br>
    there, and those who should be<br>
    in the twenty-fourth are here.<br>
    Mister Data has been restored to<br>
    us, head and all... and Samuel<br>
    Clemens will write the books he<br>
    was to have written after our<br>
    encounter.</p>
  <p>63 INT. CAVERN - 19TH CENTURY EARTH</p>
  <p> A pair of litter-bearers are carrying Guinan out of the<br>
    cavern. Clemens looks down at her.</p>
  <p> CLEMENS<br>
    Be careful not to jostle her too<br>
    much, boys...<br>
    (to Guinan)<br>
    Don't worry... you're going to<br>
    be fine...</p>
  <p> He watches as she is carried past him... then he turns<br>
    and looks back into the interior of the cavern. His<br>
    eye is caught by something on the ground.</p>
  <p> He moves forward, stoops... and picks up his watch,<br>
    fallen there after the time-hole was opened. He opens<br>
    it... looks at it... snaps it shut and starts to put it<br>
    in his pocket.</p>
  <p> But then he reconsiders. The watch... like the gun and<br>
    the glasses, and Data's head, must remain here, if<br>
    history is to remain intact. He puts the watch back on<br>
    the ground... looks around again, then turns and EXITS.</p>
  <p> Camera DRIFTS into the cavern... into a darkened<br>
    corner... and we see Data's HEAD... waiting to be<br>
    discovered again five hundred years in the future.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
