    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46461.3.<br>
    The Enterprise has entered the<br>
    Ipai Sector, where we are<br>
    scheduled to deliver supplies to<br>
    a remote communication relay<br>
    station near the Klingon border.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it pulls up to a SUBSPACE RELAY STATION. The<br>
    station is small compared to the Enterprise, with<br>
    several exotic-looking antennae sticking out of it.</p>
  <p>4 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, WORF, N.D.'S. Worf reacts to his<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Station forty-seven is still not<br>
    responding to our hails, Captain.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at his armchair console.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Should be two people aboard.<br>
    Lieutenants Aquiel Uhnari... and<br>
    Keith Rocha.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - 11/05/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is difficult to scan through<br>
    the concentrated subspace signals.</p>
  <p> Picard sends a look to Riker -- no words are necessary.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (on the move)<br>
    Mister Worf...</p>
  <p> As Worf and Riker head for the Turbolift...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 INT. RELAY STATION - OPS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Geordi and BEVERLY MATERIALIZE in the<br>
    small room, which is crowded with various consoles and<br>
    communications equipment. The SOUND of unattended<br>
    subspace MESSAGES can be heard playing -- a cacophony<br>
    of voices and signals and static -- weird and<br>
    disorienting. They react to the noise.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is that noise?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (over the din)<br>
    They must've left the audio<br>
    monitoring system on! We're<br>
    hearing a few thousand subspace<br>
    messages! I'll try to shut it<br>
    off!</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to a nearby console and starts to work.<br>
    Riker and Worf begin to look around the room, while<br>
    Beverly scans with a tricorder. There are no people in<br>
    sight...</p>
  <p>6 WORF</p>
  <p> stops at a door. He touches a control on the wall and<br>
    the doors slide OPEN... he enters the unseen room.</p>
  <p>7 GEORDI</p>
  <p> continues to work the console. Finally, the subspace<br>
    messages STOP playing. He breathes a sigh of relief,<br>
    turns to join the others...</p>
  <p> And hesitates, hearing something. He listens intently.<br>
    There is a faint THUMPING sound coming from somewhere<br>
    nearby.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> Riker walks over and Geordi motions toward the<br>
    direction of the sound. They follow the thumping noise<br>
    across the room... down along a wall... and toward a<br>
    service duct OPENING near the floor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's coming from inside this<br>
    service duct... could be a loose<br>
    cover plate...</p>
  <p> Riker kneels down beside the small entrance. The<br>
    thumping grows LOUDER. Riker and Geordi exchange a<br>
    mystified look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker carefully looks into the service duct...</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE IN SERVICE DUCT</p>
  <p> A medium-sized female DOG is sitting in the shaft, her<br>
    tail wagging, thumping against the metal.</p>
  <p>9 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> The dog comes out of the duct and licks Riker's face.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Here's your loose cover plate...</p>
  <p> Geordi kneels down to pet the dog.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hey there, pooch...</p>
  <p> Worf returns from the quarters.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The shuttlecraft is gone. There<br>
    is no one aboard.</p>
  <p> Beverly calls to them from offscreen --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (O.S.)<br>
    Commander...</p>
  <p> They move to join her...</p>
  <p>10 BEVERLY</p>
  <p> is kneeling in a remote corner of the room, scanning a<br>
    section of the floor with her tricorder. There are<br>
    smears of BLOOD on a nearby console. Several pieces of<br>
    equipment are overturned. Evidence of a struggle.<br>
    They react as they see that something's happened here.</p>
  <p> Beverly indicates an area of the floor she is scanning --<br>
    a three foot square section which has been MELTED and<br>
    is surrounded by nasty-looking scorch marks. Blood and<br>
    a dark, hardened FLUID can been seen mixed in with the<br>
    twisted metal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: the stain)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Cellular residue... I think it's<br>
    the remains of one of our<br>
    Lieutenants.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> holding position near the relay station.</p>
  <p>12 INT. RELAY STATION - OPS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf and an N.D. are working near the damaged section<br>
    of floor. Worf is using a PHASER to cut out the<br>
    section of deckplate which has been melted.</p>
  <p>13 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly are standing at the scene of the<br>
    struggle. Geordi is working at a console in the<br>
    background.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All of the blood traces I found<br>
    match Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.</p>
  <p> She indicates the section of melted deckplate.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    For now I'll assume these are her<br>
    remains... but I'll need to take<br>
    the deckplate back to Sickbay to<br>
    make sure.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It would take a powerful weapon to<br>
    do this...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll have a better idea after I've<br>
    analyzed the deckplate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - 11/05/92 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the deckplate a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If that is Lieutenant Uhnari...<br>
    Where's Rocha?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The station's shuttle is gone.<br>
    Maybe he took it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Before Uhnari died... or after?</p>
  <p> They consider this mystery for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/10/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>14 WORF AND N.D. (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf finishes cutting with the phaser. He and the N.D.<br>
    pick up the melted section of deckplate and set it<br>
    aside.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We're ready, Commander.</p>
  <p>15 RIKER</p>
  <p> nods and moves to Geordi. The dog is sitting at<br>
    Geordi's feet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any luck downloading the station<br>
    logs?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not yet. I can't get past the<br>
    security lock-outs.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I think I know why...</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates a monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All encrypted subspace messages<br>
    are sent through this channel.<br>
    Look at the signal notation...</p>
  <p> Riker looks for a moment.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's out of sequence.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    I'd say somebody tried to by-pass<br>
    the access protocol and break into<br>
    the coded messages. It caused the<br>
    security lock-outs to freeze up.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are there any messages missing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I won't know until I can get into<br>
    the files.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to pick up his equipment case. The dog<br>
    follows him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - 11/05/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm going to try accessing the<br>
    logs from another console.</p>
  <p> Riker nods, eyes the dog.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: dog)<br>
    Looks like you've made a friend.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah...</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles, gives the dog a friendly pat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're going back to the ship. Let<br>
    me know as soon as you have<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Riker joins Beverly. Worf and the N.D. are holding the<br>
    section of deckplate.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (taps combadge)<br>
    Riker to Enterprise. Four to beam<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to the dog.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come on, girl...</p>
  <p> Geordi grabs a couple of tools and walks across the<br>
    room, as we HEAR the dematerialization, toward a set of<br>
    doors still carrying the computer module. He taps a<br>
    button and the doors SLIDE OPEN...</p>
  <p>16 INT. RELAY STATION - AQUIEL'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Geordi ENTERS with the dog. The room is decorated with<br>
    exotic artwork... various personal items can be seen...<br>
    the bed is unmade. The place is cramped, but it has a<br>
    comfortable, &quot;lived in&quot; look. There is a desk with a<br>
    workstation. Geordi sits down and activates the<br>
    MONITOR -- it shows STATIC.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Geordi now opens a MEES PANEL on the wall, begins to<br>
    adjust the inner-workings with one of his tools. As he<br>
    works, he casually talks to the dog...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    All right... what do you say we<br>
    try repolarizing the interface...</p>
  <p> A beat. Then we HEAR a burst of garbled VOICES and<br>
    STATIC. Geordi glances at the monitor -- it hasn't<br>
    changed. He plugs the computer module into a<br>
    corresponding slot on this terminal.</p>
  <p> From offscreen, the dog WHINES. Surprised, Geordi<br>
    turns to look -- the dog is sitting nearby, staring up<br>
    at a shelf. Geordi stands, moves to the shelf, which<br>
    holds several knick-knacks and a JEWELLED HEADBAND. He<br>
    can't resist picking it up and examining it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: headband)<br>
    This doesn't look like yours...</p>
  <p> Geordi looks on the shelf again and sees a dog's BONE.<br>
    Geordi picks up the bone.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: bone)<br>
    Is this what you're looking for?</p>
  <p> He tosses the bone to the dog, who takes it happily.<br>
    Geordi looks at the headband for another beat then he<br>
    replaces it on the shelf and eyes a few other items on<br>
    the shelf... he's intrigued...</p>
  <p> Geordi returns to the wall panel... makes a final<br>
    adjustment to the circuitry, then taps a control on the<br>
    monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer, run station logs in<br>
    sequence.</p>
  <p> A burst of static -- then we HEAR the VOICE of Aquiel<br>
    Uhnari. The log picks her up in mid-sentence:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/11/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> AQUIEL (V.O.)<br>
    -- Log, Stardate 46458.3. Today<br>
    we configured the relay controller<br>
    grid. It was the last primary<br>
    system we had to overhaul. We are<br>
    scheduled to recalibrate and align<br>
    the antennae systems in the next<br>
    three days.</p>
  <p> The log STOPS. Geordi takes a beat, having been caught<br>
    up by the sound of the woman's voice.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer, access visual output.</p>
  <p> Geordi taps the desktop control -- still no picture.<br>
    STATIC, then Aquiel's VOICE again. She sounds<br>
    irritable.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL (V.O.)<br>
    ... sent in my third request for a<br>
    message delay buffer. Until it<br>
    arrives, Lieutenant Rocha and I<br>
    have rigged a memory module to<br>
    compensate. It'd better work...<br>
    or about a half million subspace<br>
    messages are going to end up<br>
    drifting through space.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Computer, open Uhnari<br>
    correspondence file.</p>
  <p> A burst of STATIC, then silence.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer... access correspondence<br>
    files... Lieutenant Aquiel Uhnari.</p>
  <p> A brief silence, then STATIC. Geordi works the<br>
    controls.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>16 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> AQUIEL (V.O.)<br>
    Hello, Shianna. Sorry I haven't<br>
    talked to you in a while... but<br>
    I've been dealing with the new<br>
    Lieutenant, Rocha. So far he's<br>
    been rude, arrogant, and<br>
    condescending -- and he's only<br>
    been here two days. This might be<br>
    a long year...</p>
  <p> More STATIC... Geordi works the controls.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come on, Lieutenant... stick with<br>
    me...</p>
  <p> Aquiel's VOICE comes in clearly again, mid-log. There<br>
    is a strained quality to her voice this time -- she's<br>
    upset about something.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL (V.O.)<br>
    -- I had the dream again. Mother<br>
    is calling out my name... she's<br>
    somewhere in the house... I get to<br>
    the top of the hill all right...<br>
    but then the house is slanted...<br>
    I'm still walking uphill. I can't<br>
    find her... doors everywhere and<br>
    they all look the same...</p>
  <p> The log ENDS. A beat as Geordi absorbs what he's<br>
    heard. He starts to work at the wall panel<br>
    circuitry...</p>
  <p> As he works...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The section of deckplate is sitting on a table in the<br>
    center of the room. The DONUT has been placed over the<br>
    deckplate. From beneath the donut can be seen SMALL<br>
    BEAMS which are SCANNING the leading edge of the metal.<br>
    Thin WISPS of SMOKE are coming up from where the beams<br>
    touch it.</p>
  <p> Beverly and a MEDICAL N.D. are monitoring the armature<br>
    as Picard and Riker look on.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The cellular residue is completely<br>
    fused with the metal of the<br>
    deckplate.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We're trying to micro-vaporize the<br>
    metal... so I can get a clean DNA<br>
    sample.</p>
  <p> They move away from the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Do you have any idea what killed<br>
    her?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well... this is just a guess, but<br>
    from the molecular deposition on<br>
    the plating I'd say it was a highlevel<br>
    phaser blast.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could it have been a Klingon<br>
    disruptor?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Possibly.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi found evidence that the<br>
    encrypted messages might have been<br>
    tampered with.<br>
    (with import)<br>
    We're pretty close to Klingon<br>
    space...</p>

    Geordi makes a final adjustment to the panel, then<br>
    glances at the monitor screen -- still STATIC.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Alright... let's try this again...</p>
  <p> He makes another adjustment, looks at the screen --<br>

    on the monitor. After a beat, the image COMES TO LIFE<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Hello, Shianna. By the time you<br>
    get this... the Batarael will be<br>
    over. This is the first year I<br>
    haven't been there... I've been<br>
    wondering who's singing the Horath<br>
    in my place...</p>
  <p> Aquiel is silent a moment... then she begins to SING a<br>
    soft and beautiful alien melody, which obviously has<br>
    special meaning for her. Geordi sits back and listens,<br>
    entranced by the singing.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>

    Jomiael Batarael... &quot;</p>
  <p> Over this, Geordi stands and begins to eye various<br>
    personal items on the shelf -- exotic figurines, books,<br>
    etc. He stops at a nightstand. An open BOOK is lying<br>
    face down on the table, along with a half empty glass<br>
    of liquid. Geordi notes the title of the book: &quot;THE<br>
    FATAL REVENGE.&quot; There's something else on the<br>
    nightstand -- an alien PERFUME BOTTLE. He carefully<br>
    picks it up... removes the stopper... reacts to the<br>
    pleasing fragrance.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>

    &quot;continues to sing song - TBD&quot;</p>
  <p> Geordi turns and glances around the room. His eye<br>

    sitting on a stand by itself. Light SPARKLES on his<br>
    face as he picks it up...</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    (sings)<br>
    &quot;finishes song - TBD&quot;</p>
  <p> Aquiel stops singing, overcome by emotion. She looks<br>
    down for a moment, then back up.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I had the dream again... the one<br>
    where Mother is screaming... I<br>
    climb the hill to our house... but<br>
    I can't get to her...<br>

    Shianna, this time I ran away. I<br>
    was so scared I ran back down the<br>
    hill...</p>
  <p> There is a pause as Aquiel looks down... trying to come<br>
    to grips with her feelings.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I think I know why I've been<br>
    having dreams about danger... it's<br>
    because of what's been happening<br>
    with that Klingon.</p>
  <p> Geordi sits up at the mention of a Klingon.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    He's getting more aggressive all<br>
    the time.</p>
  <p> Geordi works the control for a quick beat. The log<br>
    plays her last couple of sentences again.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    ... it's because of what's been<br>
    happening with that Klingon. He's<br>
    getting more aggressive all the<br>

    danger.<br>

    Shianna, I couldn't say this to<br>
    anyone but you... but... the<br>

  <p> Geordi is reporting to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There are at least three<br>
    references to a Commander Morag --<br>
    a Klingon officer who patrols this<br>
    section of the border. Apparently<br>
    he would pass the station every<br>
    few days and harass them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps Morag was the one<br>
    interested in obtaining the<br>
    encrypted messages.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Could be. She didn't say.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I still have several days worth of<br>
    logs left to watch. Maybe I'll<br>
    learn more.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Shianna, you always said I'd look<br>
    great with a wig. So here it is.<br>

    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Geordi responds as if she were really asking him the<br>
    question.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Definitely not you.</p>
  <p> She laughs and pulls off the wig.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Okay... maybe I'm getting a little<br>
    crazy... you would, too, if you<br>
    were on a relay station in the<br>
    middle of nowhere with no one for<br>
    company except an egomaniac like<br>

    I agreed to handle the com traffic<br>
    of Relay Station one-nine-four<br>
    while they shut down for<br>

  <p> She leans toward camera.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>

    When he finds out... he'll be<br>

  <p> Aquiel sits back, a little calmer after venting a bit.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    It's days like this that I wish I<br>
    was home. You know what I miss?<br>

    Muskan seed punch.<br>

    Real Muskan seed punch. I can get<br>
    it from the replicator... but it's<br>
    not the same. I'd give anything<br>
    for some of the punch Mother used<br>
    to make... with chunks of the<br>
    seeds still in it...</p>
  <p> There's a pause as Aquiel reflects on the past. Her<br>
    mood darkens.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I had the dream again.</p>
  <p> On the computer, there's a strange sound OFF CAMERA.<br>
    Aquiel looks sharply off to her side.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Keith? Is that you?</p>
  <p> A brief pause... and then the computer screen goes to<br>

    I've managed to access all of<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe Rocha didn't make the<br>
    official logs... Uhnari might have<br>
    been responsible for them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't think so. Aquiel was the<br>

    Really. We just found evidence<br>

    make a report, but the past couple of days have been a<br>
    strain on her. A nasty-looking WOUND can be seen on<br>
    her temple. Her uniform is torn. She is fatigued, on<br>
    edge.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    We were running a level two<br>
    diagnostic of the message<br>
    buffer... nothing special. Rocha<br>
    had been on edge all morning, but<br>
    he'd been irritable ever since he<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    He grabbed me... and threw me<br>
    against the port bulkhead... I<br>
    yelled at him to stop, but he<br>
    wouldn't listen. He took me by<br>
    the throat... I broke free and<br>

    I... don't know, sir. Maybe I<br>
    passed out. I'm not even sure how<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I think I cut my head when he<br>

    Your logs said that a Commander<br>
    Morag had been harassing you...<br>
    did you ever let him or any other<br>
    Klingon aboard the station?</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Absolutely not.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    If that is true, then Morag or<br>
    some other Klingon boarded the<br>
    station after she left.<br>
    (to Torak)<br>
    We found Klingon DNA traces aboard<br>
    the station.</p>
  <p> TORAK<br>
    You still try to blame us!</p>

    Commander Morag was harassing the<br>
    station --</p>
  <p> TORAK<br>
    He was doing his job!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Very well. In the interests of<br>

  <p> Torak EXITS with the other Klingon. Once they're gone,<br>

    There is an awkward moment.</p>

    I'll arrange quarters for you.<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... to be honest... when we<br>

  <p> Geordi can't help but laugh. And she smiles, too,<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I'm curious... now that you've met<br>
    me... am I what you expected?</p>
  <p> Geordi regards her, a bit surprised by the question,<br>
    which is completely straightforward and seemingly<br>
    without artifice. He tries to respond in kind.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure. The woman I saw on<br>
    those logs is very complicated.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think there's more to you than<br>
    meets the eye, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    In what way... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Your relationship with Rocha, for<br>
    example. He'd only been there<br>
    five days... but there was already<br>
    a lot of friction... and you<br>
    almost seemed to delight in doing<br>
    things that would upset him. Why<br>
    would you take on extra com<br>
    traffic... when you knew it would<br>
    make him angry?</p>

  <p> She looks up at him, holding his look with her strange<br>
    alien eyes.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Keith Rocha was obnoxious from the<br>
    minute he reported for duty. He<br>
    treated me as though I were<br>
    beneath contempt.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I dealt with him the best way I<br>
    could. I felt like I had to<br>
    battle him just to hold my own.<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    I checked into her record, too.<br>

    Her last posting was on Deriben<br>
    Five. I spoke with her commanding<br>
    officer there. He said she's<br>
    argumentative... quick to take<br>
    offense. He told me that he<br>
    transferred Uhnari to this relay<br>
    station because she was hampering<br>
    their efforts.<br>

    You think she lied?</p>

    not sure. I just think it's<br>
    something we have to consider.</p>
  <p> Picard considers this for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    As of now, we don't have<br>

    We found a type two phaser in your<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The phaser was set to level ten.<br>

    Standard procedure requires that<br>

  <p> Geordi is working at an opened panel near a MONITOR,<br>

    He completes an adjustment, and the monitor COMES TO<br>

    a stardate and additional information. Geordi watches<br>

    I killed no one!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    none.</p>

    Answer their questions.</p>
  <p> Morag shifts uncomfortably in his chair.</p>
  <p> MORAG<br>
    (uncertain)<br>
    Yes...<br>
    (then bolder)<br>
    Yes, I was there. My patrol route<br>
    takes me near the station every<br>
    six days. Three days ago I hailed<br>
    them and there was no response.<br>
    I was... concerned.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander Morag, we have<br>
    discovered that the encrypted<br>
    message bank on the station has<br>
    been tampered with. Our analysis<br>
    indicates that twenty-seven<br>

    Your DNA was also found on the<br>
    message control module.</p>
  <p> Morag jumps to his feet, feigning outrage.</p>
  <p> MORAG<br>
    This is outrageous! We will not<br>
    tolerate these accusations!</p>
  <p> Morag heads for the door, but the Klingon N.D. blocks<br>
    his way. He looks back to Torak for support, but Torak<br>
    is thinking about his own hide.</p>
  <p> TORAK<br>
    This is a... diplomatic matter,<br>
    Morag.<br>

    Yes... I did take the messages...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Did you kill Lieutenant Rocha?</p>
  <p> MORAG<br>
    No. There was no one there. I<br>
    saw blood... and signs of a<br>
    struggle. I took the codes, but<br>
    I killed no one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Governor, we would like Commander<br>
    Morag to remain aboard the<br>
    Enterprise until our investigation<br>
    is complete.</p>
  <p> TORAK<br>
    Take him.</p>
  <p> They all rise. Picard nods to Worf who gestures to a<br>

  <p> AQUIEL<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Have you ever heard of coalescent<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Rare microscopic lifeforms which<br>
    must absorb other organisms in<br>
    order to survive. Now, that's not<br>
    so unusual... but coalescents<br>
    become the organism they've<br>
    absorbed -- right down to the<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    Do you think that is what happened<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There have been reports that these<br>
    organisms can exist on a larger<br>
    scale. What happened to my hand<br>
    seems to support that theory.</p>
  <p> They consider the strange hypothesis.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you saying that Lieutenant<br>
    Rocha was killed by one of these --<br>
    organisms?</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not understand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I've checked the records. Just<br>
    before he was posted to the relay<br>
    station, Rocha served on an<br>
    outpost in the Triona System...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    That's in a remote sector... maybe<br>
    he was absorbed by a coalescent<br>
    during that mission...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    Then... what came aboard the<br>
    station, was actually an organism<br>
    that looked and acted like<br>
    Rocha...</p>
  <p> They consider, grim-faced.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    How often must they change bodies?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The microscopic organisms have a<br>
    cycle of no more than five to ten<br>
    seconds. We can only assume a<br>
    larger, more complex coalescent<br>
    would have a cycle of at least<br>
    several days... or weeks.</p>

  <p> Confused, Morag has no choice. He walks warily out of<br>
    the room, followed by the others.</p>
  <p>55 INT. RELAY STATION - AQUIEL'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Aquiel sets the prism (no longer glowing) back onto the<br>
    table. She takes Geordi's face into her hands... rests<br>
    her cheek against his...</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    You've never been as close to<br>
    someone as you're about to be...<br>
    think of me...</p>
  <p> Geordi concentrates... their mental and emotional<br>
    connection builds...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>56 OMITTED</p>
  <p>57 INT. RELAY STATION - AQUIEL'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Aquiel and Geordi react to the SOUND of someone<br>
    materializing in the other room --</p>
  <p>58 INCLUDE RIKER AND SECURITY N.D.</p>
  <p> as they ENTER the room. Geordi quickly puts on his<br>
    VISOR as Riker points his phaser at Aquiel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Aquiel)<br>
    Step away from him, Lieutenant...<br>
    slowly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it, Commander?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That might not be Lieutenant<br>
    Uhnari...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    What are you saying?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Step away. Now.</p>
  <p> Aquiel backs away, eyes wide. Off Geordi's stunned<br>
    reaction...</p>
  <p>59 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at the relay station.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (v.o.)<br>
    Chief Medical Officer's Log,<br>
    supplemental. Commander Morag and<br>
    Lieutenant Uhnari are being kept<br>
    under close observation. So far,<br>
    no sign of coalescent behavior has<br>
    surfaced.</p>
  <p>60 INT. GEORDI'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker is talking to Geordi, who is sitting in a chair,<br>
    absently petting the dog, Maura.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uhnari and Morag will be<br>
    transferred to a secure medical<br>
    facility at Starbase Two-twelve.<br>
    Maybe we'll know more by the time<br>
    we get there.</p>
  <p> Geordi is subdued. The events of the past few days<br>
    have taken him on an emotional roller coaster.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... maybe...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It might be Morag... there's no<br>
    way to tell...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (not believing it)<br>
    Right...</p>
  <p> There is an awkward silence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Get some rest. This has been a<br>
    tough couple of days...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks...</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Geordi sits there a moment, thoughtful...<br>
    then he moves to his desk and sits down at a computer<br>
    terminal.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- display the<br>
    Engineering duty roster for the<br>
    next three days.</p>
  <p> A beat, then Geordi begins to quietly work at the<br>
    terminal...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p>61 ANGLE - THE DOG (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it steps up behind Geordi and looks at him, WAGGING<br>
    its tail. Geordi doesn't notice the dog... keeps<br>
    working...</p>
  <p> The dog moves to Geordi's feet and BITES at his boot.<br>
    Geordi gently kicks the dog away. A beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/09/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Then the dog bites at his boot again. Geordi glances<br>
    down.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to dog)<br>
    Come on now... stop it...</p>
  <p> He nudges her away and continues to work. The dog<br>
    stands back and stares at him a moment... then it<br>
    begins to quietly GROWL in an eerie way.</p>
  <p> Geordi keeps working, oblivious to the dog. Then he<br>
    finally hears the growling... turns toward the dog...<br>
    sees it growling and stands, alarmed.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maura... ?</p>
  <p> Without warning, the dog TRANSFORMS into a DARK,<br>
    TERRIFYING, FLUID-LOOKING CREATURE which rears up and<br>
    moves at Geordi -- it's the coalescent creature.</p>
  <p> Geordi reacts, shocked, and leaps out of the way. The<br>
    creature goes after him, roaring --</p>
  <p> Geordi scrambles out of the way as the creature makes<br>
    several frightening LUNGES toward him. He runs into a<br>
    table and almost falls -- manages to stay on his feet,<br>
    only to find himself being backed into a corner as the<br>
    creature moves inexorably closer...</p>
  <p> The creature makes a final LUNGE. Geordi jumps toward<br>
    a nearby desk -- opens a drawer and grabs out a phaser.<br>
    He aims at the creature and FIRES --</p>
  <p> The creature is JOLTED back -- but quickly recovers and<br>
    moves to attack again, roaring, furious.</p>
  <p>61A INSERT - PHASER</p>
  <p> as Geordi rapidly taps the phaser, adjusting the force<br>
    setting to level fourteen.</p>
  <p>61B RESUME</p>
  <p> as Geordi aims and FIRES at the creature with an<br>
    intense, sustained BURST. The creature DISINTEGRATES<br>
    in a FLASH OF LIGHT. Gone.</p>
  <p> OFF Geordi's startled reaction...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/05/92 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>62 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse.</p>
  <p>63 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Geordi and Aquiel are sitting at one of the tables.<br>
    Aquiel is trying to make sense of everything that has<br>
    happened.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe the reason you don't<br>
    remember what happened after Rocha<br>
    attacked you... is that the<br>
    coalescing process had begun...<br>
    remember you felt like the<br>
    memories had been drained right<br>
    out of you? That's probably just<br>
    what happened...</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Then... maybe I did take the<br>
    phaser...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Whatever happened, at least you<br>
    got away.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    So he turned on Maura.</p>
  <p> There is a small silence as they sip their drinks...<br>
    not quite knowing where to take the conversation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well. What now?</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    I guess I'll be going to Starbase<br>
    Two-Twelve for re-assignment.</p>
  <p> Another silence.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (trying to be casual)<br>
    You know... I had a talk with<br>
    Chief Pendleton in Communications.<br>
    There's an opening for a level two<br>
    specialist.</p>
  <p> She stares at him, surprised.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Aquiel&quot; - REV. 11/05/92 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Really?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm sure there's a waiting list so<br>
    long I'd be grey before I got<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off-hand)<br>
    I could put in a good word.</p>
  <p> She eyes him... understanding what he's saying, and<br>
    appreciating it... but needing to stay her own person.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    It's an appealing offer...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I think I'd rather get here on<br>
    my own merits.</p>
  <p> He smiles... it's exactly what he expected her to<br>
    say... and he wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
  <p> AQUIEL<br>
    Don't be surprised if you see my<br>
    name at the end of that list.</p>
  <p> They share a look... which holds promise for the<br>
    future.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
