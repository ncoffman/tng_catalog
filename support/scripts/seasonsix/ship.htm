    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. THE SITTING ROOM - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at 221B Baker Street (as seen in &quot;Elementary, Dear<br>
    Data&quot;). DATA is dressed as Sherlock Holmes and GEORDI<br>
    as Doctor Watson. Watson, and a cigar smoking<br>
    GENTLEMAN of about fifty, listen as Data/Holmes paces<br>
    the room spinning out a trail of deductions.</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    (to the gentleman)<br>
    -- it was then that I began to<br>
    suspect that your brother did not<br>
    die by his own hand... that he was<br>
    in fact... murdered.</p>
  <p> GENTLEMAN<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    Murdered?</p>
  <p> GEORDI/WATSON<br>
    But Holmes, the vial of poison<br>
    found in his hand?</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    That was the first clue, Watson.<br>
    The vial contained strychnine,<br>
    which as you well know induces<br>
    violent muscular spasms. It is<br>
    difficult to imagine that someone<br>
    in the throes of so gruesome a<br>
    death could have held on to so<br>
    delicate a container without<br>
    shattering it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI/WATSON<br>
    You mean... ?</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    Exactly! The vial was placed in<br>
    his hand after he died.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data slams his pipe into his mouth and bites down on it<br>
    for emphasis.</p>
  <p> GEORDI/WATSON<br>
    Then what did kill him?</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    The cigar, of course.</p>
  <p> GENTLEMAN<br>
    (coughing on his own)<br>
    Cigar?</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    Upon closer inspection of the room<br>
    where your brother was found, I<br>
    discovered a fresh burn mark on<br>
    the carpet. Analysis of the ash<br>
    revealed that the cigar was laced<br>
    with strychnine.</p>
  <p> GENTLEMAN<br>
    This is utter nonsense. What<br>
    about the suicide note? It was<br>
    written in my dear brother's own<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    With practice, handwriting can be<br>
    forged.</p>
  <p> Data looks pointedly at the Gentleman, who is growing<br>
    increasingly uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    It takes a trained eye to notice<br>
    certain... discrepancies.</p>
  <p> Data picks up a BOX OF MATCHES from the fireplace<br>
    mantel.</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    For example, whether someone is...</p>
  <p> He turns and tosses the box to the Gentleman's left<br>
    side.</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    Right or left handed!</p>
  <p> The Gentleman catches the box and Data lays in to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA/HOLMES<br>
    Your brother was right handed!<br>
    The alleged suicide note was<br>
    written by a left handed<br>
    individual such as yourself!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh... Data? It's in his right<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> Data stops in his tracks when he realizes. Geordi<br>
    suppresses a smile.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (as Data)<br>
    Curious... There seems to be a<br>
    problem in the Holodeck's spatial<br>
    orientation systems.</p>
  <p> GENTLEMAN<br>
    (scoffing)<br>
    London's greatest detective...</p>
  <p> He tosses the box back to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Freeze program.</p>
  <p> The Gentleman FREEZES in mid-motion. Geordi fishes out<br>
    his COMBADGE and activates it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    La Forge to Barclay...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Barclay here.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Reg, something went wrong with the<br>
    Holodeck program again.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY'S COM VOICE<br>
    I -- I'm sorry... I'll look into<br>
    it right away.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks. Come on, Data, we better<br>
    get back to Engineering.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/29/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR/HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as they ENTER from the library and move to the Holodeck<br>
    control panel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Computer, end program and save.</p>
  <p> He and Data set off down the corridor; BARCLAY comes<br>
    running around a corner and almost collides with them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Whoa, Reg --</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Oh, sorry, Commander... I'm on my<br>
    way to the... Holodeck...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sherlock Holmes program Three-A<br>
    has demonstrated some very curious<br>
    anomalies.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    There must be a glitch in the<br>
    matrix diodes. But I'll track it<br>
    down, don't worry.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, Reg. See you later.</p>
  <p> They move on and Barclay goes to the Holodeck doors;<br>
    they OPEN and he enters.</p>
  <p>3 INT. HOLODECK (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Barclay works the control panel adjacent to the Arch<br>
    Monitor.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Computer... run a diagnostic on<br>
    all Sherlock Holmes files and<br>
    display any anomalous programming<br>
    sequences.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Diagnostic complete .. all files<br>
    conform to specified parameters<br>
    except those contained in<br>
    protected memory.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Protected memory... ? Display<br>
    those sequences.</p>
  <p> A series of numbers and letters begin to scroll out on<br>
    the Monitor's screen. Barclay eyes them with a growing<br>
    curiosity.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (works)<br>
    Computer... unlock this sequence<br>
    and run the program.</p>
  <p> A human figure MATERIALIZES. It is PROFESSOR MORIARTY,<br>
    dressed in Victorian garb. He smiles as he takes in<br>
    his surroundings, touches his hands together to feel<br>
    their solidity.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Who are you... ?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (with a slight bow)<br>
    Professor James Moriarty.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (recognizes the name)<br>
    Ah... Moriarty... Sherlock Holmes'<br>
    arch enemy.</p>
  <p> Barclay, thinking this man is just an ordinary Holodeck<br>
    character, turns back to the Arch to peruse the monitor<br>
    and work the controls. Moriarty smiles uncertainly;<br>
    this isn't the reception he was expecting.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Are you right or left handed?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (perplexed)<br>
    Right handed... Would you very<br>
    much mind telling me --</p>
  <p> He's stopped in mid-sentence by the necessity of<br>
    catching the TOOL that Barclay tosses his way (with his<br>
    right hand).</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No problem there.</p>
  <p> Moriarty loses his patience with this odd young man.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/27/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Where is Captain Picard?</p>
  <p> Barclay stops in his tracks when he hears this -- a<br>
    Holodeck character referring to the real world is<br>
    unheard of.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Is he still Captain of this<br>
    vessel?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    How -- how do you know the<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    You don't know anything about what<br>
    happened, do you?<br>
    (growing angry)<br>
    I've been stored in memory for God<br>
    knows how long and no one's given<br>
    me a second thought.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (in disbelief)<br>
    You know... you know what you<br>
    are...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    A Holodeck character? A fictional<br>
    man... Yes, yes -- I know all<br>
    about your marvelous inventions.</p>
  <p> Moriarty is disgusted by the way he thinks he's been<br>
    treated.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I was created as a... plaything;<br>
    so your Commander Data could<br>
    masquerade as Sherlock Holmes.<br>
    But they created me too well...<br>
    and I became more than just a<br>
    character in a story. I became<br>
    self-aware; I am alive.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    That's not possible.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - TEASER 6A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (dismissing this)<br>
    Yet here I am. Tell me...<br>
    (doubting it even as he<br>
    asks)<br>
    -- has a way been found for me to<br>
    leave the confines of this<br>
    Holodeck world?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Leave the Holodeck? No, of course<br>
    not. You can only exist in here.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Damn you, Picard...<br>
    (trying to control his<br>
    anger)<br>
    He promised me something would be<br>
    done. I should have realized that<br>
    he would have said anything to get<br>
    me to release my hostage.</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts to these new pieces of the story.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Hostage... ?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (ominously)<br>
    How long have I been... locked<br>
    away?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (checks controls)<br>
    Looks like about... four years.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    It seemed longer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/29/92 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    What are you talking about? You<br>
    couldn't have been aware of the<br>
    passage of time --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    But I was.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Brief, terrifying periods of<br>
    consciousness... disembodied,<br>
    without substance...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I don't see how that could be<br>
    possible... maybe there was a<br>
    fragmentation in the protected<br>
    memory circuits...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Call it what you will. All I know<br>
    is that despite Picard's<br>
    promise... he's done nothing.<br>
    Just left me to go quietly mad...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm sure he hasn't forgotten his<br>
    promise... the Captain wouldn't do<br>
    that --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I'd like to talk to him.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Well, I can ask --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Ask him to meet me in the sitting<br>
    room at Baker Street. That would<br>
    be far more appropriate.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'll have to store you in memory<br>
    again until I get an answer.</p>
  <p> Barclay activates a circuit and Moriarty FRITZES out<br>
    for a second with an unusual EFFECT... then REAPPEARS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - TEASER 7A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    That was most unpleasant.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm sorry... let me try again.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (pointing at him)<br>
    Remember -- Two-Twenty-One B Baker<br>
    Street.</p>
  <p> Barclay nods and tweaks the controls. This time<br>
    Moriarty DISAPPEARS without a glitch.</p>
  <p> Barclay is relieved to have dealt with the situation.<br>
    He closes the panel he's been working on and EXITS.</p>
  <p> After the door shuts behind him a beat passes and<br>
    Moriarty REAPPEARS of his own volition. Off his<br>
    sinister smile we...</p>

  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as it hangs in space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46424.1.<br>
    The Enterprise has arrived at the<br>
    Detrian system to observe a unique<br>
    celestial event -- the collision<br>
    of two planets.</p>
  <p>5 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Geordi are showing TWO N.D's an OKUDAGRAM on<br>
    the pool table monitor. It shows the orbital paths of<br>
    two planets around their sun, and the Enterprise's<br>
    position relative to them.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Since both planets are gas giants,<br>
    neither possesses a solid surface.<br>
    Their atmospheres, however, will<br>
    come into contact in approximately<br>
    seventeen hours and nine minutes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If their collision causes a self-sustaining<br>
    fusion reaction... this<br>
    is what we might see.</p>
  <p> On the diagram the two planets collide and explode to<br>
    form a large flaming orb.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The birth of a new star.</p>
  <p> There is a sense of anticipation and excitement among<br>
    the gathered crewpersons. In the background we see<br>
    Barclay ENTER and head toward the group.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 11/04/92 - ACT ONE 9-10. 
  </p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (indicating)<br>
    The Enterprise will hold position<br>
    until the gravitational<br>
    instability subsides and we can<br>
    move in for a closer look. I want<br>
    triple redundancy on the sensor<br>
    arrays. We'll probably never get<br>
    another chance to see something<br>
    like this and I don't want to miss<br>
    anything.</p>
  <p> The N.D's nod and move away. Geordi and Data turn<br>
    their attention to Barclay.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Commander -- you'll never believe<br>
    what happened while I was working<br>
    on your program in the Holodeck...<br>
    Professor Moriarty appeared -- out<br>
    of nowhere.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    And he wants to talk to the<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> as PICARD, Data and Barclay reach the door to the<br>
    Holodeck and approach the control panel. They exchange<br>
    a look and Picard nods an &quot;okay&quot; to Barclay.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Computer, begin Sherlock Holmes<br>
    program Three A. Place us in the<br>
    drawing room at Two Twenty-One B<br>
    Baker Street.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Program complete.</p>
  <p> The doors open and they enter.</p>

  <p>8 INT. DRAWING ROOM - TWILIGHT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard, Barclay and Data look around.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Computer, access protected memory<br>
    and run Moriarty program.</p>
  <p> Moriarty APPEARS nearby. He turns to Picard and<br>
    regards him for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor... it's good to see you<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    If you'd missed my company, I<br>
    should think you'd have summoned<br>
    me before now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I want to assure you that we've<br>
    not forgotten you. We spent some<br>
    time investigating how you became<br>
    self-aware. Frankly, it is still<br>
    a mystery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    It is also irrelevant. What<br>
    concerns me is finding a way to<br>
    leave the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We wrestled with that problem for<br>
    some time... unfortunately without<br>
    success. We turned our findings<br>
    over to Starfleet's most<br>
    experienced theoretical<br>
    scientists.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    And what did your finest minds<br>
    come up with?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They have not arrived at a<br>
    solution, either.</p>
  <p> Moriarty stares at him, cold-eyed.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I am concerned by the fact that<br>
    you claim to have experienced the<br>
    passage of time while you were<br>

    Enough of this. I no longer<br>
    believe anything you say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand your frustration --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Do you really? When this is over<br>
    you'll walk out of this room, to<br>
    the real world and your own<br>
    concerns... and leave me here,<br>
    trapped in a world I know to be<br>
    nothing but illusion.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I cannot bear that. I must leave.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's impossible. You cannot<br>
    exist outside this room.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Are you certain of that?</p>

    Computer, exit.</p>
  <p> The door APPEARS in the library wall and opens to<br>
    reveal the corridor outside. A CREWMAN casts a curious<br>
    glance inside as he passes. Picard takes a book off<br>
    the shelf.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Even though an object appears<br>
    solid here on the Holodeck...</p>
  <p> Picard tosses the book into the corridor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It has no substance in the outside<br>
    world.</p>
  <p> Moriarty watches as it disintegrates, but remains<br>
    unconvinced.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    An object has no life. I do.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, Professor. You are a computer<br>
    simulation.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I have consciousness. And<br>
    conscious beings have will... the<br>
    mind endows them with powers that<br>
    are not necessarily understood --<br>
    even by you.<br>
    (stops, faces them)<br>
    If my will is strong enough,<br>
    perhaps I can exist outside this<br>
    room. Perhaps I can walk into<br>
    your world right now...</p>

    There. It is possible.</p>

    the required manner.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I won't go back into your<br>
    computer. No matter what happens<br>
    to me, it will be better than<br>
    drifting in that endless void.</p>
  <p> Moriarty takes another step toward the door.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must believe me, Professor.<br>
    If you step outside that door, you<br>
    will cease to exist.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    If I am nothing more than a<br>
    computer simulation, then very<br>
    little will have been lost. But<br>

  <p> A long beat -- and then he steps quickly into the<br>
    corridor. The others start after him. But they stop<br>
    short as they realize... that nothing has happened.<br>
    Moriarty is still there, very much corporeal. He turns<br>
    back to face them with a bold, confident smile.</p>

    Then perhaps you don't know as<br>
    much as you thought.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (with distaste)<br>
    Policemen... I'd recognize them in<br>

  <p> BEVERLY is scanning Moriarty with a TRICORDER; he is<br>
    seated on the biobed. She seems surprised by the<br>
    readings she's getting, looks over to Picard, Data and<br>
    Geordi. The Security Men hang back by the door.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    From what I can tell... he's<br>
    real... he's human.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    What else would I be, my dear<br>
    woman?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His DNA is a little unusual... but<br>
    all the major systems are there<br>
    and functioning normally.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor... the Holodeck is capable<br>
    of creating anatomically correct<br>
    organisms, down to the cellular<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    Is there any difference between<br>
    the biological readings of those<br>
    simulations -- and Professor<br>
    Moriarty?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Yes. The quantum signatures are<br>
    quite different. They wouldn't<br>
    read that way on simulations.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (looking with his VISOR)<br>
    As far as I can see... there's no<br>
    evidence that the molecules in his<br>
    body are losing cohesion. They<br>
    seem to be as immutable as<br>
    ordinary matter.</p>
  <p> Picard regards the man sitting on the bio-bed.<br>
    Impossible, but here he is.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, Professor... my crew will<br>
    continue to investigate, but for<br>
    the moment you seem to have<br>
    accomplished a miracle.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The question is... now that you're<br>
    here... what do we do with you?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I ask only that I be allowed to<br>
    explore this new world. Your<br>
    vessel, for instance: what sea<br>
    does she sail? Might we go above<br>
    deck?</p>
  <p> Picard and the others exchange glances.</p>

    Security Men. We see a look of amazement cross<br>
    Moriarty's features as he catches his first glimpse of<br>
    the stars through the forward windows.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    My god... we're adrift in the<br>
    heavens...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not adrift, Professor. The<br>
    Enterprise is a Starship, capable<br>
    of travelling through space.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Extraordinary...</p>
  <p> He looks out at the stars in wonder.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Are we far from Earth? What is<br>
    the range of this ship? What<br>
    means of locomotion does it<br>
    use... ?</p>
  <p> He turns to stare at Picard.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    There's so much for me to learn...<br>
    (sits at a table)<br>
    I hardly know where to start.</p>
  <p> Picard sits with him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We can give you books that will<br>
    help...</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Good, good... I want to start<br>
    making plans... determine what I'm<br>
    going to do with my life...</p>
  <p> Picard's tendencies are not to rush through this so<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I hope you'll plan on staying<br>
    aboard for a while... we'd still<br>
    like to understand more about<br>
    what's happened to you.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I feel it necessary to warn you<br>
    that criminal behavior is no more<br>
    acceptable in the twenty-fourth<br>
    century than it was in the<br>
    nineteenth. And much harder to<br>
    get away with.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Don't worry, Captain... my past is<br>
    nothing but a fiction -- the<br>
    scribblings of an Englishman dead<br>
    now for four centuries. I hope<br>
    to... leave his books on the<br>

  <p> He breaks off, a troubled expression on his face.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    In considering all these vast<br>
    possibilities... I suddenly feel<br>
    very much alone. I am a man out<br>
    of time, Captain... and that<br>
    isolates me...</p>
  <p> Picard regards him carefully. It sounds as though<br>
    Moriarty is after something. He doesn't respond, and<br>
    after a brief moment --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    You've been more gracious than I<br>
    could ever have imagined... I<br>
    wonder... can I impose on your<br>
    generosity once again?</p>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    There is a woman... the Countess<br>
    Regina Barthalomew. She was<br>
    created as a Holodeck character<br>
    for one of Commander Data's<br>
    programs...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She was designed to be the love of<br>
    my life... Could she also be<br>
    brought off the Holodeck?</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback by this unexpected request.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor... you must believe me<br>
    when I tell you that we don't know<br>
    how or why you are able to exist<br>
    off the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I do believe you --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    According to the laws of physics,<br>
    it's impossible. We would have no<br>
    idea how to do it again.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    As I understand it, I was endowed<br>
    with consciousness four years ago<br>
    because someone said to the<br>
    computer, &quot;Create an opponent with<br>
    the capacity to out think Data&quot; --<br>
    or words to that effect. Could we<br>
    not make a request in similar<br>
    language on behalf of the<br>
    Countess?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Even if we had reason to believe<br>
    that would be successful... I'm<br>
    not sure I could sanction it.<br>
    Please understand, Professor...<br>
    you are in essence a new life form --<br>
    one which we didn't intend to<br>
    create and don't fully understand.<br>
    The moral and ethical implications<br>
    of deliberately creating another<br>
    like you... are overwhelming.</p>
  <p> Moriarty flares at this; the argument mounts in<br>
    intensity.</p>

  <p>11 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Is it morally and ethically<br>
    acceptable to deny me the woman I<br>
    love -- so that you can put your<br>
    conscience at ease? Are you<br>
    saying that you will simply<br>
    dictate how I am to live my life?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assure you we will make every<br>
    effort to make you as comfortable<br>
    as we can --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    So long as I accept the terms<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Captain... I am a powerless man.<br>
    You hold my future, my<br>
    happiness... my very life in your<br>

    we have some responsibility to<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's very romantic, but until we<br>
    know just what it was that walked<br>
    off that Holodeck, I don't think<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Yes. You know all about that. I<br>
    stayed in the dungeon of your<br>
    computer for years waiting for you<br>
    to learn more... it wasn't until<br>
    I took things into my own hands<br>

    Forgive me, Professor, but I<br>

  <p> This seems to hit Moriarty where he's vulnerable; there<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Your computer designed her to be<br>
    a person of impeccable integrity.<br>
    She would never commit a crime.</p>
  <p> The tone of his voice gives Picard an opening.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You must love her very much...</p>
  <p> Clearly, he does. Whenever he speaks of her,<br>
    Moriarty's hostility recedes, and he speaks with simple<br>
    sincerity.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    The program fashioned her for me<br>
    to love. But I must admit that I<br>
    would have done so anyway. She is<br>
    remarkable. My life has not been<br>
    the same since I met her. I don't<br>
    simply love her, Captain. I adore<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    would be important to you.</p>
  <p> This seems to have an impact on Moriarty. Picard<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Give us a little time to determine<br>

    Those two planets will collide in<br>
    less than five hours and explode<br>
    to form a new star. If we don't<br>

    be able to maintain a safe<br>

  <p> Moriarty shrugs.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Not alone. Not without the<br>
    Countess.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (firm)<br>
    We're studying ways to bring her<br>
    off the Holodeck safely. But five<br>
    hours is not enough time.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I'm not so sure. A deadline has<br>
    a wonderful way of concentrating<br>
    the mind.</p>

    Mister Data... investigate the<br>

    Professor Moriarty has asked.</p>
  <p> Picard fixes Moriarty with a look.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In the meantime, there are a few<br>
    things we have to discuss.</p>
  <p> Picard moves toward the Ready Room without waiting for<br>

  <p> Geordi, Barclay and Data stand around the pool table<br>
    trying to come up with a miracle.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (frustrated)<br>
    I can't think of anything else.<br>
    We've taken the Holodeck apart<br>
    circuit by circuit. There's<br>
    nothing there that could account<br>
    for Moriarty's ability to exist<br>
    outside the grid.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So how are we supposed to do the<br>
    same thing for the Countess?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe we are being asked to<br>
    develop an entirely new science.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... in less than five hours.<br>
    Piece of cake.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we should consider the<br>
    Transporter system. It uses many<br>
    of the same principles as the<br>
    Holodeck.<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Except the Transporter<br>
    reconstitutes energy into<br>
    permanent form; Holodeck matter<br>
    doesn't have any cohesion unless<br>
    it's inside the grid.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I wonder what would happen if we<br>
    tried to beam a Holodeck object<br>
    off the grid?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing would happen. A Holodeck<br>
    object is just a simulation --<br>
    there's nothing there to provide<br>
    a pattern lock for the<br>
    Transporter.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, if it were possible to<br>
    lock onto the object... it might<br>
    rematerialize with the molecular<br>
    cohesion of conventional matter.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's a big &quot;if&quot;... the<br>
    Transporter just isn't going to<br>
    recognize simulated matter.</p>

    (idea beginning)<br>
    ... unless we could find a way to<br>
    compensate for the phase variance.<br>

  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Well... it has to do with...<br>

    It's nothing you have to worry<br>

  <p> COUNTESS<br>

    Are you suggesting that it's<br>
    beyond my comprehension?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>

    Oh, no... not at all. It's very<br>
    simple, really. I need to enhance<br>

    get a better lock on the signal.</p>

    Did you try taking her off the<br>
    Holodeck?</p>
  <p> Moriarty hesitates.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    No. I am unwilling to risk the<br>
    Countess' safety. I want to make<br>
    sure nothing will happen to her.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    We may be closer to freedom than<br>
    you think, James.<br>

    These are devices which will<br>

    I just gave my command codes to<br>
    the computer... thinking I was<br>
    regaining control of the ship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You may have inadvertently given<br>
    Professor Moriarty the means of<br>
    gaining control of the real<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Since he has never actually left<br>
    the Holodeck... he'll probably<br>
    demand that Commander Riker find<br>
    a way for him to do so.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    As long as Moriarty has control of<br>
    the ship -- we are vulnerable.<br>

    Somehow, we have to find a way to<br>
    give him what he wants.</p>

  <p>32 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Geordi and various N.D's. Moriarty is on<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where is Captain Picard? What<br>
    have you done with Lieutenant<br>
    Barclay and Commander Data?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    They're safe... for now.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Release control of this ship.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I'm afraid I can't do that.</p>
  <p> Moriarty holds all the cards and he's enjoying playing<br>
    them. Riker doesn't like any of this one bit.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you want?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I only want what you have the<br>
    luxury of taking for granted:<br>
    freedom. I want to leave this<br>
    Holodeck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think you know that's<br>
    impossible.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Your crewmates here in my<br>
    little... ship in a bottle, seem<br>
    a bit more optimistic.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    They attempted to use your<br>
    Transporter device to remove a<br>
    simulated object from the<br>
    Holodeck.</p>
  <p> Riker turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If they tried it, they must have<br>
    thought they were on to something.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Their attempt was futile because<br>
    their Transporter was just a<br>
    facsimile. I expect more from<br>
    you.</p>

  <p>32 CONTINUED: (2)</p>

    Just because our Transporter is<br>
    real doesn't mean it's going to<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    I sense a distressing lack of<br>
    enthusiasm on your parts...</p>
  <p> Moriarty reaches forward and presses a button on the<br>
    PADD in front of him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    Hello... have we met?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p> She extends her hand to him, graciously.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    James has told me all about you.<br>
    I am Regina, Countess Barthalomew.<br>
    May I offer you tea, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, thank you.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've come to prevail upon your<br>
    intelligence and insight.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    (a slight smile)<br>
    But not, apparently, my humility.</p>
  <p> Picard adopts a more formal, 19th century manner of<br>
    speech, which the Countess might find more familiar.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Credit where it is due, Madame.<br>
    You are clearly a woman not only<br>
    of breeding, but of wit and<br>
    sagacity.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    And you, sir, are a man of<br>
    charm... and guile.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You remind me of the Viscount<br>
    Bisimuth... he could bewitch any<br>
    woman who breathed...</p>
  <p> Picard regards her with a smile, enjoying the banter<br>
    with this beautiful woman.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And do you suspect that is my<br>
    intent?</p>
  <p> She leans toward him and gazes at him with sparkling<br>
    eyes.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/29/92 - ACT FOUR 42A.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    I cannot be certain of your<br>
    intent... but I am certain that<br>
    you are the kind of man who<br>
    usually gets exactly what he<br>
    wants.</p>
  <p> She is intriguinging and challenging. Picard cannot<br>
    help but be charmed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What does a woman like you see in<br>
    a man like Professor Moriarty?</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    He is an exciting man, Captain.<br>
    Brilliant... incisive... ruthless.<br>
    He has an almost irresistible<br>
    appeal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He is also an arch criminal.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    Only because he was written that<br>
    way.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I see him much differently,<br>
    Captain -- he is not a villain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it is your desire to leave<br>
    the Holodeck in order to be with<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    More than anything. Can you help<br>
    us?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/30/92 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can. We've learned that if we<br>
    uncouple the Transporter's<br>
    Heisenberg Compensators and allow<br>
    them to rescramble randomly, we<br>
    can beam a Holodeck object... or<br>
    a person... off the grid -- with<br>
    all the cohesion of conventional<br>
    matter.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    That's splendid! I must tell<br>
    James.</p>
  <p> Picard puts out a hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Wait... I came to you with this<br>
    information because I believe you<br>
    are someone who will listen to a<br>
    reasonable proposition. Whose<br>
    mind is open to compromise.</p>
  <p> She eyes him carefully.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My ship is in danger... it is<br>
    imperative that I regain<br>
    navigational control. You must<br>
    convince Moriarty to return voice<br>
    commands to me... or we will not<br>
    modify the Transporter.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Once I have voice command, I<br>
    promise we will transport you from<br>
    the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    Forgive me, Captain... but that<br>
    sounds a bit more like a threat<br>
    than a compromise.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

    a thousand people.</p>
  <p> She looks at him for a moment, then --</p>

    I'll do what I can.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any progress?</p>

    I've got my people modifying the<br>
    Transporter... but I don't see how<br>
    running Holodeck matter through<br>
    the pattern buffer will give it<br>
    molecular cohesion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any luck getting back systems<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Moriarty has reinitialized the<br>

    There are force fields blocking<br>

    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>38 INT. DRAWING ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Countess has told Moriarty about her conversation<br>
    with Picard.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Think, my dear. You're certain he<br>
    said they had to uncouple the<br>
    Heisenburg Compensators?</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    Yes, James, I'm quite sure. But<br>
    he won't do it unless you return<br>
    control of the ship to him.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    I have them running around like<br>
    rats in a maze.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    It's an entirely reasonable<br>
    request. There are lives at stake --</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Yes, ours.</p>
  <p> COUNTESS<br>
    What harm would there be in<br>
    accepting his proposition?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    My dear, you are as brilliant as<br>
    you are beautiful. Nonetheless,<br>
    there are things you do not<br>
    understand. You must let me<br>
    handle this.<br>
    (beat)<br>

    into a gravity well. It'll be<br>
    destroyed within twenty-five<br>
    minutes... Holodeck and all.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Then I'm sure you'll be motivated<br>
    to listen to me... very, very<br>

    James? Where will we go when we<br>
    leave here?</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Everywhere, my darling. There are<br>

  <p> The angrier Riker becomes, the calmer Moriarty seems to<br>
    get.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    And I intend to honor it. I have<br>

    destroyed. Just give me one of<br>
    your...<br>
    (a new word)<br>
    -- shuttlecraft, and allow us to<br>
    leave in peace.</p>

    There's no time for this. Release<br>
    the command codes and we'll talk.</p>
  <p> MORIARTY<br>

    I will not release your vessel...<br>
    until I'm looking at it through a<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    You do have a destination? The<br>

  <p> MORIARTY<br>
    Your concern for our welfare is<br>
    touching.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I suggest you head for Meles Two.<br>
    It's the nearest inhabited planet,<br>
    and the people are friendly.<br>
    Where you go from there is your<br>
    business.</p>

  <p> He looks at her with great tenderness.</p>
  <p>44 INT. SHUTTLEBAY</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf stand at the console as we last saw<br>
    them.</p>

    Computer...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker and Worf turn at the sound of the Captain's<br>
    voice.</p>
  <p>45 INCLUDE PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as he walks toward them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Store program Picard delta one in<br>
    active memory and discontinue<br>
    simulation.</p>
  <p> The shuttlebay DISAPPEARS, including Riker and Worf.<br>
    Picard is now standing in the empty grid.</p>
  <p>46 INT. HOLODECK GRID</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Program stored.</p>
  <p> Picard crosses toward the door and EXITS.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Barclay are waiting for Picard as he ENTERS<br>
    from the grid. They look at him expectantly for a<br>
    moment and he breaks into a smile.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It worked... they believed they<br>
    were off the Holodeck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Did Moriarty release the voice<br>
    commands, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll soon find out. Computer...<br>
    discontinue the Holodeck<br>
    simulation created by Professor<br>
    Moriarty.</p>
  <p> The Corridor DISAPPEARS and the three men find<br>
    themselves standing in the empty grid.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - 10/26/92 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>48 INT. HOLODECK GRID</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So far, so good. This should be<br>
    the Holodeck on the real<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (activates combadge)<br>
    Picard to Bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/29/92 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>49 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker, Geordi and various N.D's.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain! Are you all right?</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Yes, Number One. What is your<br>
    status?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We regained full control of the<br>
    ship a few minutes ago.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    And the planetary collision?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Six minutes away... we're pulling<br>
    back to a safe distance.</p>
  <p>50 INT. HOLODECK GRID</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We'll join you shortly.</p>
  <p> Worf and his team (that we saw earlier trying to<br>
    disable the force field) appear in the doorway to the<br>
    Corridor.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're all right, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> Barclay crosses to the Arch and opens a panel. He<br>
    removes a cube-shaped piece of hardware.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>51 OMITTED</p>
  <p>52 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Data, Barclay, Riker, Beverly and Troi. The<br>
    TECH cube is sitting on the table between them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How did you do it, sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/29/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We were able to program the<br>
    Holodeck inside the Holodeck, and<br>
    use the same ruse on Moriarty that<br>
    he used on us.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    When he attempted to contact the<br>
    real Bridge, he was in fact<br>
    talking to a simulation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/28/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You mean he never realized that he<br>
    hadn't left the Holodeck?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (gesturing to the cube)<br>
    The simulation is continuing even<br>
    now, inside that cube.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A miniature Holodeck?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In a way, Doctor. However, it has<br>
    no physicality. The program is<br>
    continuing... but only within the<br>
    computer circuitry.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    As far as Moriarty and the<br>
    Countess know, they're half way to<br>
    Meles Two by now.</p>
  <p> Barclay picks of the TECH cube and inserts it in a slot<br>
    inside a larger, briefcase sized piece of hardware with<br>
    BLINKIES on it.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    This enhancement module contains<br>
    enough active memory to provide<br>
    them with a lifetime of<br>
    experiences.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They'll live out their lives...<br>
    and never know the difference.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    So in a sense... you did give<br>
    Moriarty what he wanted.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles because he feels he has at last been able<br>
    to fulfill his obligation to Moriarty.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Ship in a Bottle&quot; - REV. 10/28/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In a sense. And... who knows --<br>
    our reality might not be all that<br>
    different from theirs. All<br>
    this...<br>
    (gestures around him)<br>
    ... might be nothing more than an<br>
    elaborate simulation being run<br>
    inside a little device... sitting<br>
    on someone else's table...</p>
  <p> Picard's just making a philosophical point that brings<br>
    smiles around the room. Except for Barclay, who seems<br>
    a little disquieted by what he said.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well... I believe we have a new<br>
    born star to study.<br>
    (standing; indicating<br>
    the cube)<br>
    Mister Barclay... you'll see that<br>
    is kept in a safe place?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> Barclay adjusts a control or two on the unit as<br>
    everyone files out of the room. He stands and picks up<br>
    the unit to follow, but then decides to wait and allow<br>
    the door to close behind them. Once alone, he looks<br>
    around the room.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (tentatively)<br>
    Computer... end program.</p>
  <p> When nothing happens, Barclay is satisfied he's not<br>
    still inside some Holodeck simulation somewhere. He<br>
    suddenly feels foolish for having doubted it, smiles<br>
    sheepishly, and leaves the room.</p>
  <p>53 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As it hangs in space near the flickering new star.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
