  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moving at impulse against softly glowing bands<br>
    of gaseous material.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 46731.5.<br>
    We are in the midst of the<br>
    Volterra nebula, a stellar<br>
    &quot;nursery.&quot; Our three week mission<br>
    is a routine analysis of several<br>
    dozen protostars in various stages<br>
    of development.</p>
  <p>2 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, TROI, WORF are at their stations; DATA is at<br>
    the aft science station, working his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, I have completed the<br>
    spectral evaluation of the outer<br>
    shell.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Our survey of this protostar is<br>
    complete.</p>
  <p> Picard acknowledges with a nod.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Con)<br>
    Ensign, lay in a course to the<br>
    next one, three quarters impulse.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The Ensign works her controls.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Yes, Number One?</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    May I see you in the Observation<br>
    Lounge, Sir?</p>
  <p> Picard is puzzled but not alarmed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Of course. I'll be right there.</p>
  <p> Picard stands and heads for the Observation Lounge<br>
    door.</p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS from the Bridge -- his attention is<br>
    immediately riveted toward an OBJECT on the middle of<br>
    the table. It is a TERRA-COTTA FIGURINE, roundish,<br>
    about a foot wide and tall, of vaguely HUMANOID shape,<br>
    with a serene look on its face -- like some alien<br>
    Buddha. Its surface is worn, it looks ancient.</p>
  <p> Picard is stunned to see it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    My God...</p>
  <p>5 INCLUDE RIKER AND PROFESSOR RICHARD GALEN</p>
  <p> PROFESSOR GALEN is in his sixties, tall, slender, greyhaired,<br>
    and seems to emanate dignity and intelligence.<br>
    Riker has a smile on his face.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Then you can identify this object,<br>
    Mister Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback by the man's face and voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor Galen.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    (lightly)<br>
    I suppose I should say -- Captain<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard glances toward Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (explains)<br>
    Professor Galen hailed me from his<br>
    shuttle an hour ago. He suggested<br>
    that we surprise you.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    To clarify... I insisted and your<br>
    First Officer was kind enough to<br>
    accommodate me. I hope I haven't<br>
    been overly presumptuous...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My star pupil now being master of<br>
    the stars...</p>
  <p> Picard brushes it off with a wave of his hand.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No one is more welcome on my ship.</p>
  <p> He turns again to the figurine on the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I never thought I would see a<br>
    Kurlan naiskos.<br>
    (to Galen)<br>
    Fifth Dynasty?</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Is that your conclusion, Mister<br>
    Picard.<br>
    (catching himself)<br>
    Forgive me again, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please. &quot;Mister&quot; will do just<br>
    fine.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts to this with a smile, as Picard examines<br>
    the figurine more closely, suddenly the student<br>
    attempting to shine before his mentor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The overall configuration is<br>
    certainly Fifth Dynasty. But the<br>
    surface ornamentation...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> Picard steps closer, leans toward the object, sees an<br>
    extremely faded HINT OF COLOR.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Green polychrome over the eyes...<br>
    And the eyes themselves... open.<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Third Dynasty. From the workshop<br>
    of the Master of Tarquin Hill.</p>
  <p> The Professor nods, pleased.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Well done.</p>
  <p> Picard explains to Riker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Master of Tarquin Hill created<br>
    ceramic designs that were three<br>
    centuries ahead of his time. We<br>
    only know him by his work -- his<br>
    name has never been discovered...</p>
  <p> Picard indicates the figurine.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This object is over twelve<br>
    thousand years old...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The planet Kurl? That's a hell of<br>
    a long way outside Federation<br>
    territory.</p>
  <p> As if that was Picard's next question, the Captain<br>
    turns to his former instructor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Indeed. I thought you had<br>
    completed your studies of Kurlan<br>
    artifacts some time ago.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    I happened to be in the<br>
    neighborhood last summer. I<br>
    couldn't resist.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't seem to consider this an answer to his<br>
    question, but the Professor immediately refocuses his<br>
    attention onto the figurine.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's complete?</p>
  <p> Galen answers with a smile. Picard steps over to the<br>
    figurine, grasps its sides with both hands and LIFTS --<br>
    the top half separates from the bottom, revealing a<br>
    hollow interior. Inside are over a dozen TINY<br>
    FIGURINES, similar in shape to the original.</p>
  <p> Riker steps over to look inside as Picard explains with<br>
    excitement.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Kurl believed every individual<br>
    is a community of individuals.<br>
    Inside us are many voices, each<br>
    with its own desires, its own<br>
    style, its own way of viewing the<br>
    world.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up one of the tiny figurines.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But Kurlan civilization died out<br>
    thousands of years ago. It's rare<br>
    to find a figurine intact.<br>
    (to the Professor)<br>
    A truly incredible find.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    It's yours, Jean-Luc.</p>
  <p> Picard shakes his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How could I accept this --</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    ... Graciously, Mister Picard. You<br>
    could accept it graciously.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Picard nods, touched.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How long can you stay? There's so<br>
    much to talk about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Professor is scheduled to meet<br>
    a Vulcan transport the day after<br>
    tomorrow.</p>
  <p> Picard's face falls.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Two days? That's not nearly<br>
    enough time...</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    We may have considerably more than<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't understand.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    I am currently on an expedition.<br>
    A journey into unexplored<br>
    historical territory.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And I intend to take you with me.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a surprised look. OFF their<br>
    expressions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> The Enterprise at impulse speed in the protostar<br>
    nebula.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental. It<br>
    has been over thirty years since<br>
    I last saw my archaeology<br>
    professor. His presence has taken<br>
    me back to a time when I had<br>
    considered a very different<br>
    career...</p>
  <p>7 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Picard is at a table having tea with Professor Galen.<br>
    The Captain doesn't frequent Ten Forward, and draws a<br>
    few curious glances from the other patrons.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    I read your paper on the Kea Four<br>
    excavation that you delivered at<br>
    last year's symposium. It was...<br>
    informative.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Damning with faint praise.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    One can hardly serve two masters.<br>
    For a Starfleet Captain at the<br>
    helm of the Federation flagship...<br>
    attendance alone would have been<br>
    impressive enough. But you still<br>
    managed to present a piece of<br>
    original research.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A small piece, granted.<br>
    Nevertheless, I admire your<br>
    tenacity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had hoped to see you there. You<br>
    said in your last letter that you<br>
    might go.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Much too busy, I'm afraid. I was<br>
    on the far side of the Aolian<br>
    Cluster at the time.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts with surprise. Then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor Galen, may I ask a frank<br>
    question?</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Please.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your published writings have<br>
    been... sporadic over the last<br>
    ten years or so. Your appearances<br>
    at symposia have been rare -- or<br>
    scheduled and then cancelled at<br>
    the last minute. The finest<br>
    archaeologist of the century has<br>
    become shrouded with an air of<br>
    mystery.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    And my reputation as a result has<br>
    no doubt grown.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I've yet to run across anyone that<br>
    didn't love a good mystery.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    The Sataaran of Sothis Three<br>
    disdain them.<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Nevertheless, as a general<br>
    principle, your statement holds.</p>
  <p> A beat. Picard leans forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor, what have you been<br>
    doing for the last decade?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Are you familiar with<br>
    micropaleontology?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Studying fossil records at a<br>
    microscopic level. I remember<br>
    reading your papers on the<br>
    subject. But that was years<br>
    ago... Then your work seemed to<br>
    stop.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    No. The work continued.</p>
  <p> The man lowers his voice.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I made a discovery so profound in<br>
    its implications that silence<br>
    seemed the wisest course.</p>
  <p> He pauses a moment.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This... work has occupied my every<br>
    waking thought, it's intruded upon<br>
    my dreams. It's become my life.<br>
    And when it's finished, when I<br>
    announce my findings...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It will be heard half-way across<br>
    the galaxy.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell me --</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    ... I'm sorry, Mister Picard. But<br>
    that information has a price --<br>
    your agreement to join me on the<br>
    final leg of this expedition.</p>
  <p> A silent beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For how long?</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Three months. Perhaps a year. If<br>
    we had a starship and complete<br>
    diplomatic access -- a matter of<br>
    weeks. But we'll have only my<br>
    shuttle, the transports we can<br>
    arrange, and our combined talents.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why can't you do this without me?</p>
  <p> The Professor looks at him for a moment, then glances<br>
    away.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    I'm not a young man. There will<br>
    be hazards along the way. I don't<br>
    want my own inadequacies to<br>
    jeopardize the completion of this<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Professor, I'm honored that you'd<br>
    think of me. But I have a<br>
    responsibility --</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    ... to History. What if you could<br>
    have helped Schliemann discover<br>
    the City of Troy? Or if you had<br>
    been with M'Tell as she stepped<br>
    upon Ya'Seem for the first time?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How could anything compare?</p>
  <p> A long, silent beat. Picard stands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I sleep on it?</p>
  <p> The Professor nods.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    Dream not of today, Mister Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - 02/04/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Picard smiles, remembering.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Dream not of today.&quot; The night<br>
    blessing of the Yash-El.</p>
  <p> GALEN<br>
    As I recall, you missed that<br>
    question on the final exam.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've had a few years to look it<br>
    up.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Enterprise is yours, for as<br>
    long as you're here.</p>
  <p> Galen acknowledges the gesture with a nod of thanks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Dream not of today, Professor.</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the door. OFF Galen's contemplative<br>
    face...</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse in the protostar nebula.</p>
  <p>9 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard is at a table, staring into space. The ancient<br>
    FIGURINE is in front of him, open, the tiny figures<br>
    visible inside. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens and BEVERLY steps inside, her cheeriness<br>
    in sharp contrast to Picard's contemplative mood.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Good morning.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You look like you've been up for<br>
    awhile.</p>
  <p> She goes to the replicator.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Beverly reacts, then turns to the replicator.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to replicator)<br>
    One tea, Earl Grey, hot. One<br>
    macchiato.</p>
  <p> The SOUND of the replicator. She turns away from it<br>
    with a mug of tea and a tiny cappuccino in an espresso<br>
    cup. She takes them over to Picard, then sits next to<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Let's hear it...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had a long talk with Professor<br>
    Galen last night. He asked me to<br>
    leave the Enterprise -- to join<br>
    him on an archaeological<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc... that must be tempting.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wouldn't leave the Enterprise.<br>
    But the offer itself has made me<br>
    feel a certain... regret.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That you could have been an<br>
    archaeologist instead of a<br>
    starship Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not exactly. I'm certainly not<br>
    sorry about the path I've taken...</p>

  <p> Picard sips his tea, sets it down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But... there's a certain...<br>
    passion that comes with the<br>
    singleminded pursuit of the past.</p>
  <p> He picks up one of the tiny figurines.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    To be captured by an image created<br>
    by another's hand, hundreds or<br>
    thousands of years ago. A being<br>
    long dead, who still speaks to you<br>
    through that image, who says &quot;I<br>
    was alive, as you are alive.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard sets the figurine on the table in front of them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've only approximated that<br>
    feeling. Professor Galen made it<br>
    his life.</p>
  <p> He places the tiny figurine into the larger one with<br>
    the others.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Professor didn't choose this<br>
    figure at random -- the many<br>
    voices inside the one. He knows<br>
    that the past is one of the most<br>
    insistent voices inside me. This<br>
    gift was meant to remind me of<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And the exploration of space?<br>
    Surely that counts for<br>
    something...</p>

    I'm just sorry I have to say no to<br>
    him a second time.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You two were very close, weren't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I had a father. But Professor<br>
    Galen was like a father who<br>
    understood me. And he had<br>
    children -- but none followed in<br>
    his footsteps. So, I was like the<br>
    son who understood him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I guess it was difficult for both<br>
    of you when you left.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Professor is somewhat...<br>
    internal. He doesn't express<br>
    feelings easily. But it was<br>
    difficult for me.</p>
  <p> Picard picks up the top half of the larger figurine and<br>
    replaces it onto the lower.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    In some ways, I wish he'd never<br>
    come on board.</p>

    him. You chose not to abandon a<br>
    life-long career. It was the<br>
    right decision. And it was in no<br>
    way responsible for his death.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, I realize that.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    I know how much the Professor<br>
    meant to you... and how much you<br>
    want to find out what happened...<br>
    but staring at these numbers isn't<br>
    going to bring him back.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, this isn't a case of my<br>
    taking the Enterprise and its crew<br>
    on some wild goose chase in order<br>
    to purge myself of guilt or<br>
    remorse.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I simply will not allow Galen's<br>
    death to be in vain. If that<br>
    means inconveniencing a group of<br>
    squabbling delegates for a few<br>
    more days, then so be it. The<br>
    responsibility is mine.</p>
  <p> It's a dismissal. Troi nods.</p>

    How can that be possible? They're<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    An algorithm? Are you saying<br>
    these DNA fragments are elements<br>

    So four billion years ago, someone<br>

    across the galaxy.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The genetic information must have<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We couldn't know that until we<br>
    assembled the entire program and<br>
    ran it.</p>
  <p> Geordi points to several places on the graphic of the<br>
    &quot;program&quot; that appear to be missing pieces.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There are several fragments still<br>
    missing. We've tried all the DNA<br>
    material in Federation records,<br>
    but we can't find any with<br>
    compatible protein configurations.</p>

    It may be a long shot, but we<br>

    them have the correct protein<br>
    configurations.</p>

  <p> Beverly EXITS. Geordi has been thinking for a few<br>
    minutes.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know Captain... I've been<br>

    about this program.</p>
  <p> Picard give him a questioning look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    was on Indri Eight... and that's<br>

    various guises of innocent bewilderment.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    We are merely scouting the planet<br>
    for possible colonization --</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Pah! A ridiculous story.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    And why are you here, then?</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Scientific research.</p>
  <p> The Cardassian laughs and the Klingon fumes. Picard<br>
    steps in.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's no point in trying to<br>
    deceive each other... we all know<br>
    about Professor Galen's research<br>
    and about the computer program<br>
    which is composed of DNA<br>
    fragments.</p>
  <p> The Klingon and Cardassian exchange looks, but say<br>
    nothing -- trying to hang onto any advantage. Picard<br>
    pushes on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll take your silence as<br>
    confirmation. Now, it stands to<br>
    reason that no one has all the DNA<br>
    fragments necessary to complete<br>
    the program.<br>
    (to Cardassian)<br>
    You were the first to arrive in<br>
    this system. Do you have an<br>
    organic sample from the planet<br>
    below?</p>
  <p> Gul Ocett considers him for a moment, glances at the<br>
    Klingon and calculates her response for a beat. Then<br>
    she decides to move forward.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    Yes. And I will open fire on<br>
    anyone who attempts to obtain<br>
    another one.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (with contempt)<br>
    As if we fear Cardassian<br>
    threats...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (ignoring him)<br>
    I believe one of you also has a<br>
    fragment from Indri Eight.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    Yes. And there will be no other<br>
    samples from Indri Eight.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    What is that supposed to mean?</p>

    Typical Klingon thinking... take<br>
    what you want and then destroy the<br>
    rest.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All of us are missing some of the<br>
    fragments... but not necessarily<br>
    the same ones. Unless we combine<br>
    what we have, we'll never learn<br>
    the secret of this program.</p>
  <p> The Klingon brushes this all off with an impatient wave<br>
    of his arm.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    There is no secret. It is an<br>
    ancient weapon design of<br>
    incredible power. And the Klingon<br>
    Empire will not allow it to fall<br>
    into an enemy's hands.<br>
    (to Picard)<br>

    A weapon? The Yridian who sold us<br>
    the information claimed that the<br>
    program would yield the key to an<br>
    unlimited power source.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until we assemble the entire<br>
    program no on can know its<br>
    ultimate purpose.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    He's right. For all we know it<br>
    might be a recipe for biscuits.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Biscuits? If that is what you<br>
    believe, then go back to<br>
    Cardassia. I will send you my<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enough. Without cooperation we<br>
    will get nowhere.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    What do you propose?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you both bring the fragments<br>
    you possess to the Enterprise, I<br>
    will combine them with ours. The<br>
    result will be observed by all<br>
    parties simultaneously, giving no<br>
    one the advantage.</p>

  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> The anticipation in the room goes up a few notches.<br>
    The Klingon steps away with his machine, and the<br>
    Cardassian takes his place, plugging her computer into<br>
    the console interface. Data again works the controls.</p>
  <p> A beat -- then several of the remaining &quot;holes&quot; are<br>
    filled in. Now, only one &quot;hole&quot; is left unfilled.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's still one missing piece...</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Pahk! We have surrendered what we<br>
    had for nothing.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    You are remarkably short-sighted,<br>
    Nu'Daq. We are closer to the<br>
    answer than we were.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And I think we're very close,<br>
    indeed.</p>
  <p> The others stare at him, puzzled.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    How can that be? We have no idea<br>
    where to start looking for the<br>
    missing DNA fragment.</p>
  <p> Picard begins to move about the room, trying to reason<br>
    this all out.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    This is a... jigsaw puzzle...<br>
    whose pieces have been scattered<br>
    across the galaxy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Doesn't it seem reasonable to<br>

    the pieces in our DNA?<br>

    for changes in star configurations<br>
    over four billion years... and<br>
    extrapolate for the missing piece.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That'll take me a while to set<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The computer is processing the<br>

    as there is any information.</p>
  <p> The Klingon smiles, and, without being invited, sits<br>
    opposite Data.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Commander, your reputation for...<br>
    physical strength is known even in<br>

    I am familiar with many Klingon<br>
    rituals -- including the B'aht<br>
    Qul.</p>
  <p> The Klingon smiles -- his still poised arm continues to<br>
    offer the challenge. A beat, Data calmly locks hands<br>
    with him. They hold position.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>

    Maw' tok.</p>
  <p> Data casually goes back to his PADD. The Klingon<br>
    stares at him for a beat, scowls, then violently lashes<br>
    forward with his headplate -- smashing right into<br>
    Data's forehead. Data doesn't even budge -- the<br>
    Klingon reels backwards, dazed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (in explanation)<br>
    My upper spinal support is a polyalloy<br>
    designed for extreme stress.<br>
    My skull is composed of cortenide<br>
    and duranium.</p>
  <p> Data looks back down at the PADD. The Klingon<br>
    recovers. He smiles, as if the ice has now been<br>
    broken.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    I understand your intellectual<br>
    prowess is equally impressive.</p>
  <p> Data glances up as the Klingon leans forward<br>
    conspiratorially, speaks almost in a whisper.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If I were to learn the results of<br>
    the computer search before the<br>
    others... It would give the<br>
    Klingon Empire a strategic<br>
    advantage.</p>

  <p> Data thinks for a moment. Then answers matter-of-factly.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are attempting to bribe me.</p>
  <p> The Klingon whips around toward the other tables, where<br>
    nearby patrons have overheard Data. The Klingon gives<br>
    them a toothy grin, then turns back to Data.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Not at all.</p>

    You dishonorable pah-tak...</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    We can exchange insults some other<br>
    time, perhaps. I'm a little busy<br>
    right now...</p>
  <p> Gul Ocett takes the sampling device off her belt and<br>
    starts edging backwards toward the lichen-covered<br>
    rockface...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/09/93 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>59 EXT. PLANET SURFACE</p>
  <p> As before, the Cardassians between the Away team and<br>
    the rockface, Gul Ocett slowly backing toward it.</p>
  <p> FOUR ROMULANS suddenly step out from behind the rocks,<br>
    weapons raised -- two have heavy-duty DISRUPTOR RIFLES.<br>
    The ROMULAN CAPTAIN smiles.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    It's been quite a chase, hasn't<br>
    it, my friends?</p>
  <p> The others just look at him, still taken aback by the<br>
    surprise arrival.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (stunned)<br>
    How... ?</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    We intercepted several communiques<br>
    between the Yridians and<br>
    Cardassia. My ship was watching<br>
    under cloak when Professor Galen's<br>
    shuttle was attacked.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You've been shadowing us ever<br>
    since.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    And now, the reward...<br>
    (to Gul Ocett)<br>
    Step clear, please.</p>
  <p> With superior firepower, the Romulans have the edge.<br>
    But Gul Ocett suddenly turns her weapon toward the<br>
    lichen-covered rocks.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    I'll destroy this entire<br>
    rockface... And all traces of DNA<br>
    with it.</p>
  <p> The Romulans freeze. The Romulan Captain loses his<br>
    smile.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You'll go back to Romulus emptyhanded.<br>
    Your superiors will be<br>
    quite pleased.</p>
  <p> It's a standoff.</p>

  <p>60 ON PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> The are standing off to one side, away from the<br>
    standoff. As the Romulan, Cardassian, and Klingon<br>
    continue their squabble in the b. g....</p>
  <p> Picard looks down at the dirt beneath his feet.</p>
  <p>60A INSERT - THE SEABED</p>
  <p> There are imprints and fossilized remains of vegetation --<br>
    it should look like a &quot;mold&quot; of a leaf or fern. There<br>
    should be a hint of greenish-brown coloring left on the<br>
    imprints.</p>
  <p>60B RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (sotto)<br>
    The seabed... it may be only<br>
    partially fossilized... it could<br>
    still contain organic material.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods slowly. She cautiously crouches down,<br>
    careful not to draw anyone's attention and scrapes at<br>
    the FOSSILIZED SEA BED with her sampling device...</p>
  <p>61 THE SCENE</p>
  <p> THIS SCENE IS THE BACKGROUND DIALOGUE TO BE PLAYED<br>
    UNDER SCENES 60 AND 62.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    (to Gul Ocett)<br>
    Perhaps we can compromise... Let<br>
    us have the gene code. And the<br>
    Romulans and the Cardassians will<br>
    share the result.</p>
  <p> The Cardassian considers.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    What's to stop you from killing me<br>
    as soon as I acquiesce?</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    You have my word.</p>
  <p> The Klingon Captain scowls.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT FIVE 63A.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    Etched in stone, no doubt.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    No terms. There will be no deals<br>
    as long as I'm still alive.</p>
  <p> The Romulan Captain motions to his men -- all of them<br>
    aim their disruptors directly at the Klingon.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    Then I have only one recourse...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/08/93 - ACT FIVE 64.</p>
  <p>62 ON PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> Picard is working the small computer -- Beverly's<br>
    sampling device is now attached to it. Picard reacts<br>
    to what he sees on the tiny screen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly, sotto)<br>
    The program has activated...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I think it's reconfiguring the<br>
    tricorder... it's modifying the<br>
    emitter diode to project<br>
    something...</p>
  <p>63 THE SCENE</p>
  <p> The Romulans have their four weapons trained on the<br>
    Klingon Captain, but he's not budging. A beat, then<br>
    Worf steps up next to the Klingon, phaser ready.<br>
    Another beat, Gul Ocett and her Cardassian guard take<br>
    a couple of steps, adding their weapons to the side of<br>
    the Romulans. It is now six against two.</p>
  <p> The Klingon Captain smiles.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    We die together, Brother. Tash-Koh-Tah.</p>
  <p> Nu'Daq is an instant away from firing.</p>
  <p>64 PICARD</p>
  <p> activates a control on the small computer, aiming it<br>
    toward the middle of the fray.</p>
  <p>65 THE SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard's computer SUDDENLY PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM directly<br>
    into the middle of the scene. It is a HUMANOID -- in<br>
    fact, one of the coolest humanoids we've ever seen,<br>
    with a face wise and tragic and light-hearted all at<br>
    once. It appears as if the flesh is life-like.<br>
    Everyone reacts, staring with amazement as it addresses<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT FIVE 64A.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HUMANOID<br>
    You are wondering who we are; why<br>
    we have done this; how it has come<br>
    that I stand before you, the image<br>
    of a being from so long ago.<br>

  <p>65 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HUMANOID (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Life evolved on my planet before<br>
    all others in this part of the<br>
    galaxy. We left our world,<br>
    explored the stars, and found none<br>
    like ourselves. We were alone.<br>
    Our civilization thrived for ages.<br>
    But what is the life of one race,<br>
    compared to the vast stretches of<br>
    cosmic time? We knew that someday<br>
    we would be gone. And that<br>
    nothing of us would survive. So<br>
    we left you.</p>
  <p> Everyone reacts.</p>
  <p> HUMANOID<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Our scientists seeded the<br>
    primordial oceans of many worlds,<br>
    where life was in its infancy.<br>
    These seed codes directed your<br>
    evolution toward a physical form<br>
    resembling ours -- this body you<br>
    see before you.</p>
  <p> The Humanoid opens her arms as if to indicate herself.</p>
  <p> HUMANOID<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Which is, of course, shaped as<br>
    yours is shaped. For you are the<br>
    end result. The seed codes also<br>
    contained this message, which we<br>
    scattered in fragments on many<br>
    different worlds. It was our hope<br>
    that you would have to come<br>
    together in cooperation and<br>
    fellowship in order to activate<br>
    this message. And if you can see<br>
    and hear me, our hope has been<br>
    fulfilled.</p>
  <p> After a few uneasy, guilty glances -- they know it<br>
    wasn't so peaceful and cooperative.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/08/93 - ACT FIVE 66.</p>
  <p>65 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> HUMANOID<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You are... a monument. Not to our<br>
    greatness, but to our existence.<br>
    That was our wish. That you too<br>
    would know life, and would keep<br>
    alive our memory. There is<br>
    something of us in each of you,<br>
    and so, something of you in each<br>
    other.</p>
  <p> A long pause. The Humanoid has a look of both joy and<br>
    deep sadness.</p>
  <p> HUMANOID<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Remember us...</p>
  <p> The hologram disappears. A long, silent beat.<br>
    Everyone stares at each other, lowering their<br>
    weapons... There's a sense that something magical could<br>
    take place, a melting away of all differences and<br>
    conflicts in a new spirit of fellowship --</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (livid)<br>
    That is all?</p>
  <p> The moment is shattered.</p>
  <p> NU'DAQ<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    If she were not dead, I would kill<br>
    her.</p>
  <p> Gul Ocett turns toward the Klingon Captain.</p>
  <p> GUL OCETT<br>
    The very notion. That Cardassians<br>
    could have anything in common with<br>
    Klingons.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It turns my stomach.</p>
  <p> Nu'Daq shoots her a dirty look. Everyone starts<br>
    contacting their respective ships.</p>

    Captain's log, Stardate 46735.2.<br>
    Our frequent use of high warp over<br>

    returning to Federation territory.</p>
  <p>67 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard and Beverly are at the end of their morning tea;<br>
    musing about the last few days.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a shame Professor Galen<br>
    wasn't able to see the end result<br>
    of his search...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I don't know of anyone who would<br>
    have appreciated it more.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If it hadn't been for you, Jean-Luc,<br>
    his dream to solve that<br>
    puzzle would never have been<br>
    realized. You gave him a<br>
    wonderful legacy...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It would've been a more fitting<br>
    legacy if the message had not<br>
    fallen on deaf ears.</p>
  <p> A reaction, clearly, that wasn't present on the<br>
    planet's surface. Beverly shrugs a wan smile.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You never know.</p>
  <p> She rises.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT FIVE 67A.</p>
  <p>67 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I have to get this day started.</p>
  <p> Picard stands in a gentlemanly gesture.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Both of us.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    See you this afternoon.</p>
  <p> Beverly heads for the door, it opens and she disappears<br>
    into the hallway. Picard sits back down for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Chase&quot; - REV. 02/05/93 - ACT FIVE 68.</p>

  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Riker to Captain Picard. Incoming<br>
    transmission from the Romulan<br>
    command ship.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts, puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    Put it through.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged.</p>

    Captain, my ships are leaving<br>
    orbit for Romulan space.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Until our next encounter...</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised by the overture.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until then.</p>
  <p> The Romulan pauses.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    It would seem that we are not<br>
    completely dissimilar after all...<br>
    in our hopes or in our fears...</p>
  <p> Picard nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> A long moment as the Romulan struggles with the words.</p>
  <p> ROMULAN CAPTAIN<br>
    Well, then. Perhaps one day...</p>
  <p> The Romulan seems to have gone as far as he can go with<br>
    this sentiment.</p>

  <p> The Romulan Captain nods. He turns toward an offscreen<br>
    underling -- the transmission ends.</p>
  <p> Picard turns back to his tea. He takes a sip, sets it<br>
    down, stares into space. OFF his quiet smile...</p>
