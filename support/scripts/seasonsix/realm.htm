    &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> holding position near a PLASMA STREAMER -- a vast twist<br>
    of highly-charged, gaseous matter connecting two binary<br>
    stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46041.1.<br>
    We have located the U.S.S.<br>
    Yosemite, a Starfleet science<br>
    vessel sent to the Igo Sector to<br>
    observe a remote plamsa streamer.<br>
    The ship has not been heard from<br>
    in several days.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> PICARD, RIKER, DATA, WORF and SUPERNUMERARIES at their<br>
    stations. There is a sense of urgency in the air.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> Worf works his console. The image on the viewscreen<br>
    shows the plasma streamer in which a Federation SCIENCE<br>
    VESSEL, is trapped.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    The last report we have says they<br>
    were observing the streamer at<br>
    medium range. Maybe they went<br>
    in for a closer look... got more<br>
    than they bargained for.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No response.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Life signs?</p>
  <p> Data works his console.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our scanners cannot penetrate the<br>
    plasma streamer's distortion<br>
    field.</p>
  <p> Picard considers the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we tractor the vessel out?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir -- the ionic interference<br>
    is too heavy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'll take a shuttle.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Too risky -- you could be pulled<br>
    in, too.<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    Bridge to Engineering -- Geordi,<br>
    can we beam an Away Team onto the<br>
    science ship?</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI is at his controls, REGINALD BARCLAY a couple<br>
    of panels down; other N.D. ENGINEERS are also working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can beam them over there,<br>
    Captain -- but with all this<br>
    interference, we might not get<br>
    a positive lock to bring them<br>
    back.</p>
  <p> Barclay gets an idea, turns to Geordi.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Commander... what if we bridged<br>
    our Transporter system with<br>
    theirs? It might be enough to<br>
    cut through the ionic field.</p>
  <p> Geordi thinks.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    To do that, we'd have to activate<br>
    the Yosemite's Transporters by<br>
    remote...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (quick)<br>
    No problem, sir. I can<br>
    reconfigure their controller to<br>
    accept commands from here.</p>
  <p> Geordi is sold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea, Reg.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Captain, I think we can do it.<br>
    We're gonna bridge the two<br>
    Transporter systems.</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged. Meet Commander<br>
    Riker in Transporter Room Three.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye sir.<br>
    (to Barclay, on the<br>
    move)<br>
    Barclay -- I'll need a systems'<br>
    engineer on this Away Team.</p>
  <p> Barclay hesitates -- he doesn't want to join this Away<br>
    Team, tries to stall.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'll ask Ensign Dern to join you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I meant you, Barclay.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Shouldn't I stay here and set up<br>
    the remote link?</p>
  <p> Geordi motions to Ensign Dern.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Dern can handle that. Let's go.</p>
  <p> Barclay hesitates, but he has no choice. He stands<br>
    to follow Geordi, looking a little worried -- and the<br>
    reason will soon be clear. They EXIT.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf and BEVERLY ENTER. Geordi and O'BRIEN are<br>
    working the console. A few feet away, Barclay has a<br>
    wall panel open and is re-working isolinear chips --<br>
    he looks distracted by something. Riker stops at<br>
    Geordi and O'Brien.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Status, Mister O'Brien?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You're in for a bumpy ride,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts to the comment, alarmed -- listens to<br>
    the rest of the conversation with growing concern...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll have to send you over one<br>
    at a time... because of band-width<br>
    limitations. And the transport<br>
    cycle will take a bit longer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How much longer?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Four, five seconds... about twice<br>
    the normal time.</p>
  <p> Barclay closes the wall panel and joins the others.<br>
    He tries to play it cool, like nothing's wrong.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    What do you... what exactly do<br>
    you mean by a bumpy ride?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    There may be a small amount of<br>
    static charge accumulation.<br>
    You'll feel a bit of tingling --<br>
    nothing to worry about.</p>
  <p> Barclay nods -- more worried than ever.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's do it.</p>
  <p> Riker steps up onto the Transporter stage. Barclay<br>
    stands a few feet behind the others, trying to hide<br>
    his nervousness.</p>
  <p> O'Brien works the console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Engaging system interlock...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Pattern buffers synchronized...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> A HUMMING SOUND begins as the Transporter system<br>
    charges up -- and builds in intensity...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Phase transition coils at<br>
    stand-by...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Energizing.</p>
  <p> Riker DEMATERIALZES in a Transporter effect that is<br>
    noticeably longer and louder than normal. O'Brien<br>
    closely monitors his console. After a beat, he looks<br>
    satisfied.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    He's there.</p>
  <p> Without hesitation, Worf steps onto the Transporter<br>
    stage...</p>
  <p>5 INTERCUT: ANGLE FAVORING BARCLAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the process begins again. He watches, trying to<br>
    stay calm... but every detail of the process -- every<br>
    sight and sound -- seems to intensify his discomfort.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN (O.S.)<br>
    Engaging interlock...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Buffers synched...</p>
  <p> Again, the HUMMING NOISE builds...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Energizing.</p>
  <p> We HEAR the sound of Worf dematerializing. Barclay<br>
    draws in a deep breath to calm himself. He doesn't<br>
    want to do this...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll go next.</p>
  <p> Beverly steps onto the stage.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Engaging interlock...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Buffers synched...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien reacts to his console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Whoa, wait a minute...<br>
    (works, confident)<br>
    I'm reading an ionic fluctuation<br>
    in the matter stream... No<br>
    problem.</p>
  <p> O'Brien works, not too concerned.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Okay... Energizing.</p>
  <p> Beverly DEMATERIALIZES. Barclay reacts, dismayed by<br>
    the complication. He's broken out in a sweat now...<br>
    and it's all he can do to keep himself from leaving<br>
    the room...</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    Barclay.</p>
  <p> Barclay jumps, startled. Geordi motions to the<br>
    Transporter stage: &quot;Your turn.&quot; It's an awful moment<br>
    for Barclay -- he doesn't want to reveal his true<br>
    feelings about this -- but what can he do?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Aye sir...</p>
  <p> He braces himself, walks toward the stage... steps onto<br>
    the stage... places his feet within a transport pad...<br>
    closes his eyes...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Engaging interlock...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Buffers in synch...</p>
  <p> The HUMMING NOISE builds. Barclay tenses up... readies<br>
    himself for the most dreadful experience of his life...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Phase coils...</p>
  <p> Then, in an instant, Barclay is overcome with panic.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm sorry -- I can't do this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Barclay steps down off the stage, quickly EXITS.<br>
    Geordi and O'Brien watch him go, surprised. As they<br>
    exchange a confused glance...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE 8-8A. </p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>6 INT. TROI'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> TROI is talking to Barclay, who looks depressed by<br>
    recent events. He's moving around the room, picking<br>
    up objects and setting them down, anything to take the<br>
    weight off of the moment. Troi tries to reassure him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You were faced with a difficult<br>
    transport, Reg. Anyone would have<br>
    been apprehensive in that<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> Barclay is despondent.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Tell that to Commander La Forge<br>
    and the rest of the Away Team...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sure they understand. As soon<br>
    as you feel up to it, you can<br>
    probably still join them --</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Troi reacts, sensing a deeper issue at hand.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Reg... is there something you're<br>
    not telling me?</p>
  <p> Barclay shifts, uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Actually, this isn't the first<br>
    time I've been... apprehensive.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Every single time I've had to do<br>
    it, I've had a certain feeling<br>
    of... I guess you could call it...<br>
    (finds the words)<br>
    ... mortal terror.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see. How long have you had this<br>
    fear of transporting?</p>
  <p> Barclay shakes his head and shrugs -- his look says<br>
    that this is a serious problem for him. Troi<br>
    considers.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Why have you kept it a secret?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Why? My career in Starfleet would<br>
    be over, that's why.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I doubt that.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I usually manage to avoid it<br>
    somehow. You wouldn't believe<br>
    how many hours I've logged on<br>
    shuttlecrafts...<br>
    (shudders)<br>
    The thought of being deconstructed<br>
    molecule by molecule. It's more<br>
    than I can stand...</p>
  <p> Barclay sits down, dejected.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Ever since I was a child, I've<br>
    been scared to death that if I<br>
    ever dematerialized... I wouldn't<br>
    come back whole again.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I know it sounds crazy.</p>
  <p> Troi is reassuring.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's nothing crazy about it,<br>
    Reg -- you are being taken apart<br>
    molecule by molecule. You're not<br>
    the first person to have anxiety<br>
    about transporting.</p>
  <p> Barclay listens intently, wanting to hear more.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    We can desensitize you to this<br>
    type of fear. It's a slow and<br>
    gradual process... but it works.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    It does... how?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well... the first step might<br>
    be a relaxation technique. Like<br>
    Plexing.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Plexing?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It's a Betazoid method. The next<br>
    time you feel nervous about<br>
    transporting, you would stimulate<br>
    a neural pressure point -- like<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> Troi demonstrates by quickly tapping her neck with her<br>
    index and middle fingers in the region just behind her<br>
    jaw.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's a nerve cluster just<br>
    behind the carotid artery -- it<br>
    stimulates the part of the brain<br>
    that releases natural endorphins.</p>
  <p> Intrigued, Barclay gives it a try -- he briskly taps<br>
    his neck.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Plexing... sounds easy enough...</p>
  <p> Barclay stops tapping, breathes a sigh of relief. He<br>
    stands, driven by a rush of confidence.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You know, I feel better already.<br>
    I can do this.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Reg... there's no need to rush...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No, no, no. We've talked before<br>
    about confronting my fears. &quot;The<br>
    best way out is through.&quot; You<br>
    said that once, remember?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I suppose I did...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm going to beam over there.<br>
    I can do it.</p>
  <p> OFF Barclay's determination...</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - THE SCIENCE SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> trapped inside the gaseous layers of the plasma<br>
    streamer.</p>
  <p>8 INT. SCIENCE SHIP - OPS</p>
  <p> The darkened room is heavily DAMAGED, as if by an<br>
    explosion. Charred black walls... overturned<br>
    equipment... no sign of a crew. Beverly is searching<br>
    the room... Geordi is studying a damaged console as<br>
    Riker and Worf ENTER from an adjoining corridor, having<br>
    completed a search of the science station.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No sign of survivors. No sign<br>
    of a anyone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe they abandoned ship.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Unlikely. Both escape pods are<br>
    still on board.</p>
  <p> A beat as they consider. Geordi indicates the room.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, there was an explosion in<br>
    here. We know that much.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any idea what caused it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've ruled out a reactor core<br>
    failure... and there's no sign<br>
    of a systems overload.</p>
  <p> Worf begins to scan the room with his tricorder, waving<br>
    it past the floor and ceiling and walls. He stops at<br>
    a wall with nasty-looking burn marks on it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    Blast analysis indicates the<br>
    explosion originated...</p>
  <p> Worf follows his scan across the room... down along<br>
    the wall... and stops with his tricorder pointed at<br>
    the center of the Transporter chamber.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ...here. In the center of this<br>
    transport chamber.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How is that possible? The<br>
    Transporter is still functional.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could someone have beamed an<br>
    explosive device aboard?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> They consider the implications.</p>

    How did he die?</p>
  <p> Beverly completes her scan, stands up.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's evidence of burns... but<br>
    they don't look serious enough<br>
    to have killed him... I'm going<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You're sure about this, sir?</p>

    but not doing a very good job of it.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm sure. Please proceed.</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Should be a smooth ride over, sir.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>

    I know how you feel about this,<br>

  <p> Barclay is surprised.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You... you're afraid of<br>
    transporting?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No -- of arachnids.<br>
    (off Barclay's look)<br>
    Spiders. Sickening, crawly little<br>
    things, don't you think? All<br>
    those legs...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    They've never bothered me.</p>
  <p> O'Brien keeps working.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    A few years back, I was called<br>
    in to re-route an emitter array<br>
    at a Starbase on Zayra Four.<br>
    Turns out the entire system was<br>
    infested with Talarian hook<br>
    spiders.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Ever see a Talarian hook spider?</p>
  <p> Barclay shakes his head, no.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Their legs are half a meter long.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Anyway, I had a choice. Do I walk<br>
    away and let the emitter blow<br>
    itself to hell... or do I crawl<br>
    into a Jeffries Tube with twenty<br>
    hook spiders?</p>
  <p> Barclay is hanging onto every word.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    What happened?</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It was the hardest thing I ever<br>
    did. But I got through it. After<br>
    that, I was never quite as afraid<br>
    of spiders.</p>
  <p> O'Brien's words have an effect on Barclay, who derives<br>
    a swell of courage from the story. He looks at the<br>
    Transporter platform and takes a deep breath.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Thanks...</p>
  <p> Barclay walks toward the Transporter platform... stops<br>
    and braces himself... every step is an event...</p>
  <p> He steps up onto the stage... finds a Transporter<br>
    pad... Play the suspense as Barclay waits for the<br>
    moment to come. He starts to tap his neck, plexing as<br>
    he did in Troi's quarters. Tap, tap, tap...</p>
  <p> O'Brien works the controls and the Transporter system<br>
    HUMS to life. The HUMMING grows louder. Barclay stops<br>
    tapping -- it isn't helping. He's sweating now...<br>
    heart pounding... terrified. O'Brien waves a hand over<br>
    the console.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    are seeing what it feels like to transport. Barclay<br>
    winces at the awful experience, but keeps his eyes open,<br>
    looking around, alert the entire time. After a few<br>
    seconds, we see Barclay himself start to PHASE OUT, as<br>
    his body is broken down into molecules...</p>

  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Barclay's confusion gives way to relief: he made it.<br>
    He moves to a wall, opens a panel, and starts to scan<br>
    the isolinear chips with a tricorder.</p>

    anything?</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates several metal FRAGMENTS that are<br>
    scattered on the floor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I don't know how these fit in,<br>
    but... I found them near the<br>

  <p> Geordi nods, collecting the fragments. Riker crosses<br>
    to the room. He passes Barclay along the way, gives<br>
    him a friendly nod.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Glad you could join us, Mister<br>

  <p> as the science ship begins to DISSOLVE AWAY into<br>

    How many Transporter accidents<br>
    have there been in the last ten<br>
    years, Reg? Two... three? What<br>
    about the millions of people who<br>
    transport every day without a<br>
    problem?</p>
  <p> Barclay thinks for a moment... he's feeling better,<br>
    but still...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I've... I've heard about<br>
    problems... what about...<br>
    Transporter Psychosis?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    Transporter Psychosis -- there<br>
    hasn't been a case of that in over<br>
    fifty years. Not since they<br>
    perfected multiplex pattern<br>

  <p> Barclay listens -- their words are having an effect.<br>
    OFF his face as he starts to unwind...</p>
  <p>24A INT. SICKBAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Beverly and NURSE OGAWA are performing an AUTOPSY on<br>
    Lieutenant Kelly, the dead male crewmember. The<br>
    body is laid out under the clamshell. Ogawa watches a<br>
    nearby MONITOR, which displays various data.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I want to take a closer look at<br>
    those burns.<br>
    (to Ogawa)<br>
    Take a tissue sample.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Ogawa hits a few commands into the console -- the<br>
    overhead donut sends out a thin LASER that sweeps<br>
    across the body. Beverly reads the data as it scrolls<br>
    across the clamshell.</p>

  <p> Ogawa picks up a hypospray, presses it to the body's<br>
    neck, and injects. Just then something catches Ogawa'a<br>
    eye -- the body's fingers are twitching. She stops,<br>
    startled.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    Doctor Crusher...</p>
  <p> Without warning, the monitor display LIGHTS UP and<br>
    BEEPS, indicating that a heartbeat has begun. Beverly<br>
    reacts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    His heart is beating.</p>
  <p> A stunned beat -- then Beverly's instincts take over.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Cardio-stimulator -- now.</p>
  <p> Beverly rushes to a nearby table, grabs a<br>
    cardio-stimulator, and applies it to the body's chest.<br>
    They work to revive the body. On the monitor, the<br>
    heartbeat display goes dead. They react.</p>
  <p> OGAWA<br>
    It's gone.</p>

    (astonished)<br>
    Now the respiratory system's<br>
    active. What the hell's going<br>

  <p> On the monitor, the respiratory display goes dead and<br>
    the medical console COMES ALIVE all at once in a<br>

  <p> Barclay ENTERS and stops at the bar. A BARTENDER walks<br>
    over.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (to bartender)<br>
    Just water, please.</p>
  <p> The bartender moves off. Barclay looks around the<br>
    room, finally starting to relax. The bartender returns<br>
    with his water.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Barclay crosses to a table, settles into a chair. A<br>
    quiet beat as he takes a sip of water... looking<br>
    around... unwinding... Suddenly, he looks down at his<br>
    left arm and grabs it, as if in pain...</p>

  <p>26 BARCLAY'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> of his arm, as it RADIATES with a SPARKLING LIGHT in<br>
    the exact same spot where the creature touched him --<br>
    a vague impression, like a smudge. The light vanishes<br>
    just as quickly.</p>
  <p>27 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> As Barclay reacts, startled by the sight. He glances<br>
    around the room -- no one has seen the vision but him.<br>
    Barclay starts to say something, thinks better of it,<br>

  <p> Barclay ENTERS, looking troubled and shaken. He<br>

    replicator slot.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>

    Water, ten degrees celsius.</p>
  <p> A glass of water MATERIALIZES. He picks up the glass<br>
    and takes a long drink, moves to a nearby chair and<br>
    sits down. He's restless, panicky -- any peace of mind<br>
    he once had is gone. He fidgets for a moment, at a<br>
    loss...</p>
  <p> Then Barclay gets an idea -- he stands and starts to<br>
    pace around the room.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer... access Starfleet<br>

    Transporter Psychosis was<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    It is caused by a breakdown of<br>
    neuro-chemical molecules during<br>
    transport, affecting the body's<br>
    motor functions, autonomic<br>
    systems, and the brain's higher<br>
    reasoning centers.</p>
  <p> Barclay unconsciously touches his head. What he's<br>
    heard is morbid and scary, but he's compelled to know<br>
    more.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    What are the symptoms?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Victims suffer from paranoid<br>
    delusions... multi-infarct<br>
    dementia... hallucinations...</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Hallucinations? What kind of<br>
    hallucinations?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Victims experience somatic,<br>
    tactile and visual hallucinations,<br>
    accompanied by psychogenic<br>
    hysteria.</p>
  <p> It sounds awful. Barclay is really getting worried<br>
    now. He moves around the room as if the walls are<br>
    closing in on him.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Peripheral symptoms include<br>
    sleeplessness... accelerated<br>

    Forward, remembering the sensation he had...</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And in most cases, dehydration.</p>
  <p> Barclay glances at the glass of water he's holding,<br>
    alarmed, quickly sets it down. His mind is working...<br>
    and we can tell by the expression on his face that he's<br>
    convinced he has the disorder.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The autopsy showed residual<br>
    ionization in every one of<br>
    Lieutenant Kelly's systems.<br>
    I think that's what caused<br>
    the muscular and systemic<br>
    contractions.</p>
  <p> A beat as they take in the chilling image.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where did this ionization come<br>

  <p> Geordi reacts.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Plasma? There's no way they<br>
    could've been exposed... unless<br>
    it was matter from the streamer...</p>
  <p> Picard thinks.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is there any evidence of a hull<br>

    the ship?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No...<br>

    Data, what's the report on that<br>
    broken sample container?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The analysis of the fragments is<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    Captain -- if there's evidence<br>
    of similar ionization in those<br>
    fragments... it could mean they<br>
    tried to beam aboard material from<br>
    the streamer...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    And if the plasma exploded... that<br>
    would explain a few things.<br>

  <p> at the plasma streamer.</p>
  <p>32 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi, Barclay and Data are examining the metal<br>
    fragments (as seen in Act One) -- but now the fragments<br>
    have been roughly put together to form a matter sample<br>
    container. Barclay looks exhausted, barely able to<br>
    focus on the task at hand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    From the looks of these fracture<br>
    patterns, I'd say the explosive<br>
    force came from within the<br>
    container.</p>
  <p> Data completes a scan.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT THREE 33.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    The container does show evidence<br>
    of residual ionization.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I believe your hypothesis was<br>
    correct. It was being used to<br>
    store high energy plasma.</p>
  <p> Geordi considers.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So they were collecting samples<br>
    from the plasma streamer...<br>
    (perplexed)<br>
    But they were using the proper<br>
    container. How could it have<br>
    exploded?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we should try to recreate<br>
    their experiment to see what<br>
    happens when matter is beamed<br>
    aboard under similar conditions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea. Let's prepare a new<br>
    container.<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    Reg, I don't want to take any<br>
    chances -- start setting up a<br>
    level five containment field here<br>
    in Engineering.</p>
  <p> Barclay glances over -- his mind is elsewhere.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Aye sir...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves to his office. Barclay and Data start<br>
    to work a nearby console. Barclay is on edge,<br>
    distracted -- every move he makes is slow and<br>
    deliberate, as if any second he might lose his balance.</p>
  <p> Barclay picks up a PADD to make a calculation. As he<br>
    reads the screen, he moves the PADD to and fro while<br>
    alternately blinking each eye -- as if he's testing<br>
    his eyesight. Data glances at him, genuinely curious.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you having trouble with your<br>
    eyesight, Mister Barclay?</p>
  <p> Barclay is embarrassed at having been caught.</p>

  <p> Barclay picks up a nearby bottle of water (which he<br>
    has brought with him) and takes a long, thirsty drink.<br>
    He crosses to a JEFFERIES TUBE near the Pool Table,<br>
    enters the tube. Data eyes him with growing concern,<br>
    then crosses to Geordi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I have a word with you,<br>
    Geordi? It concerns Lieutenant<br>
    Barclay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He appears to be inordinately<br>
    preoccupied with his physiological<br>
    condition. I have seen him check<br>
    his pulse rate, as well as his<br>
    visual acuity several times in<br>
    the last twenty minutes.</p>
  <p> Concerned, Geordi crosses to the Jefferies Tube, sees<br>

    plexing... takes a few manic breaths... violently<br>
    fluffs his pillow... straightens the wrinkles out of<br>
    his blanket... then crawls under the covers. He shuts<br>
    his eyes...</p>
  <p> And tosses and turns, trying to get comfortable in the<br>
    bed... finally finds the right position... settles in<br>
    for the night. The soft music keeps playing... Barclay<br>
    tries to sleep...</p>
  <p> He opens his eyes and looks down at his left arm, where<br>
    a tingling sensation is slowly building. He touches<br>
    it... dreading... He flings off the blanket --</p>
  <p>36 BARCLAY'S ARM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> is RADIATING with the SPARKLING LIGHT (as seen in Act<br>
    Two). Only this time, the glowing imprint has spread<br>
    to include his shoulder and neck. Barclay cries out,<br>
    jumps out of bed. The glow VANISHES.</p>
  <p> Barclay's expression changes... as an inner resolve<br>
    takes over. His fear transforms into grim<br>
    determination. He refuses to end up a victim of<br>
    whatever's happening to him. His fear compels him to<br>
    take action.</p>

  <p>38 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Barclay is at the console, studying a read-out of the<br>
    transport logs. O'Brien ENTERS, looking like he just<br>
    woke up.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sir, begging your pardon -- but<br>
    couldn't this wait til morning?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> Barclay turns to him, trying to act casual.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Chief... I've just... I've been<br>
    reviewing the transport logs...<br>
    (indicates console)<br>
    What are these... energy<br>
    variations that keep appearing?<br>
    There was one when I transported<br>
    to the science ship... see?</p>
  <p> O'Brien glances at the logs.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    They're just ionic fluctuations,<br>
    sir. A result of our interlock<br>
    with the Yosemite's transporter<br>
    system.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    A fluctuation occurred while I<br>
    was inside the matter stream... ?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It's nothing to worry about, sir.</p>
  <p> Barclay looks at him, determined.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I need you to transport me to the<br>
    science ship... and directly back<br>
    again. And while I'm in the<br>
    beam... can you recreate one of<br>
    those ionic fluctuations... ?</p>

    wants some tricorder readings of<br>
    those fluctuations.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is suspicious -- he senses Barclay's anxiety.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    We can do it from right here.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (scrambling)<br>
    No, I... the Transporter sensors<br>
    may not be sensitive enough...</p>
  <p> But Barclay isn't fooling anybody, and he knows it.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm giving you an order, Mister<br>
    O'Brien.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    You forgot to bring a tricorder.</p>
  <p> Barclay looks down, realizes O'Brien's right... and<br>
    finally lets down his guard. He gestures to the<br>
    Transporter platform.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Either there's something in<br>

    Beverly is standing beside him, taking tricorder scans<br>
    of his left arm.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Then I saw it again -- just twenty<br>
    minutes ago. The same exact thing<br>
    moving around in the Transporter<br>
    beam.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let me get this straight -- you<br>
    think it was alive?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (nods)<br>
    It was dark and distorted... and<br>
    it had what looked like... a<br>
    mouth...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (dubious)<br>
    A mouth?</p>
  <p> A tense beat. Beverly completes the scan of his arm.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't see anything wrong with<br>
    his arm.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Reg -- why did you wait so long<br>

    Well... I thought I was<br>

    I was the only one to experience<br>
    an ionic fluctuation during<br>

    it.</p>
  <p> Picard throws a questioning look at Geordi, who shrugs<br>
    -- he's sorry to have to put Barclay on the spot like<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We ran a full diagnostic on the<br>

    We've been conducting intensive<br>

  <p> Picard considers. Doubt in the room is growing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Barclay, I understand<br>
    you've been under a considerable<br>
    amount of strain the past couple<br>
    of days. Isn't it possible you<br>
    simply imagined --</p>
  <p> Barclay stands, cutting him off, undaunted.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I know what you're going to say,<br>
    sir. And I realize... I know I've<br>
    been acting strangely. But you've<br>
    got to believe me. I wouldn't<br>
    have called you in here if I<br>
    weren't absolutely certain.</p>
  <p> Barclay looks at Picard, waiting for the verdict. A<br>
    long beat as Picard takes Barclay's measure -- decides<br>
    to take Barclay at his word. He turns to his staff,<br>
    rapidly issues commands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Commander La Forge, get Chief<br>
    O'Brien -- take the Transporter<br>

    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    I'll run a micro-cellular scan<br>
    on Mister Barclay's arm. It'll<br>

    something wrong, I'll find it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Keep me apprised. Dismissed.</p>
  <p> They all stand to go. Barclay is awash with relief.<br>
    Off his look of appreciation to Picard...</p>
  <p>43 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Barclay sitting on a bio-bed. Beverly is moving a<br>
    special medical DEVICE over Barclay's left arm. She<br>
    moves the device up his arm... around his shoulder...<br>

    getting worried.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS. Beverly deactivates the scanner, turns<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (re: Barclay)<br>
    I'm reading minute levels of<br>

    in the sample container from the<br>

    (turns to Barclay)<br>
    There's no question -- you've been<br>

  <p>43 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts -- he's been vindicated.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So... something did happen to me<br>
    in the Transporter beam?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's too early to draw<br>
    conclusions... you might've been<br>
    exposed to something on the<br>
    science ship. But you did say<br>
    something touched your left arm<br>
    during transport... and that's<br>
    where the ionization is<br>
    focused...</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Does this ionization pose a threat<br>
    to Mister Barclay?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It might. I'll need to run a<br>
    base-pair correlation to look for<br>
    signs of DNA break-down.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Sir... Commander La Forge and I<br>
    were planning to recreate the<br>
    circumstances of the explosion<br>
    on the Yosemite... that might<br>
    give us some answers. Permission<br>
    to continue with the experiment?</p>
  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Granted. Tell Chief O'Brien to<br>
    take all primary Transporters<br>
    off-line. I don't want to risk<br>
    any further... contaminations.<br>
    And make sure you take the<br>
    necessary safety precautions.</p>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I want you to wear this<br>

    Okay... what would they have done<br>
    first?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A standard analysis begins with<br>
    a resonance frequency scan.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Data works a nearby console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Initiating resonance sweep.<br>

  <p> Without warning, the sample container walls BLOW<br>
    OUTWARD with a tremendous BLAST -- the containment<br>
    force field FLASHES, expanding against the pressure of<br>
    the explosion. The force sends Geordi, Data and<br>
    Barclay stumbling backward.</p>
  <p> They regain their composure. Although the sample<br>
    container is shattered, the containment field is<br>
    holding. Inside, the plasma sample has transformed --<br>
    we now see several intensely glowing PARTICLES,<br>
    pulsating with energy, hitting up against the<br>
    containment field, as if trying to escape.</p>

    That is correct. They appear to<br>

    made them undetectable to our<br>
    sensors.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They didn't come out until we<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Your pattern might degrade to the<br>
    point where your signal would be<br>
    permanently lost.</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts -- this is his ultimate fear come true.<br>
    He stands and starts moving about the room, agonizing<br>
    over what to do...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    This has been the thing I've been<br>
    afraid of all my life... that I'd<br>
    go in and not come back...</p>
  <p> Barclay struggles -- it's the toughest choice he's ever<br>
    had to make. He lets out a nervous laugh.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    But I guess... if I'm ever going<br>
    to confront my fear, it might<br>
    as well be now...</p>
  <p> A long beat. Then his face sets with a look of<br>
    inner-resolve. He's made the decision...</p>
  <p>46 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Barclay ENTERS. Beverly is with him, medical gear<br>
    at-the-ready. Geordi and O'Brien are working at the<br>
    console.</p>
  <p> O'Brien looks at Barclay, tries to reassure.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    After fifteen seconds or so in<br>
    the beam, you may start to feel<br>
    lightheaded. Try to stay calm...<br>
    and it's important you don't<br>
    move around too much.</p>
  <p> Barclay nods, swallows nervously.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>46 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> They watch as Barclay approaches the Transporter<br>

    a pad...</p>

    Initializing the back-up pattern<br>

  <p> O'Brien works the controls. The system HUMS to life.<br>
    Barclay tenses. This is the most terrifying moment<br>
    in his entire life.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    You ready, Reg?</p>
  <p> Barclay nods, takes a deep breath.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> O'Brien works the controls. Barclay begins to<br>
    DEMATERIALIZE...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>47 CLOSE ON BARCLAY - TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (Transporter Room side) The world around him DISSOLVES<br>
    into SPARKLES OF ENERGY -- the Transporter Room barely<br>
    visible against the shimmering light. Barclay tries to<br>
    stay calm and motionless... a second passes... then<br>
    Barclay starts to PHASE OUT...</p>
  <p>48 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Continuous. Geordi and O'Brien working, tense.<br>
    Beverly works a nearby console.</p>

  <p>52 INT. TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous. Barclay terrified as the life form comes<br>
    closer and closer, snaking through the streaks of<br>
    energy, its distorted body and mouth-like orifice<br>
    barely discernible. Barclay doesn't move, stares<br>
    wide-eyed at the thing as it stops just inches from<br>
    his face...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    His signal resolution's down to<br>

    him back...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    This won't hurt a bit, Reg...</p>
  <p>54 INT. TRANSPORTER EFFECT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> (Transporter side) Continuous. Barclay gaping at the<br>
    life form. The thing hovers there for a moment. Then<br>
    it starts to tilt and move its body, as if trying to<br>
    communicate -- like it's supplicating. And it should<br>
    be clear at this close range that there is something<br>
    vaguely human about this creature -- it seems to be<br>
    asking for something...</p>
  <p> Barclay watches it intently... then something else<br>
    catches his eye. He looks, and sees a second CREATURE,<br>
    similar in appearance, quickly moving through the<br>
    sparkles.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT FIVE 57A.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts to the sight... gradually coming to<br>
    a realization. The sparkles start to give way to<br>
    the Transporter Room, indicating that Barclay is<br>
    returning -- BARCLAY GRABS HOLD OF THE FIRST CREATURE.</p>

  <p>55 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Continuous. Barclay is just starting to MATERIALIZE<br>
    on the platform -- he appears to be holding onto<br>
    something, his arms wrapped around it, but we can't<br>
    quite make out what it is...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (alarmed)<br>
    I'm reading a ninety-two percent<br>
    increase in mass, sir!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    Something's in the beam with<br>

    (taps communicator)<br>
    Security to Transporter Room<br>
    Three!</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (working)<br>
    I'm setting up a force field<br>
    around the chamber...</p>
  <p> We HEAR a force field activate. They look at the<br>
    platform --</p>
  <p>56 TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Barclay PHASES IN AND OUT for a second... then<br>
    MATERIALIZES all the way. HE IS HOLDING A HUMAN BEING<br>
    -- A SCIENCE SHIP CREWMEMBER. They both slump onto<br>
    the platform.</p>
  <p> Reactions. Beverly rushes to their aid.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to O'Brien, on the<br>
    move)<br>
    Drop the force field.</p>
  <p> O'Brien works and we HEAR the force field deactivate.<br>
    The crewmember lifts his head and looks around him,<br>
    groggy and exhausted...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/20/92 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf and TWO SECURITY NDS ENTER and rush to the<br>
    platform. Barclay gets to his feet, moves to them,<br>
    urgent.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (to Worf, security NDs)<br>
    There are more of them in the<br>
    beam... you have to grab them<br>
    and hold on...</p>
  <p> Worf nods in understanding -- he moves with the<br>
    security NDs onto the platform. O'Brien works the<br>
    console. We HEAR the security team dematerialize.</p>
  <p>56A ON GEORDI AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> who are tending to the crewmember. Barclay moves to<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    Reg, what happened?</p>
  <p> Barclay catches his breath.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    When I saw there was more than<br>
    one of them... I thought... maybe<br>
    the other crew was trying the<br>
    same thing we were...</p>
  <p> The crewmember, still shaken, chimes in.</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>
    We were infected with<br>
    something... Lieutenant Kelly...<br>
    tried to reprogram the<br>
    bio-filter...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/20/92 - ACT FIVE 59A.</p>
  <p>56A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to crewmember)<br>
    It looks like he increased<br>
    molecular dispersion past the<br>
    integrity point... your patterns<br>
    were lost in the beam.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (realizes)<br>
    The residual energy from the<br>
    plasma streamer... it must've<br>
    amplified the charge in the<br>
    buffer... enough to keep your<br>
    patterns from degrading...</p>
  <p> The crewmember nods, exhausted. We HEAR the security<br>
    team start to materialize...</p>
  <p>56B TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Worf and the two security NDs beam in. They are<br>
    each holding an exhausted-looking science ship<br>
    CREWMEMBER.</p>
  <p> Geordi lays a hand on Barclay's shoulder. It's a nice<br>
    moment for Barclay. OFF his tired but satisfied<br>
    expression...</p>

  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46043.6.<br>
    The reprogrammed bio-filter was<br>
    effective in removing the alien<br>
    microbes from Mister Barclay and<br>
    the four crewmembers. The<br>
    microbes have been returned to<br>
    the plasma streamer.</p>

  <p>59 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Continuous. Barclay ENTERS and spots O'Brien sitting<br>
    at a table. He crosses to him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - REV. 7/17/92 - ACT FIVE 59B.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Chief...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Lieutenant -- glad you could make<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Barclay sits. On the table top, O'Brien has a small<br>
    BOX of some sort (the 24th century version of a cage).<br>
    O'Brien looks at Barclay.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You know, I think this is the<br>
    first time we've ever talked,<br>
    outside the Transporter Room.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Barclay looks a little embarrassed.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Well... to be honest, I always<br>
    avoided you.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Because... you run the<br>
    Transporters, and I hate<br>
    transporters...</p>
  <p> Barclay considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    At least... I used to...</p>
  <p> O'Brien smiles, glad to hear it. Barclay returns the<br>
    smile, grateful for O'Brien's help. He indicates the<br>
    box.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    So what's in the box?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I thought you might like to meet<br>
    Christina.</p>
  <p> Barclay looks at him, curious. O'Brien removes the<br>
    top of the box to reveal its contents: a rather large,<br>
    nasty-looking TARANTULA. Barclay reacts, surprised<br>
    by the sight.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Christina -- Lieutenant Barclay.</p>
  <p> Barclay eyes the thing.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Your... pet spider.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Lycosa tarantula. Don't worry,<br>
    she won't bite.</p>
  <p> The tarantula takes a few crawly steps onto the table.<br>
    Barclay shifts, uncomfortable.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    It's... she's... very... large.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Realm of Fear&quot; - 7/15/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I found her on Titus Four...<br>
    almost stepped on her by accident.</p>
  <p> Barclay nods, trying to seem enthusiastic. O'Brien<br>
    stands up.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'll get us a couple of drinks.<br>
    Keep an eye on her, will you?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Sure...</p>
  <p> O'Brien crosses to the bar. Barclay looks down and<br>
    freezes when he notices that the tarantula is crawling<br>
    onto his hand. A flicker of panic crosses his face.<br>
    With his free hand, he starts to tap his neck,<br>
    plexing... trying to stay calm...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Um... Chief...</p>
  <p> As the spider crawls up his arm...</p>
