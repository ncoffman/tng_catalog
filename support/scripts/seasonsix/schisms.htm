    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at impulse in a vast and starry region.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46154.2.<br>
    The Enterprise has entered the<br>
    Amargosa Diaspora, an unusually<br>
    dense globular cluster. We are<br>
    faced with the daunting task of<br>
    charting this vast region.</p>
  <p>2 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> RIKER is lying in bed, just starting to wake up. He<br>
    lies there a moment, groggy, staring into middle<br>
    distance... then finally sits up. Every move is a<br>
    struggle. He swings his legs over the bed... rubs his<br>
    hands over his face... yawns... he just can't get<br>
    going...</p>
  <p> He stands up and stretches... slowly crosses the<br>
    room...</p>
  <p>3 ANGLE ON SINK AREA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker enters and activates the sink. He splashes cold<br>
    water onto his face, then looks at his tired face in<br>
    the mirror...</p>
  <p> And stops, remembering something. He reaches to a<br>
    nearby panel and taps a button -- the TIME appears:<br>
    it's ten thirty-seven.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, realizing he's late for something. He<br>
    rushes to a nearby dressing area and starts to get<br>
    ready...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>4 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> GEORDI and DATA are working at a console; LIEUTENANT<br>
    SHIPLEY and VARIOUS ND'S also present. A console<br>
    monitor displays a MAP of the AMARGOSA DIASPORA.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: map)<br>
    Lieutenant Shipley -- let's get<br>
    a triangulation on these sector<br>
    points... (TECH)</p>
  <p> SHIPLEY<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Shipley works. Riker ENTERS, looking harried, like he<br>
    just woke up. He crosses to Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Sorry I'm late... I overslept<br>
    again...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What have you got?</p>
  <p> Geordi indicates the map.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The cluster's a lot more dense<br>
    than we thought. It's going<br>
    to take three days just to map<br>
    one tenth of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Three days?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we've found a way to speed<br>
    this up. We've been testing a<br>
    method of channeling warp energy<br>
    to the main deflector grid. It<br>
    enhances the long-range sensors...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The modification would increase<br>
    our sensor efficiency and imaging<br>
    resolution by twenty-five percent<br>
    or more.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sounds like that would take a<br>
    lot of warp energy...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd channel it through the EPS<br>
    mains on Deck Thirteen... near<br>
    Cargo Bay Four.</p>
  <p> Riker is convinced.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's worth a try.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, let's get those subspace<br>
    field taps on-line...</p>
  <p> Data stands to go... stops by Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Commander -- I would like to<br>
    remind you about my poetry reading<br>
    this afternoon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wouldn't miss it for the world.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Riker and Geordi exchange a look...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can hardly wait to see what he<br>
    came up with...</p>
  <p> As they work...</p>
  <p>5 INT. TEN FORWARD</p>
  <p> Later. Data is giving his poetry reading to a small<br>
    audience, including Riker, Geordi, PICARD, TROI, WORF<br>
    and KAMINER (A FEMALE CIVILIAN).</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/17/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data sits perched on a stool, reading from a PADD. His<br>
    voice is sonorous, measured, his timing utterly<br>
    perfect:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reading)<br>
    &quot;Then we sat on the sand for some time and<br>
    observed<br>
    How the oceans that cover this world were<br>
    perturbed<br>
    By the tides from the orbiting moon overhead<br>
    'How relaxing the sound of the waves is,' you<br>
    said.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    &quot;I began to expound upon tidal effects<br>
    When you told me to stop, looking somewhat<br>
    perplexed<br>
    So I did not explain why the sunset turned red<br>
    And we watched the occurrence in silence<br>
    instead.&quot;</p>
  <p> There is APPLAUSE from the audience. Data acknowledges<br>
    the crowd. Riker lets out a huge yawn. Troi throws<br>
    him a look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (softly, to Troi)<br>
    I don't understand this... I can<br>
    barely keep my eyes open...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to audience)<br>
    That poem was written in anapestic<br>
    tetrameter. For my ninth poem,<br>
    we move to the iambic septameter<br>
    mode.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Throughout the ages, from Keats<br>
    to Jorkemo, poets have composed<br>
    odes to the individuals who have<br>
    had a profound effect on their<br>
    lives. In keeping with that<br>
    tradition, I have written my next<br>
    poem in honor of my cat. I call<br>
    it &quot;Ode to Spot.&quot;</p>
  <p> Data looks at the page, takes in a breath...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - TEASER 4A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reading)<br>
    &quot;Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature<br>
    An endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature<br>
    Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses<br>
    Contribute to your hunting skill and natural<br>
    defenses.&quot;</p>
  <p> It is evident from the audience's responses that Data<br>
    has been reading for a long while -- too long. People<br>
    are starting to shift uncomfortably. Riker looks like<br>
    he might fall asleep at any moment. While Data's<br>
    poetry is technically flawless, it is also dry and<br>
    tedious, without passion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;I find myself intrigued by your sub-vocal<br>
    oscillations<br>
    A singular development of cat communication<br>
    That obviates your basic hedonistic predilection<br>
    For a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate<br>
    affection... &quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> People try to look enthused as Data reads... but it's<br>
    difficult. Many are fighting boredom. Geordi and Worf<br>
    exchange a look... Picard crosses and uncrosses his<br>
    legs... Riker is struggling to stay awake -- he can<br>
    barely keep his eyes focused... he shifts in his seat,<br>
    stifles a yawn...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    &quot;A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic<br>
    talents<br>
    You would not be so agile if you lacked its<br>
    counterbalance<br>
    And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion<br>
    It often serves to illustrate the state of your<br>
    emotions.&quot;</p>
  <p> Suddenly, from somewhere in the audience, a SNORE is<br>
    heard.</p>
  <p>6 ON RIKER</p>
  <p> who has fallen asleep. Troi nudges him. He wakes with<br>
    a start, disoriented, and automatically starts to<br>
    applaud. Data stops reading. People look over. Riker<br>
    realizes what's happened...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    You have prematurely anticipated<br>
    my denouement, Commander.<br>
    However, I appreciate the<br>
    sentiment.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will continue.</p>
  <p> Data continues to read.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Oh Spot, the complex level of behavior you display<br>
    Connotes a fairly well-developed cognitive array<br>
    And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not<br>
    comprehend<br>
    I nonetheless consider you a true and valued<br>
    friend... &quot;</p>
  <p> Over this, Troi throws a look at Riker, who is<br>
    disturbed by his overwhelming fatigue. OFF his face,<br>
    as he stifles another yawn, wondering how he could be<br>
    so exhausted...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)</p>
  <p>7 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Riker sitting on an examination table, looking<br>
    fatigued. Beverly scans him with a medical tricorder.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I don't have any problem getting<br>
    to sleep... and I think I'm<br>
    sleeping all night... but when<br>
    I wake up, I feel exhausted...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    How long has this been going on?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The last two, three nights...</p>
  <p> Riker eyes the tricorder, growing agitated as Beverly<br>
    waves it near his head.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: tricorder)<br>
    Do you have to hold that thing<br>
    so close?</p>
  <p> Beverly moves the tricorder away, surprised by the<br>
    remark. Riker relaxes a little.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sorry... I've been on edge<br>
    all day.</p>
  <p> Beverly completes her scan.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Other than some muscle tension<br>
    in your neck, I don't see anything<br>
    wrong with you physically...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Have you been having bad dreams?</p>
  <p> Riker thinks, rubs his sore neck.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not that I can remember...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Beverly considers.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    This may be the result of a lack<br>
    of REM sleep...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you recommend?</p>
  <p> Beverly picks up a PADD, taps something into it --<br>
    hands the PADD to Riker.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Drink this before you go to bed.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: PADD)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    A recipe for a warm milk toddy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (playful)<br>
    Warm milk toddy... you're kidding.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (right back at him)<br>
    The heat activates amino acids<br>
    in the lactose -- which acts as<br>
    a natural sedative.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Besides, this is a recipe of the<br>
    Captain's Aunt Adelle. It's<br>
    delicious.</p>
  <p> Riker stands to go.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At this point, I'll give anything<br>
    a try.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Thanks.</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles. Riker EXITS...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/17/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENGINEERING (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are working at a console; Lieutenant<br>
    Shipley and N.D.s also present. Geordi looks excited<br>
    by their work -- this is an important moment for him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Everything's in place... deflector<br>
    grid couplers... subspace field<br>
    taps...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Let's do it. Lieutenant Shipley<br>
    -- initiate warp power transfer...</p>
  <p> SHIPLEY<br>
    Aye sir...<br>
    (works)<br>
    Sensor array on-line...</p>
  <p> Geordi watches the console closely, eager for this to<br>
    work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Come on... work...</p>
  <p> Data monitors his console for a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Geordi -- active scanner output<br>
    has increased by twenty-six<br>
    percent.</p>
  <p> Geordi is pleased -- he turns to Shipley.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Shipley)<br>
    Inform Astrophysics that the new<br>
    La Forge sensor array is on-line<br>
    and awaiting major scientific<br>
    discoveries.</p>
  <p> SHIPLEY<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Shipley EXITS. Geordi moves to a console. A beat as<br>
    they work. Data turns to Geordi, curious.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi... may I make a personal<br>
    inquiry? It concerns my poetry<br>
    reading.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks uncomfortable at the mention of it...<br>
    keeps working...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Sure, Data... what is it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I noticed that many spectators<br>
    seemed distracted during my<br>
    presentation. Was my poetry<br>
    uninteresting?</p>
  <p> Geordi hesitates, awkward.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... it was very well<br>
    constructed... a real tribute<br>
    to form...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I especially liked your Haiku<br>
    poem...</p>
  <p> Data looks puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My Haiku was only three lines<br>
    long.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... it was great... very...<br>
    brisk...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Brisk...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Geordi, are you saying that the<br>
    shorter my poems, the better?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No... well... sort of...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    To be honest, Data... some of your<br>
    longer poems were a little dry.</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/17/92 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi comes clean.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe some of your poems were a<br>
    little... formal.</p>
  <p> Data considers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have found poetry more<br>
    challenging than other artistic<br>
    endeavors. Unlike painting and<br>
    musical composition, it demands<br>
    a more articulated emotional<br>
    content.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Next time, don't worry so much<br>
    about rhyme and meter. Some of the<br>
    world's greatests poets didn't pay<br>
    attention to rules...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a warning ALARM goes off. Geordi reacts,<br>
    looks toward the large wall DISPLAY of the Enterprise.<br>
    A section of the ship is FLASHING.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: alarm)<br>
    That's the power grid warning...</p>
  <p> They quickly move to the wall display, study it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off display)<br>
    I am reading a massive EPS<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Where?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am attempting to localize it...<br>
    (works)<br>
    It is Cargo Bay Four.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    I've got three people down there!<br>
    (taps communicator)<br>
    Damage control, medical team, to<br>
    Cargo Bay Four!<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Let's go...</p>
  <p> As Geordi and Data run out...</p>
  <p>9 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> ON THE MOVE with Worf and ONE SECURITY N.D. running<br>
    along, emergency gear in-tow. They converge outside<br>
    the CARGO BAY FOUR doors, where Geordi, Data and<br>
    Shipley are already taking tricorder scans. Beverly<br>
    and TWO MEDICAL N.D.s arrive a second later, with a<br>
    gurney and various medical gear.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (off tricorder)<br>
    The field imbalance has subsided.<br>
    I believe it is safe to enter.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - 8/14/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf motions for everyone to move aside.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to all)<br>
    There may still be a residual<br>
    discharge. Stand clear.</p>
  <p> Worf and the security N.D.'s position themselves on<br>
    either side of the door, emergency gear at-the-ready.<br>
    Once they're in place, Worf works the control panel on<br>
    the wall and the doors OPEN...</p>
  <p> A beat as nothing happens. Then Worf nods and the<br>
    security team quickly enters the bay...</p>
  <p>10 INT. CARGO BAY</p>
  <p> Continuous. Worf and the security N.D.'s rush in --<br>
    and stop at what they see. Geordi and the others<br>

  <p> The THREE CREWMEMBERS are carrying a piece of<br>

    unharmed. The Cargo Bay is undamaged. There has been<br>
    no explosion. Nothing is wrong.</p>
  <p> CREWMEMBER<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    Just a sensor glitch?</p>

    clearly exhausted.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe we should pick this up<br>

  <p> Riker dressed in his nightclothes, ready for bed,<br>
    standing at a replicator slot. Offscreen, we HEAR<br>
    a glass of warm milk MATERIALIZE. He picks up the<br>
    glass, takes a sip, winces at the taste.</p>
  <p> He crosses to the bed and sits down.... takes a long<br>
    drink of the milk... sets the glass on a nearby table.<br>
    He touches a panel on the table and the lights DIM.</p>

    Who is it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    Commander La Forge.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts, curious and a little annoyed. He throws<br>
    off the covers and stands, crosses the room and taps a<br>
    panel by the door. The door slides open to REVEAL<br>
    Geordi, who is surprised to see Riker still dressed in<br>
    his nightclothes.</p>

  <p> MOT the Barber is with a colleague. Worf ENTERS. Mot<br>
    turns, sees Worf and his face drops -- he's not pleased<br>
    to see the intimidating Klingon. Worf fixes him with a<br>
    baleful look, as Mot nervously tries to make Worf<br>
    welcome.</p>
  <p> MOT<br>
    Mister Worf! My good Klingon,<br>
    sir, welcome. It's a pleasure<br>
    to have you with us again... so...<br>

  <p> Worf walks to a barber chair, sits down. Mot picks<br>
    up a smock and starts to drape it around Worf...</p>
  <p> MOT<br>
    Haircut today, Lieutenant? Trim<br>
    your beard?</p>
  <p> Worf glares him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p> MOT<br>
    Ah. A trim, of course...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

    Not like last time.</p>
  <p> MOT<br>
    (quickly)<br>
    Oh no -- just a little off the<br>

    time...</p>
  <p> Mot starts to adjust Worf's chair, lowering it...</p>

    luxuriant Klingon hair is... it's<br>
    such a pleasure to cut, sometimes<br>
    I get carried away...</p>
  <p> As he talks, Mot takes hold of Worf's head and moves<br>
    it forward a bit. Worf reacts again, not liking the<br>
    feeling... Mot picks up a comb and a pair of<br>
    hair-cutting SCISSORS...</p>
  <p> MOT<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    All those Away Missions...<br>
    wind... dry air... the elements<br>
    are very harsh on the hair. I'd<br>
    like to suggest you start using<br>
    a conditioning agent...</p>
  <p> Mot moves the scissors toward Worf's head...</p>

  <p> as they move toward Worf. The light glints off the<br>
    shiny metal blades...</p>
  <p>18 WORF</p>
  <p> grabs Mot's wrist, as if in self-defense. For some<br>
    reason, the scissors have struck a primal chord in<br>
    Worf.</p>
  <p> Mot stops, startled. Worf stares intensely at the<br>
    scissors, trying to place his fear of them. Mot is<br>
    shaken, afraid Worf is going to kill him.</p>
  <p> MOT<br>
    I promise -- not too much off<br>
    the top!</p>
  <p> Worf glances at Mot... lets go of his wrist... throws<br>
    off the smock and stands. The feeling goes away just<br>
    as quickly as it came. At a loss, Worf EXITS.</p>
  <p> Mot looks faint. OFF his reaction...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: circuitry)<br>
    Just before the grid alarm<br>

    power through this junction...<br>
    somehow, it must've tripped the<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    And they showed it as an EPS<br>
    explosion...</p>
  <p> Geordi nods, steps away from the panel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The question is, why? I've made<br>
    modifications to the sensors<br>
    before... and nothing like this<br>
    ever happened.</p>
  <p> Riker considers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We can't waste time chasing down<br>
    sensor ghosts. Keep the array<br>
    off-line until you have a chance<br>
    to take a closer look.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods, and lets out a yawn.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (yawning)<br>
    Aye sir...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: his yawn)<br>
    I know the feeling... the past<br>
    few nights, it seems the second<br>
    my head hits the pillow, it's time<br>
    to get up again.</p>

    Are you alright, Geordi?</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a few uncertain steps around the room...<br>

  <p> Riker concentrates, trying to grasp the feelings...</p>

    It's hard to describe... it was<br>
    vague... like the way you recall<br>
    a dream...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I remember the sensation of being<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    I had a similar response... to<br>

  <p>39 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Troi, Geordi, Beverly, Worf.<br>
    Picard is pacing, restless -- he's unnerved by the<br>
    helplessness he feels at the situation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've set up a containment field<br>
    in Cargo Bay Four. But the<br>
    rupture just keeps expanding.<br>
    I'd say we've got another five<br>
    or six hours before it breaches<br>
    the hull.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we still beam the affected<br>
    sections into space?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No sir. The spatial rupture is<br>
    creating severe nucleonic<br>
    interference. It is impossible<br>
    to obtain a positive lock on the<br>
    bulkheads.</p>
  <p> They consider.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    Has your analysis suggested any<br>
    way to seal the rupture?</p>
  <p> Geordi thinks.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We think we could close the<br>
    rupture by neutralizing the<br>
    tetryon emissions with a coherent<br>
    graviton pulse. But we'd have<br>
    to do it at the source.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How do we find the source?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's a good question. The<br>
    emissions are coming from a<br>
    tertiary subspace domain. But<br>
    subspace has an infinite number<br>
    of domains...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's like a huge honeycomb with<br>
    an endless number of cells. We<br>
    need to isolate the exact cell<br>
    the emissions are coming from...</p>

  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    If someone homed in on subspace<br>
    signals created by our modified<br>
    sensor array... can we do the same<br>
    thing to them -- track the tetryon<br>
    emissions to their universe?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Tetryon particles have a random<br>
    momentum. Our sensors are unable<br>
    to track them.</p>
  <p> They think for a moment. Worf gets an idea...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Perhaps we could make a homing<br>
    device -- something our sensors<br>
    could track.</p>
  <p> Geordi takes a beat, considers.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea. But there's no way<br>
    to get that device to the source.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, there is.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Give it to me.</p>
  <p> They look at him.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's pretty clear I've been taken<br>
    each of the past few nights...<br>
    if I'm right, there's every chance<br>
    it'll happen again tonight.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (onto the idea)<br>
    If you had a homing device, we<br>
    could track it to your location<br>
    in subspace... then, as soon as<br>
    they send you back to the ship...<br>
    we could transmit the graviton<br>
    pulse and neutralize the tetryon<br>
    emissions...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    If they send him back. Ensign<br>
    Rager still hasn't been<br>
    returned...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    They're going to take me whether<br>
    I want to go or not.</p>
  <p> A beat as Picard considers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    We'll wait as long as we can for<br>
    you to be returned, Number One.<br>
    But as soon the spatial rupture<br>
    threatens the ship... we'll have<br>
    to transmit that graviton pulse.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> A grim beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Perhaps we can give you an<br>
    advantage... a way of keeping you<br>
    conscious after they take you...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Doctor -- can you develop a<br>
    counter-agent to the<br>
    neuro-sedative they've been giving<br>
    the crew?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I could try a neuro-stimulant<br>
    -- but the dosage would have to<br>
    be pretty high to counter the<br>
    effects. It might be risky.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a risk I'm willing to take.</p>

  <p> Geordi, Beverly, Riker. Geordi is making a few<br>
    adjustments to a tricorder. Beverly injects Riker with<br>
    a hypospray. Riker shakes his head, feeling<br>
    lightheaded.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It should be enough to ward off<br>
    their neuro-sedative for about<br>
    twelve hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I hope that's enough.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It'll have to be. I can't risk<br>
    giving you a higher dosage.</p>
  <p> Geordi completes his adjustments, hands Riker the<br>
    tricorder.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/18/92 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>39A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've locked the tricorder into<br>
    continuous scan. That way, it'll<br>
    keep recording whether you open<br>
    it or not.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Maybe you can bring back some<br>
    information about their universe.</p>
  <p> Riker takes the tricorder. Geordi picks up an armband<br>
    DEVICE (as seen in &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;) and shows it<br>
    to Riker. Geordi presses a button on the device and<br>
    a LIGHT comes on.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Later. Riker alone, on his back, lying in bed, eyes<br>
    open, unable to sleep. He's in uniform, a phaser<br>
    attached to his waist and a tricorder in his hand. The<br>
    homing device armband is strapped to his left arm.<br>
    (Note: the tricorder is active). A quiet moment passes<br>
    by as he lies there, waiting...</p>

  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>42 INT. ALIEN LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON RIKER, who carefully opens his eyes,<br>
    disoriented -- where is he? He steals a look at the<br>
    strange surroundings, testing the situation... all the<br>
    while, trying to appear as though he is<br>
    semi-conscious...</p>
  <p> The room resembles the Holodeck lab from Act Three -- a<br>
    pool of light shining down on a smooth operating table,<br>
    darkness all around -- except it is more detailed,<br>
    embellished with various alien gadgets and markings.<br>
    It has a DISTORTED quality -- surreal and dream-like,<br>
    as though our perceptions are being altered. SOUNDS<br>
    echo back and forth, disorienting. The CLICKING NOISES<br>
    can be heard -- suggestive of the Holodeck recreation,<br>
    but more strange and alien-sounding. We are in another<br>
    space -- tetryon space.</p>
  <p> We see the examination table, which resembles the<br>
    Holodeck table, but is embellished with various alien<br>
    markings and appliances. Riker is trapped beneath an<br>
    alien CONSOLE on top of his arms and chest, holding him<br>
    down. Attached to the swing-arm on the table is the<br>
    familiar TOOL -- its jagged blades all the more vivid<br>
    and terrifying in real life.</p>
  <p> Riker looks beside him. Ensign Rager is lying on a<br>
    nearby platform on the floor. Her eyes are open, but<br>
    her expression is blank. Clearly, she's been heavily<br>
    sedated and is semi-conscious. Riker sees it's<br>
    hopeless and looks elsewhere, into the surrounding<br>
    darkness...</p>
  <p> Barely visible in the darkness, several shadowy FIGURES<br>
    are rustling about, making the clicking sounds. An<br>
    alien-looking CONSOLE is visible as well as an empty<br>
    PLATFORM. One of the figures approaches Riker. It is<br>
    clearly ALIEN. A dark, contorted body... jerky<br>
    movements... strange chattering, clicking noises...<br>
    always obscured by shadow, so we never get a clear view<br>
    of it, only terrifying glimpses...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/20/92 - ACT FIVE 44.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker continues to feign semi-consciousness. The<br>
    clicking sounds intensify, and a bright light SHINES<br>
    into Riker's face. Riker watches as a small PEDESTAL<br>
    is moved next to the table, near his left hand. On top<br>
    of the pedestal there are several bizarre and<br>
    frightening ALIEN TOOLS.</p>
  <p> An ALIEN HAND reaches into the light and removes the<br>
    phaser from Riker's waist, then takes the tricorder out<br>
    of his hand. (Note: Although closed, the tricorder<br>
    stays activated throughout the scene.) The alien then<br>
    removes the homing device from Riker's arm... and sets<br>
    all three instruments on the pedestal.</p>
  <p> The alien moves back into the darkness. Riker steals<br>
    a look to make sure the alien has left... glances at<br>
    the alien tools on the pedestal, worried. OFF his face<br>
    as he furtively watches...</p>

    Ready, Commander.</p>
  <p> Geordi hits a couple of controls, then moves to a<br>

    button...</p>

  <p> The rupture is still looking out into the Enterprise<br>
    Cargo Bay, like a window. Suddenly, the room SHAKES.<br>
    The rupture shudders, starts to get smaller -- closing<br>
    down. The alien figures react, unhappy with the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> Riker reacts too -- he sees his window of opportunity<br>
    starting to close down...</p>

    The rupture is beginning to close.</p>
  <p> Picard and Geordi exchange an excited look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Shipley)<br>
    Recharge the emitters! Let's hit<br>
    them again!</p>
  <p> Shipley works, recharging the emitters. A long beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (impatient)<br>
    Come on...</p>
  <p> SHIPLEY<br>
    Ready.</p>
  <p> Geordi hits a button on the wall panel again...</p>
  <p>52 INT. ALIEN LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The room SHAKES again. Riker decides to take the<br>
    opportunity while the Aliens are distracted. Slowly,<br>
    he steps off the table... pauses... glances at the<br>
    aliens...</p>
  <p> He steadies himself, keeping his balance in this<br>
    distorted environment isn't easy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/20/92 - ACT FIVE 50A.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He makes a quiet move toward the smaller table...<br>
    gingerly picks up his phaser... then his tricorder,<br>
    which is still blinking, active.</p>
  <p> The clicking noises intensify. Riker turns and sees<br>
    that two of the aliens are aware of his movements, and<br>
    are rushing toward him. Riker aims his phaser and<br>
    FIRES at the aliens, BLASTING them back into the<br>
    shadows. (NOTE: The phaser blasts should have an<br>
    unusual look in this universe). The clicking sounds<br>
    become panicky SCREECHES.</p>
  <p> Riker quickly moves to Rager, kneels down to pick her<br>
    up, but stops at what he sees -- several TUBES are<br>
    connected to Rager's neck, like alien IV's -- the<br>
    tubes are attached to a small alien INSTRUMENT that is<br>
    next to the platform.</p>
  <p> A beat as Riker decides what to do. In the background,<br>
    an alien figure is approaching Riker...</p>

  <p>52B INT. ALIEN LAB (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As before. The room SHAKES violently. Finally, Riker<br>
    picks up Rager and the alien instrument -- gathers them<br>
    over his shoulder and, with great effort, starts to<br>
    carry them across the room, in the direction of the<br>
    spatial rupture...</p>
  <p> The alien figures are converging on Riker, who FIRES<br>
    several phaser BLASTS in their direction.</p>

  <p>52B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Screeching, the alien figures scatter out of the way.<br>

  <p> As the rupture starts to close down, an ALIEN SHAPE<br>
    EMERGES -- a huge COIL OF ENERGY which snakes out of<br>
    the rupture -- quick and violent -- then across the<br>
    Cargo Bay and through the wall out into space...</p>

  <p> The spatial rupture is gone. Silence. Riker and Data<br>
    exchange a look. What the hell was that? As they<br>

    Captain's Log, Stardate 46119.2.<br>
    The tetryon emissions in Cargo<br>
    Bay Four have ceased, and there<br>
    have been no further indications<br>
    of alien intrusions. All<br>
    Enterprise crewmembers are safe<br>
    and accounted for. But we are<br>
    still left with some unanswered<br>
    questions...</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/18/92 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Based on the information gathered<br>
    by Commander Riker's tricorder,<br>
    we have determined that the<br>
    molecular structure of the alien<br>
    life forms is solanogen-based.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We think that's why they couldn't<br>
    come through into our space, as<br>
    easily as they could take us into<br>
    theirs...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They needed to learn how to<br>
    remodulate their cellular energy<br>
    states in order to survive in our<br>
    universe.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The tricorder readings indicate<br>
    they created a small pocket of<br>
    our universe in their lab to<br>
    keep those who were abducted<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Like putting a fish in a bucket<br>
    of water...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They were probably trying to do<br>
    the same thing in Cargo Bay Four<br>
    -- create a pocket of their<br>
    universe in ours.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What can we do to prevent this<br>
    from happening again?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It looks like they found us<br>
    initially by discovering my<br>
    modified sensor signal. We should<br>
    warn all Starfleet ships not<br>
    to make the same mistake.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat as they contemplate.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Schisms&quot; - REV. 8/18/92 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>61 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Data, Geordi)<br>
    Have you any idea what came<br>
    through the rupture, before you<br>
    were able to shut it down?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No sir. We were unable to track<br>
    it once it left the Cargo Bay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe it was a probe of some<br>
    kind...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps they are simply curious.<br>
    Explorers, like ourselves.</p>
  <p> Riker is grim-faced.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Ensign Rager and I were lucky to<br>
    escape... and Lieutenant<br>
    Hagler's dead...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have a feeling that whoever<br>
    sent that thing... was more<br>
    than simply curious.</p>
  <p> As they consider the foreboding prospects that lie<br>
    ahead...</p>
