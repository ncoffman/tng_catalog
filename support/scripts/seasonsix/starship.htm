    TEASER <br>
  </p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> docked at a GIANT ARRAY of some kind in orbit above a<br>
    planet. The ship is sandwiched between two banks of<br>
    reflector dishes.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 46682.4.<br>
    The Enterprise is docked at the<br>
    Remmler Array, where it will<br>
    undergo a routine procedure to<br>
    eliminate accumulated baryon<br>
    particles. In preparation for the<br>
    sweep, we are evacuating the ship.</p>
  <p>2 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> We see the commotion of evacuation, N.D.s crisscrossing<br>
    in the corridor. PICARD, rounds the corner, a<br>
    purposefulness in his stride. He soon encounters TROI,<br>
    PADD in hand, waiting to speak with him. They talk on<br>
    the move.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... we're still behind<br>
    schedule on decks seven and eight.<br>
    Shall I tell Arkaria Base there'll<br>
    be a delay?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No. Open up the Transporters in<br>
    Cargo Bay Two and divert everyone<br>
    from deck seven there. That<br>
    should get us back on track.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> Picard nods and moves on.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - REV. - 01/15/93 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> He now passes by BEVERLY, who falls into step with him<br>
    and we STAY with them, on the move.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain... Arkaria Base does not<br>
    have the medical storage units I<br>
    requested. I have seven living<br>
    tissue samples that won't survive<br>
    the baryon sweep anymore than you<br>
    or I would. I've tried to reason<br>
    with them, but --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Have Mister LaForge transport a<br>
    stasis unit from the astrophysics<br>
    lab. You should be able to<br>
    convert it to store tissue<br>
    samples.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> She smiles, turns, heads back to Sickbay. Picard<br>
    continues on.</p>
  <p>3 TURBOLIFT ENTRANCE</p>
  <p> The doors whoosh open and RIKER steps off... just in<br>
    time to intercept the approaching Picard. Behind<br>
    Riker, the Turbolift doors close.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... I was just heading for<br>
    deck seven. I've put the auto-shutdown<br>
    sequence on hold until we<br>
    get back on schedule.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think we can resume the<br>
    sequence. Counselor Troi is<br>
    taking care of the situation on<br>
    deck seven.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> The two head in opposite directions. The Turbolift<br>
    doors again whisk open as Picard approaches.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> We see DATA inside.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data.<br>
    (as he faces front)<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> The doors close and the Turbolift's in motion. A<br>
    silent beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It has been quite a day, has it<br>
    not?</p>
  <p> Picard's one-tracked, no time for chit-chat... but at<br>
    the same time he's a bit surprised at Data's<br>
    uncharacteristic approach.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes it has.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, a change of routine is<br>
    often invigorating and can be a<br>
    welcome diversion after a long<br>
    assignment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (more of the same)<br>
    Exactly.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I understand that Arkaria has some<br>
    very interesting weather patterns.</p>
  <p> Picard gives Data a look...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Data -- are you alright?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I was attempting to<br>
    fill a silent moment with non-relevant<br>
    conversation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (thinks)<br>
    Small talk?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I have found that<br>
    humans often make &quot;small talk&quot;<br>
    during awkward moments.<br>
    Therefore, I have written a new<br>
    subroutine designed for that<br>
    purpose. How did I do?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps it was a little too... non-relevant.<br>
    However, if you're<br>
    interested in small talk keep your<br>
    eye on Commander Hutchinson during<br>
    the reception this afternoon...<br>
    (not looking forward to<br>
    it)<br>
    ... he's a master.</p>
  <p> The Turbolift STOPS and they both EXIT onto the Bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you sir, I will.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Data ENTER to find the last leg of a<br>
    frenetic race: Bridge regulars and a handful of N.D.s<br>
    shutting down consoles. Picard is set upon<br>
    simultaneously by Geordi and Worf.</p>
  <p> GEORDI WORF<br>
    I just finished... Request permission...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    After you...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    No sir. I believe you spoke<br>
    first.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We're running out of time,<br>
    gentlemen. Mister Worf?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The computer needs your<br>
    authorization to disable command<br>
    functions during the baryon sweep.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are we ready, Mister La Forge?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Almost. I've requested some<br>
    additional field diverters for the<br>
    computer core and the Bridge and<br>
    they haven't been installed yet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (concerned)<br>
    Additional units?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've logged more warp hours in<br>
    five years than most ships do in<br>
    ten, so our baryon particle levels<br>
    are pretty high. I'm a little<br>
    worried that when the Remmler<br>
    Array starts sweeping the ship it<br>
    might have to use a stronger beam<br>
    than normal to clear out all the<br>
    radiation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    And that might overload the field<br>
    diverters protecting our key<br>
    systems. How long until the new<br>
    ones are in place?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'd say another twenty minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well.<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Computer, disable all command<br>
    functions in thirty minutes.<br>
    Authorization: Picard gamma-six-zero-seven-three.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Authorization acknowledged.</p>
  <p> Worf's console BEEPS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off console)<br>
    Incoming message, Captain. It's<br>
    the station administrator, Mister<br>
    Orton.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In my Ready Room.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir. Request permission to be<br>
    excused from Commander<br>
    Hutchinson's... reception.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Permission granted. I only wish<br>
    I could excuse myself as well.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, permission to --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sorry, Mister LaForge... I can't<br>
    excuse the entire senior staff.<br>
    Worf beat you to it.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS to the Ready Room. Worf looks pleased and<br>
    Geordi gives him a dirty look.</p>
  <p>6 INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUING</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS, goes behind his desk, and activates the<br>
    terminal.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead, Mister Orton.</p>
  <p> He gets out his satchel and, under the following, loads<br>
    it with odds and ends.</p>
  <p> ORTON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain, if you're on schedule,<br>
    I'd like to confirm that we'll<br>
    begin the baryon sweep at fifteen<br>
    hundred hours -- approximately one<br>
    hour from now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Confirmed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 6A.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ORTON'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander Hutchinson also wanted<br>
    me to make sure that you'll be<br>
    able to attend his reception this<br>
    afternoon.</p>
  <p> Picard's expression tells us that he's not exactly<br>
    thrilled about this particular event.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tell him... I'm looking forward to<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> ORTON'S COM VOICE<br>
    He'll be delighted to hear that.<br>
    Arkaria Base out.</p>
  <p> Picard closes his satchel. Time to go.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS to find it... empty. It takes him a<br>
    moment to adjust. He walks around, drinks in the<br>
    solitude, savors it. Finally, he sits in his chair.<br>
    A long, quiet beat...</p>
  <p>8 NEW ANGLE - INCLUDE TURBOLIFTS</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the fore and aft Turbolifts OPEN and SIX<br>
    TECHNICIANS ENTER the Bridge: four humanoids --<br>
    KELSEY, NEIL, POMET and DEVOR and two aliens -- SATLER,<br>
    and KIROS. (Full descriptions to follow later in the<br>
    script). They are all wearing plain-looking overalls<br>
    and two of them are carrying FIELD DIVERTERS -- about<br>
    the size and shape of a trash can -- while the others<br>
    carry Tricorders and other pieces of equipment.</p>
  <p> As soon as the doors open, they fill the Bridge with<br>
    noise and chatter, effectively destroying Picard's<br>
    brief moment of solitude.</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Tell Arkaria base that we're<br>
    almost finished here...</p>
  <p> NEIL<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    We're going to need two more<br>
    conduits...</p>
  <p> KIROS<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    I need to run a diagnostic on the<br>
    diverter...</p>
  <p> DEVOR<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Get the diverter aligned so that<br>
    we can begin the isolation<br>
    procedure.</p>
  <p> NEIL<br>
    (overlapping)<br>
    Where's the ODN interface?</p>
  <p> Picard heads for the Turbolift over the above and the<br>
    technicians take no notice of him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>9 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He stops and gives one last look around. So much for<br>
    peace and quiet. And as he ENTERS the Turbolift...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes) </p>
  <p>10 EXT. ARKARIA BASE - DAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A lone outpost in the middle of nowhere...</p>
  <p>11 INT. ARKARIA BASE - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM</p>
  <p> A festive reception is underway. There's a CONTROL<br>
    PANEL at one end, but the room otherwise has a party<br>
    feel to it. There are tables of food. A WAITER<br>
    circulates with drinks. ORTON can be seen in the b.g.</p>
  <p>12 ANGLE - HUTCHINSON</p>
  <p> As he works the room. Hutchinson is a middle-aged,<br>
    jovial man who lives for gatherings like this and loves<br>
    nothing more than to entertain a starship crew. Data<br>
    is quietly observing Hutchinson's technique and he<br>
    unobtrusively follows the gregarious Commander about<br>
    the room, watching and learning.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Beverly!<br>
    (kiss on the cheek)<br>
    Lovely as ever... how do you<br>
    manage it?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's good to see you again.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    It's been far too long -- what is<br>
    it, four years? Now I want to<br>
    hear all about what happened after<br>
    you left Starfleet Medical. And<br>
    I have so much to tell you.<br>
    (sees someone else)<br>
    Oh, that must be Commander Riker.<br>
    Excuse me, won't you?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> Beverly is quietly grateful that he's moved on and she<br>
    takes a drink off a tray in relief.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    You must be Wil Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I guess I must.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Calvin Hutchinson -- call me<br>
    Hutch. Calvin -- awful name, I've<br>
    never forgiven my parents. As<br>
    soon as I saw you, I knew you had<br>
    to be the Enterprise's first<br>
    officer.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Of course. Your reputation<br>
    proceeds you -- flashing blue<br>
    eyes, square jaw... quite the<br>
    ladies man I hear. Now don't be<br>
    modest, Wil -- may I call you Wil?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Uh, sure.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    I've also heard that you're a<br>
    musician. I hope you'll play<br>
    something for us. It's not often<br>
    that I get a chance to entertain<br>
    the command crew of the<br>
    flagship... and speaking of<br>
    command, hello Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Riker takes this opportunity to slip quietly away and<br>
    leave Picard. Picard's face has that frozen smile of<br>
    forced cheerfulness on it as Hutchinson natters on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    I was just telling your first<br>
    officer what a real pleasure it is<br>
    to have you all...</p>
  <p>13 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Riker moves over to stand with Beverly. Riker gives<br>
    her a look and she smiles in commiseration.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data (who has been observing Hutchinson) approaches the<br>
    two of them. He tries to talk quickly and easily --<br>
    patterning his behavior after Hutchinson.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is very good to see you both<br>
    again. May I call you Beverly? --<br>
    Beverly, do you find the mean<br>
    temperature here on Arkaria to be<br>
    slightly above normal for human<br>
    comfort levels?</p>
  <p> Riker and Beverly exchange a look... they can't believe<br>
    this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have found that most humans<br>
    prefer a temperature of twenty-one<br>
    degrees C in order to operate most<br>
    efficiently. However, there are<br>
    some cultures which actually...</p>
  <p>14 PICARD AND HUTCHINSON</p>
  <p> Hutchinson is going on as Picard looks for a way out.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    ... I tell you, you've never seen<br>
    anything like it. There were<br>
    thousands of these creatures...<br>
    the whole northern sky turned<br>
    dark.</p>
  <p> Picard suddenly sees a way out as Geordi and Troi walk<br>
    by.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi! Deanna! I don't believe<br>
    you've met our host.<br>
    (to Hutchinson)<br>
    Allow me to introduce Commander<br>
    Geordi La Forge, Counselor Deanna<br>
    Troi. This is Commander<br>
    Hutchinson.</p>

  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>

    about some of the fascinating<br>
    sights here on Arkaria. Is either<br>
    of you interested in ornithology?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Uh... well...</p>
  <p> Picard is starting to make his getaway.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    The mating habits of the Arkarian<br>
    horn fowl are quite interesting.<br>
    If the weather were better, we<br>
    could take horses to the southern<br>
    promontory and visit the nesting<br>
    grounds.</p>
  <p> Picard stops, turns.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Horses?</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Yes... there's a network of trails<br>
    through the plains.<br>
    Unfortunately, they aren't very<br>
    pleasant right now... muddy, cold.<br>
    Not a soul for kilometers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That sounds... perfect.<br>
    (beat, then to Geordi)<br>
    How long until the baryon sweep<br>
    begins on the Enterprise?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At least twenty-five minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then I'll have time to get my<br>
    saddle.</p>
  <p> This is met with blank stares from the other three.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Your... saddle?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (notices their looks)<br>
    A saddle is a very personal thing.<br>
    It has to be broken in... worn...<br>
    cared for...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You keep a saddle... on the<br>
    Enterprise?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've had it since the Academy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I never know when I'll have the<br>
    opportunity to ride.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's perfectly normal. Most<br>
    serious riders have their own<br>
    saddles.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Absolutely.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If you'll excuse me.</p>
  <p> They smile as Picard EXITS. But the mirth on Troi and<br>
    Geordi's faces vanishes as they soon realize that they<br>
    still have Hutchinson to deal with and that they have<br>
    no smooth way out.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    (re: Picard)<br>
    An amazing man. He reminds me of<br>
    another officer I knew many years<br>
    ago... a Captain Edwell. Now he<br>
    was fascinating... born on Gaspra<br>
    Seven but you wouldn't know it<br>
    from the way he looked...</p>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>15 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The door to Picard's quarters opens and Picard ENTERS<br>
    the corridor, his saddle slung over his shoulder. He<br>
    has now changed into civilian clothes -- casual work<br>
    clothes with a jacket.</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Auto-shutdown sequence in<br>
    progress. Defensive systems off-line.<br>
    Baryon sweep begins in<br>
    eight minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard walks just a little faster. Then he rounds a<br>
    bend and sees something. He slows, looking concerned.</p>
  <p>16 PICARD'S POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A wall panel just above floor level has been removed,<br>
    some fiber-optic cables yanked out. Picard approaches,<br>
    sets his saddle down and kneels to inspect the open<br>
    panel. Suddenly --</p>
  <p> DEVOR'S VOICE<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> Picard looks up to see Devor, one of the technical<br>
    crew, standing over him, a pistol-size laser-welder in<br>
    his hand. Picard rises, wary.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Somone left this ODN junction box<br>
    open.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I thought your crew was supposed<br>
    to leave the ship once the field<br>
    diverters were in place.</p>
  <p> DEVOR<br>
    The diverters have to be<br>
    synchronized.<br>
    (re: laser)<br>
    I was laser-bonding a backup link.</p>
  <p> Picard regards him evenly.</p>

  <p>16 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see. Well, I suppose I'd better<br>
    let you finish up so you can get<br>
    off the ship.</p>
  <p> Picard scoops up his saddle, moves off, his back to<br>
    Devor. The alien realizes Picard suspects something.</p>
  <p> DEVOR<br>
    Wait a minute --</p>
  <p> As Picard turns, Devor raises the laser-welder, but<br>
    Picard has anticipated him. He slams Devor with the<br>
    saddle, sending him back hard into the wall. The<br>
    welder DISCHARGES into the air.</p>
  <p> Devor springs back into a combat stance... but Picard<br>
    is ready for him. He dodges, yanks him around in a<br>
    hammer lock and wedges the side of his hand into<br>
    Devor's carotid. Devor struggles for a second, then<br>
    slumps.</p>

  <p> Then the lights go out. Backup lighting kicks in --<br>
    slightly dimmer than what we're used to (and we'll see<br>
    this all over the ship from now on).</p>
  <p> Picard takes off -- fast, without his saddle -- and<br>
    heads for Transporter Room One.</p>

  <p> ACT TWO </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>25 INT. ARKARIA BASE</p>
  <p> The reception continues. Data's chatting up a non-appreciative<br>
    Orton. Orton is a native Arkarian and is<br>
    the Chief Administrator for the base. He carries<br>
    himself like an upper-class butler in the face of<br>
    Data's stream of small talk (he's probably had practice<br>
    at this with Hutchinson).</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I find it fascinating that your<br>
    family chose to drop the prefix<br>
    &quot;Pel&quot; from your surname. It was<br>
    my understanding that &quot;Pel Orton&quot;<br>
    would be considered a more noble<br>
    appellation on Arkaria than simply<br>
    Orton.</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Data is undeterred by this less than encouraging<br>
    response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps the recent Arkarian trend<br>
    toward a more egalitarian society<br>
    is partly responsible.</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    Perhaps.</p>
  <p>26 RIKER AND HUTCHINSON</p>
  <p> Riker has been waylaid by Hutchinson.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    The crew of the Magellan actually<br>
    put on a talent show here.<br>
    Captain Conklin did a poetry<br>
    reading, if you can imagine that.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm trying to.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Did I ever tell you how I came to<br>
    be stationed here? It's a<br>
    fascinating story.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker desperately wants a way out of here and suddenly<br>
    he thinks of one.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    You see, I was serving on Admiral<br>
    Mitchell's staff on Starbase<br>
    ninety-seven -- awful place, by<br>
    the way --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hutch. Have you met our Commander<br>
    Data?</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Why no, I don't think so.</p>
  <p> Riker takes him by the arm and steers him toward Data<br>
    and Orton. By the look on Orton's face, even his stiff<br>
    upper lip is beginning to crack under Data's onslaught.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Orton)<br>
    ... there are several cultures in<br>
    this sector with remarkably<br>
    similar etymological histories --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, allow me to introduce our<br>
    host. This is Commander<br>
    Hutchinson -- call him Hutch.<br>
    (to Hutchinson)<br>
    This is our second officer,<br>
    Commander Data.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    A pleasure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Hutchinson)<br>
    The pleasure is mine. I have been<br>
    meaning to compliment you on your<br>
    choice of colors here.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    You really think so? It wasn't<br>
    easy to make the final decision,<br>
    let me tell you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am sure of that. The light in<br>
    this room makes color selection<br>
    exceptionally problematic.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Precisely.</p>
  <p> Riker and Orton make a quiet getaway.</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're welcome.<br>
    (glancing back)<br>
    I'm not sure which one to feel<br>
    sorry for.</p>
  <p> An Arkarian Waiter catches Orton's attention.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    Mister Orton?</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    If you'll excuse me, Commander.</p>
  <p> Orton goes to talk with the Waiter. Riker moves to<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi... what happened to the<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He went back to the ship to get<br>
    his saddle.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    His saddle?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (like it's obvious)<br>
    Any serious rider would have his<br>
    own saddle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Oh.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He probably went right to the<br>
    stables. I bet he's ten<br>
    kilometers from here already.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (glances at Hutchinson<br>
    &amp; Data)<br>
    Lucky him.</p>

  <p>27 EXT. SPACE - REMMLER ARRAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The green swath is now partway through the nacelles.</p>
  <p>28 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> On feet dragging. WIDEN to see Picard pulling Devor<br>
    toward Sickbay.</p>
  <p> The laser torch is now stuck in Picard's pants. Picard<br>
    sets Devor down, and takes out a small suction device<br>
    from a pocket: an emergency manual door-opener. He<br>
    uses it to open the Sickbay door.</p>
  <p>29 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard drags Devor inside and sets him down. He goes<br>
    to a supply cabinet and gets out a hypospray and a<br>
    phaser... suddenly he HEARS STATIC...</p>
  <p>30 ON DEVOR</p>
  <p> The communicator strapped to his upper arm crackles to<br>
    life...</p>
  <p> KELSEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Kelsey to Devor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Devor, this is Kelsey. Reply.</p>
  <p> Picard moves close to Devor and removes his<br>
    communicator.</p>
  <p> KELSEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Devor, do you read me?<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Kelsey to Kiros.</p>
  <p> KIROS'S COM VOICE<br>
    This is Kiros.</p>
  <p> KELSEY'S COM VOICE<br>
    Devor isn't responding. There<br>
    must be too much interference from<br>
    the baryon sweep. Go find him and<br>
    see if he finished by-passing the<br>
    regulator on deck seven, then meet<br>
    us in Main Engineering.</p>
  <p> KIROS'S COM VOICE<br>
    Understood.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>30 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard is taking this all in. Devor groans. Picard<br>
    goes over to Devor, kneels next to him, and points the<br>
    phaser at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Who are you? What are you doing<br>
    on my ship.</p>
  <p> Devor looks at the phaser and sneers.</p>
  <p> DEVOR<br>
    The baryon sweep uses a high-frequency<br>
    plasma field. That<br>
    phaser won't work.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (unfazed)<br>
    You're probably right.</p>
  <p> Picard calmly pulls the laser-torch and points it to<br>
    Devor's head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But I'm willing to bet that this<br>
    will.</p>
  <p> Devor swallows hard, but stiffens his resolve.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What's going on in Main<br>
    Engineering?</p>
  <p> Devor says nothing and Picard presses the laser-torch<br>
    harder against his head.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I suggest you cooperate.</p>
  <p> Devor thinks for a moment, then his eyes narrow.</p>
  <p> DEVOR<br>
    You're Starfleet... you won't kill<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you sure?</p>
  <p> They look at each other for a moment, then Picard<br>
    tightens his grip on the torch... suddenly Devor's eyes<br>
    go wide and then he slumps back unconscious.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 23.</p>
  <p>31 WIDEN</p>
  <p> Revealing that Picard has just hyposprayed Devor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Devor)<br>
    I guess you're right.</p>
  <p> He puts Devor's communicator and laser-torch in his<br>
    pockets and then EXITS.</p>
  <p>32 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard is cautiously moving through the Corridor,<br>
    trying to be quiet and avoid running into anyone.</p>
  <p>33 ANOTHER CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Picard moves into an alcove where there is a Turbolift<br>
    entrance. He looks around and then pulls out his door-opening<br>
    device. He opens the door to the Turbolift,<br>
    then puts the device back in his pocket.</p>
  <p>34 INT. TURBOLIFT - CLOSE ON PICARD</p>
  <p> He reaches up to the ceiling and starts to open the<br>
    hatch... suddenly a WEAPON is put to the back of his<br>
    head.</p>

  <p> Revealing Kiros standing in the Corridor holding the<br>
    weapon to Picard's head.</p>
  <p>36 INT. ARKARIA BASE</p>
  <p> The ongoing reception. Hutchinson and Data are still<br>
    at it -- they feed off each other, and the feeling here<br>
    is almost that of one-upsmanship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    ... yes, but Tyrellian laser-art<br>
    is very similar in form and<br>
    composition.</p>

  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Oh, of course. Funny you should<br>
    mention that. I used to be<br>
    stationed on Tyrellia.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Really? There are five Tyrellians<br>
    currently serving aboard the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> HUTCHINSON<br>
    Fascinating. Not many people know<br>
    this, but Tyrellia is one of only<br>
    three known inhabited worlds<br>
    without a magnetic pole.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I was aware of that. Are you<br>
    aware that Tyrellia is also one of<br>
    seven known planets...</p>
  <p>37 NEW ANGLE - RIKER</p>
  <p> who is watching Data and Hutchinson from across the<br>
    room. Troi moves to him and follows his gaze.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Are they still at it?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Non-stop. I have to admit it has<br>
    a sort of strange fascination...<br>
    I mean, how long can two people<br>
    talk about... nothing?</p>
  <p> They continue to watch.</p>
  <p>38 ON GEORDI</p>
  <p> who is piling some food onto a plate from one of the<br>
    tables. The Waiter seen earlier is standing nearby.<br>
    Geordi suddenly frowns and looks down at the table in<br>
    puzzlement. He puts his hand on the table, feeling it<br>
    for heat. The Waiter immediately moves next to him.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 25.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh... I don't know. I'm getting<br>
    a weird energy reading from your<br>
    table.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    I'm sure it's nothing serious.<br>
    Perhaps the heating element under<br>
    the tray is malfunctioning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe I should take a look at it.</p>
  <p> As Geordi starts to bend down, Orton is suddenly there<br>
    and tries to get him away.</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    I'm sure we can handle this,<br>
    whatever it is, Commander.<br>
    There's no need to concern<br>
    yourself.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I really think I should look at<br>
    that heating element. If it<br>
    overloads under --</p>
  <p> Orton takes him by the arm -- a gentle but firm<br>
    gesture.</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    (firmer)<br>
    It's all right.</p>
  <p>39 RIKER AND TROI</p>
  <p> The conversation between Geordi and Orton has gotten<br>
    Riker's attention. He frowns.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's that all about?</p>
  <p> He starts moving toward Geordi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT TWO 26.</p>
  <p>40 ORTON AND GEORDI</p>
  <p> ORTON<br>
    We'll look into it. You don't<br>
    have to concern yourself.</p>
  <p> Over the above dialog, the Waiter suddenly sees Riker<br>
    walking towards them with a concerned look on his face.<br>
    He looks from Riker to Orton for a moment, then makes<br>
    a snap decision.</p>
  <p> WAITER<br>
    Orton, now!</p>
  <p> The following happens very quickly:</p>
  <p>41 THE WAITER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reaches under the food cart and yanks out an ALIEN<br>
    PHASER from the hidden compartment. He FIRES at Riker,<br>
    narrowly missing him. Riker dives for cover.</p>
  <p>42 ORTON</p>
  <p> shoves Geordi out of the way and grabs his own weapon.</p>
  <p>43 HUTCHINSON AND DATA</p>
  <p> react to the attack.</p>
  <p>44 GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> recovers and goes for Orton, but the Waiter FIRES a<br>
    burst into his chest, knocking him unconscious.</p>
  <p>45 HUTCHINSON (OPTICAL)</p>

  <p>48 INT. MAIN ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> The room has been taken over by the terrorists. A<br>
    field diverter is sitting between the engine core and<br>
    the pool table and there are many pieces of odd<br>
    equipment lying about. The entire engine core is off.<br>
    Pomet and Satler are working on open Mees panels<br>
    located on the upper level of Engineering.</p>
  <p> Satler is checking something on a PADD as Pomet makes<br>
    adjustments in the panel.</p>

    It's clear.</p>
  <p> Satler turns and calls down to Neil.</p>
  <p> SATLER<br>

    We're ready up here.</p>
  <p>48A ANGLE ON KELSEY AND NEIL</p>
  <p> Kelsey is standing beside Neil, who is working on an<br>
    open Mees panel on the bulkhead near the pool table.<br>
    Kelsey is a tall, striking woman with an almost feline<br>
    grace and power. She is observing Neil as he makes<br>
    some adjustments to the circuitry with a DEVICE. Neil<br>
    is slightly built and has a nervous demeanor.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I... I know. But, I wanted to go<br>
    riding and I didn't have my<br>
    saddle, so I came back --</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>
    Your saddle?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's right. I left it in the<br>

    didn't know where to go so --</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>
    All right, shut up.<br>

    Sit down.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (meekly)<br>
    Sure, okay. You don't need to<br>

  <p> Picard sits down meekly and Satler stands near him with<br>

  <p>51 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard watches as Kelsey moves toward Pomet, who has<br>
    come down from the upper level of Engineering and is<br>
    working on a thermos-sized trilithium resin containment<br>
    unit.</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>

  <p> When Kelsey says the word &quot;trilithium&quot; Picard reacts<br>
    with dismay.</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>

    ... in there and secured before the<br>

    Understood.</p>
  <p> Pomet goes to work. Off Picard's expression as he<br>

  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>53 INT. ARKARIA BASE</p>
  <p> The hostages are standing in different parts of the<br>
    room. Orton is maintaining his cool composure,<br>
    watching the hostages with a calm expression while the<br>
    Waiter patrols the room occasionally.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Off to one side and away from the other hostages,<br>
    Beverly is kneeling on the floor next to an unconscious<br>
    Geordi, applying some lo-tech first aid. Hutchinson's<br>
    body lies near Geordi, but he's not moving.</p>
  <p>54 ANGLE - RIKER</p>
  <p> Standing near Troi. They converse sotto voice...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They haven't tried to communicate<br>
    with the outside.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No demands, no political<br>
    statements, no theft... they must<br>
    want something.</p>
  <p> Data moves to join them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Orton is not as calm as he looks.<br>
    He's very agitated and nervous...<br>
    as if something's gone wrong.</p>
  <p> Troi now casually moves away.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is possible that Geordi upset<br>
    their timetable when he saw the<br>
    hidden weapons.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Orton could be improvising...<br>
    maybe he didn't plan to take us<br>
    hostage this early... so now he<br>
    doesn't know what to do...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If they do not have a plan for<br>
    this contingency, we may have the<br>
    initiative.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nods)<br>
    Maybe, but we have to think of a<br>
    way to use it...</p>
  <p> Beverly now moves over to them -- Orton watching her<br>
    carefully the whole way.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    How's Geordi?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/93 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's no permanent damage. I've<br>
    adjusted the optical transducer in<br>
    his VISOR to block some of the<br>

    it's only partially effective.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about Hutchinson?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (grim)<br>
    There was nothing I could do for<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    (glances at Orton)<br>
    I doubt he'll agree to that.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If we told him Geordi was dying he<br>
    might give us access to a medical<br>
    kit... maybe we could make a<br>
    weapon from some of the tools...</p>
  <p> Data suddenly has an idea.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Perhaps we can use the VISOR as a<br>
    weapon. If the optical transducer<br>
    were modified, it may be possible<br>
    to generate a hypersonic pulse.</p>

  <p>54 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    A hypersonic pulse would overload<br>
    the audio receptors of everyone in<br>

    immediate unconsciousness.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Orton.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Beverly)<br>
    Can you make the adjustments to<br>
    the VISOR by yourself? It's going<br>
    to look suspicious if both of you<br>
    go over there.</p>
  <p> Beverly thinks for a moment.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'll try... Geordi may have to<br>
    help me through some of it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    All right... try to keep it<br>
    casual. Let us know when you're<br>

  <p> Satler comes around the corner and sees the now closed<br>
    hatch where Picard was at the end of Act Three.<br>
    Directly in front of the hatch, Picard's jacket is<br>
    lying on the floor of the tube. Satler moves to the<br>
    jacket and picks it up...</p>

    requires very specific equipment.<br>
    You can't simply improvise<br>
    something.</p>

  <p> KELSEY<br>
    I wouldn't need to improvise if<br>
    you hadn't damaged our field<br>

    But if you're so concerned about<br>
    the trilithium, I suggest you stop<br>
    interfering with us -- before you<br>
    set off an explosion that would<br>
    destroy the Enterprise... and you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I would rather destroy this ship<br>
    than allow that material to fall<br>

  <p> KELSEY<br>
    What makes you think I'm a<br>
    terrorist?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Trilithium resin is a highly toxic<br>
    waste material produced by our<br>
    engines. There's no possible use<br>
    for it except as a weapon.</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>
    You might be right, Mister Mott.<br>
    But we've been planning this for<br>
    a long time, and I doubt that<br>
    you'll really be able to stop<br>
    us... or even slow us down.</p>

    There. That should keep the resin<br>
    stable enough for transport.</p>
  <p> There is a beat, and then Kelsey reaches out and<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Picard takes the wand and touches it to the white<br>

    is a SMALL EXPLOSION and puff of smoke.</p>

  <p>120 CLOSE ON KIROS'S FEET</p>
  <p> as Kiros steps first onto the white, then directly onto<br>
    the black powder with the same foot. As soon as his<br>
    foot touches the second strip of powder, the chemicals<br>
    react and there is an EXPLOSION.</p>
  <p>121 WIDER</p>
  <p> As the explosion blows Kiros against the wall, knocking<br>
    her out. Picard takes advantage of the explosion and<br>
    whirls around... he lunges at Kelsey and knocks her to<br>
    the ground. She loses her grip on the thermos.</p>
  <p>122 THE THERMOS</p>
  <p> Bounces across the floor.</p>
  <p>123 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> As Picard moves for Kiros's weapon, which is on the<br>
    floor, but Kelsey recovers quickly and she catches him<br>
    with a well-placed kick. Suddenly a noise makes both<br>
    of them stop for a moment and turn toward the back<br>
    wall.</p>
  <p>124 ANGLE ON WALL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the BARYON SWEEP suddenly comes THROUGH the wall.</p>
  <p>125 KELSEY AND PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Kelsey and Picard react to the sight. Then Kelsey<br>
    swings at Picard and they begin to fight across the<br>
    room toward the windows... only a few feet ahead of<br>
    the BARYON SWEEP.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>125 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Kelsey knocks Picard back, goes for the thermos on the<br>
    floor, but then Picard lunges at her, knocking them<br>
    both to the ground... there is a brief struggle for<br>
    the thermos as they roll around on the ground...<br>
    finally Kelsey knocks him away and picks up her weapon.<br>
    Picard freezes as Kelsey takes the thermos.</p>
  <p> Kelsey's communicator begins to BEEP and FLASH.</p>
  <p> KELSEY<br>
    (touches her<br>
    communicator)<br>
    I guess, I'll be the one to send<br>
    your regrets.</p>
  <p> Before Picard can make another move, Kelsey and the<br>
    thermos DEMATERIALIZE.</p>
  <p>126 NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard looks around... trying to think of some way out.<br>
    But there's nowhere for him to go. He climbs up on a<br>
    window support, giving him a few extra seconds, but the<br>
    sweep is getting every closer. He adjusts the<br>
    communicator for a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Arkaria base, this is Captain<br>
    Picard. Deactivate the baryon<br>
    sweep.<br>
    (urgent)<br>
    This is Captain Picard on the<br>
    Enterprise. Deactivate the baryon<br>
    sweep immediately.</p>
  <p> He presses back against the window, still looking<br>
    around for some way out. Anything. And then... it<br>
    STOPS. The green glow fades.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Data to Captain Picard... do you<br>
    read me Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (keys it)<br>
    Picard here.</p>

  <p>127 INTERCUT - ARKARIA BASE</p>
  <p> Data is at the computer panel. Riker is keeping guard<br>
    on Orton and the Waiter in the b.g. and everyone looks<br>
    a little woozy still.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - REV. - 01/15/93 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>127 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you all right, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, an unidentified scout ship<br>
    has just beamed someone off the<br>
    Enterprise. Do you know anything<br>
    about it?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (beat; low)<br>
    I know they won't get very far.</p>
  <p>127A EXT. SPACE - SCOUT SHIP &amp; ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)<br>
    (Formerly Scene 130A)</p>
  <p> A small SCOUT SHIP is moving away from the Enterprise.<br>
    Suddenly the scout ship EXPLODES.</p>
  <p>127B INT. TEN FORWARD<br>
    (Formerly 130B)</p>
  <p> The ship rocks slightly from the o.c. explosion.<br>
    Picard is still looking out the windows.</p>
  <p> Picard unclinches his hand and looks down.</p>
  <p>128 OMITTED</p>
  <p>129 CLOSE ON PICARD'S HAND</p>
  <p> he's holding the safety pin from the thermos which he<br>
    had surreptitiously removed during the scuffle.</p>
  <p>130 RESUME PICARD</p>
  <p> Off his grim expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>131 EXT. SPACE - THE REMMLER ARRAY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise is still docked. It's all lit up, per<br>
    normal operation. The array is turned off.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/92 - ACT FIVE 59A.</p>
  <p>132 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Beverly is patching up Picard's bumps and bruises with<br>
    a medical DEVICE.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hold still... you've got a nasty<br>
    cut here...</p>
  <p> Troi ENTERS.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - REV. - 01/18/93 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>132 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Troi, very<br>
    concerned)<br>
    Any luck?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm sorry, Captain. I don't know<br>
    what could've happened to it.</p>
  <p> Riker ENTERS.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (shakes his head)<br>
    I've had three security teams<br>
    search deck seven and they<br>
    couldn't find anything.</p>
  <p> Picard's face falls.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (firm)<br>
    Hold still. I can't heal this<br>
    cleanly if you keep fidgeting.</p>
  <p> Worf finally ENTERS, awkwardly holding Picard's saddle<br>
    by one stirrup.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I found it, Captain. Someone put<br>
    it in a maintenance locker.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (takes saddle)<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> Worf looks puzzled at Picard.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You keep a saddle on board?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Worf, I'm surprised at you...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Any experienced rider would<br>
    naturally have his own saddle.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    It's perfectly normal.</p>
  <p> Beat.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Of course.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Starship Mine&quot; - 01/14/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>132 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It came in very handy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just wish I'd had a chance to<br>
    use it on a horse.</p>
  <p> Off their reactions...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
