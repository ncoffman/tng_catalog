  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker, Beverly, Geordi and Worf at the poker table.<br>
    Beverly is shuffling. Geordi notices that Worf is<br>
    looking at him peculiarly.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander... is it your intention<br>
    to continue growing your beard?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not sure, Worf. Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am just asking.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Seven-card stud, one-eyed jacks<br>
    are wild. Frankly, I like your<br>
    beard, Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Thanks, Doctor.</p>
  <p> She has finished dealing, and inspects the table.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The king is high... your bet, Wil.</p>
  <p> The players contribute chips during the next.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Of course, I'm always a little<br>
    suspicious of men with beards.</p>
  <p> In that she's sitting at a table with three bearded<br>
    men, this brings a reaction.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    For what reason?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know... it's as though<br>
    they're trying to hide something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hide -- ? Doctor, that's<br>
    ridiculous. Beards are a proud<br>
    and ancient tradition.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Some of the most esteemed men in<br>
    history had beards.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I know... but after the razor was<br>
    invented... I think beards became<br>
    mostly a fashion statement.</p>
  <p> She deals the next round.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am not concerned with fashion.<br>
    To a Klingon, a beard is a symbol<br>
    of courage.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I think it suggests a certain...<br>
    strength.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sure. After all, women can't grow<br>
    one.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor, I get the feeling you<br>
    think beards are nothing more than<br>
    an affectation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I do. I'm not saying there's<br>
    anything wrong with that... women<br>
    wear makeup and nail polish for<br>
    the same reason.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I just think you men should admit<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My beard isn't an affectation.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh? Then why not shave it off?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I could lose it in a minute.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've just gotten used to it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 10/06/92 - TEASER 1B.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Beverly glances around at all of them, then at her<br>
    hand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Okay... what do you say we up the<br>
    stakes a little? If I win this<br>
    hand... you all shave off your<br>
    beards.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What if one of us wins? What do<br>
    you give up?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    I'm open to suggestions...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I've always wondered what you'd<br>
    look like as a brunette...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I tried it once when I was<br>
    thirteen. I couldn't wait to<br>
    change it back.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That makes me even more curious...</p>
  <p> She gives him a look... so it's going to be like this,<br>
    is it? She glances down at her cards... obviously<br>
    feels very confident.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Fine. If one of you wins -- I<br>
    become a brunette. Are we on?</p>
  <p> There's a hesitation... they look at their cards...<br>
    then at each other, hoping someone has a good hand.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'll take that bet.</p>
  <p> Worf glares at him... he'd better have a good hand.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (are you sure?)<br>
    Geordi...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Sounds like you have the hand to<br>
    beat, Commander.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 10/06/92 - TEASER 1BA.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (Cont'd)<br>
    (tossing out chips)<br>
    I'm in for two hundred.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'll see that and raise two<br>
    hundred.</p>
  <p> He and Beverly stare at each other. She puts in the<br>
    chips.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Call.</p>
  <p> All eyes turn to Geordi... he looks at his cards...<br>
    takes a breath... starts to put them down...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    This is the Captain. We have<br>
    arrived at the Tyran system. All<br>
    senior staff to the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Geordi immediately throws down his cards, face down,<br>
    as do the others, making an indiscriminate pile. They<br>
    rise.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER 1C.</p>
  <p>A1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Wait --</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Sorry, Doctor, you heard the<br>
    Captain. Duty calls.</p>
  <p> He smiles sweetly as they head for the door.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm sure we can try this another<br>
    time.</p>
  <p> They all hurry out as Beverly stares after them,<br>
    frustrated.</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship is in orbit around the fiery, red moon of a<br>
    planet. A small SPACE STATION also orbits the moon,<br>
    and a glowing blue PILLAR OF ENERGY extends from the<br>
    station down to the surface of the moon.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, stardate 46307.2.<br>
    We have just come into orbit of<br>
    Tyrus-Seven-A to monitor progress<br>
    on the Tyran particle fountain,<br>
    a radically new mining technology.</p>
  <p>2 INT. STATION CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The station core is unfinished, with equipment consoles<br>
    scattered about. In several places, the walls are cut<br>
    through with holes which lead away to access tunnels<br>
    deep within the station. A Transporter pad and console<br>
    are in one corner. In the center of the floor is a<br>
    large, glowing circular core (similar to the<br>
    Enterprise's warp core).</p>
  <p> Several NDs are working in the b.g. The atmosphere<br>
    should be that of a large-scale construction project:<br>
    constant activity in the b.g., problems with equipment,<br>
    and the tension of working under a deadline.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    So far the project has been<br>
    fraught with problems, and is well<br>
    behind schedule. Mister La Forge<br>
    has been assigned to evaluate the<br>
    situation.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 10/02/92 - TEASER 1D.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI is standing with the project leader, DOCTOR<br>
    FARALLON. She's an attractive humanoid alien woman<br>
    about the same age as Geordi. They're discussing an<br>
    Okudagram of the particle fountain displayed on a wall<br>
    monitor. From the tone of Geordi's voice, it's clear<br>
    this isn't the first disagreement they've had.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality of Life&quot; - 9/28/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (patiently)<br>
    Doctor Farallon. The original<br>
    design called for the particle<br>
    fountain to lift five-hundred<br>
    kilograms per minute from the<br>
    surface -- so far it hasn't come<br>
    close to that.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    That's why I want to increase the<br>
    stream density -- that should<br>
    boost the lift capacity by<br>
    seventy-two percent.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... and overload the field<br>
    generators in the process.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (shakes her head)<br>
    Not if we distribute the overload<br>
    evenly throughout the system.</p>
  <p> Geordi regards her... an eager, ambitious young<br>
    woman... bright and dedicated, but a little strung out<br>
    right now with fatigue and the pressure of this<br>
    difficult project.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor... forgive me... but maybe<br>
    we should concentrate on getting<br>
    this phase of the project<br>
    completed... before we start<br>
    talking about re-designing it...</p>
  <p> Farallon stares at him... wilts a little.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Commander... I know you're here<br>
    to evaluate this project...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (acknowledging)<br>
    Starfleet is considering whether<br>
    to use a particle fountain on<br>
    Carema Three... they want to know<br>
    how feasible it is.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    And will your opinion be the<br>
    deciding factor?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 9/30/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not really... I'll make my report<br>
    to Captain Picard... he'll make<br>
    the official recommendation to<br>
    Starfleet... and they'll decide.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Well. What's your feeling so far?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess the question we have to<br>
    ask... is if this technology is<br>
    any more efficient than<br>
    conventional mining techniques.</p>
  <p> Farallon eyes him... and speaks with the utter<br>
    conviction of someone who is dedicated to her cause.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Commander... I know we've had<br>
    problems here. It seems like<br>
    nothing's gone right... it's<br>
    taking a lot longer than I thought<br>
    to get the particle stream to full<br>
    strength.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But I know it can work. This<br>
    is the direction mining will take<br>
    in the future... and it should<br>
    be implemented on Carema Three.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I agree that potentially it's very<br>
    exciting...</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I want to show you something I've<br>
    been working on... something that<br>
    might help us complete this<br>
    project more quickly.</p>
  <p> She moves toward an equipment locker.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I've used these on a limited<br>
    basis... I think they've earned<br>
    a try...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the LIGHTS DIM and the STATION TREMBLES.<br>
    ALARM KLAXONS begin to sound. Geordi and Farallon rush<br>
    over to check the readout on a wall panel. They<br>
    exchange a concerned look.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality of Life&quot; - 9/28/92 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENTERPRISE - MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> DATA sits at the Aft Science station, studying the<br>
    monitor with concern. WORF is at Tactical.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enterprise to Commander La Forge.<br>
    I am reading significant power<br>
    fluctuations from the station<br>
    core. Please report.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    La Forge here... there's been a<br>
    malfunction in one of the power<br>
    grids...</p>
  <p>4 INT. STATION CORE</p>
  <p> Lots of ND activity in the b.g. as Geordi and Farallon<br>
    work a pair of consoles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to COM)<br>
    ... we're losing particle stream<br>
    confinement.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality of Life&quot; - 9/28/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    Do you require assistance?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Stand by.</p>
  <p> Geordi turns to Farallon. He knows she isn't going to<br>
    like this, but the situation does not look good.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I think we're going to have to<br>
    shut it down.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    It took four months to get the<br>
    particle flux up to this level.<br>
    If we shut down, it'll take<br>
    another four months just to get<br>
    it back.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We have less than five minutes<br>
    before we lose confinement. When<br>
    that happens, the particle stream<br>
    will flood the entire station,<br>
    and then we'll have to shut it<br>
    down anyway.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Then we'll just have to fix the<br>
    power grid.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How do we do that?<br>
    (gesturing to a console)<br>
    The defective grid is two hundred<br>
    meters down conduit A-Four. We'd<br>
    have to disassemble four<br>
    bulkheads to get to it...</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Well... here's the perfect<br>
    opportunity to show you what I<br>
    had in mind...</p>
  <p> Geordi looks puzzled as she goes to the equipment<br>
    locker, opens it, and takes out --</p>

  <p>7 A STRANGE DEVICE</p>
  <p> It's a box-like device with a CONTROL PANEL with<br>
    flashing indicators and various sensor attachments --<br>
    this is an EXOCOMP. (Note: the exocomp should be<br>
    small enough to be carried easily by one person.)</p>
  <p>8 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> She takes a CONTROL PADD out of the locker. She moves<br>
    quickly to an access tunnel hole and places the<br>
    exocomp in front of it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    This is an exocomp -- the<br>
    experiment I was telling you<br>
    about...</p>
  <p> She quickly taps several commands into the PADD; the<br>
    panel on the exocomp flashes in response. (Note: a<br>
    subtle sound effect should indicate the exocomp in<br>
    operation.) She hits a final key on the control PADD.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 9/30/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p> THE EXOCOMP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> With a replicator-like effect, a new arm-like appendage<br>
    MATERIALIZES, attached to the exocomp. Then, the<br>
    exocomp RISES INTO THE AIR, and moves into the tunnel.</p>
  <p>10 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    If it doesn't work, we'll still<br>
    have time to shut down the<br>
    fountain...</p>
  <p>10A INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data studies his console.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Enterprise to La Forge... what<br>
    is your situation?</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Unchanged for the moment... but<br>
    we're working on it...</p>
  <p>10B INT. STATION CORE</p>
  <p> Farallon and Geordi stand at the access tunnel,<br>
    waiting.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If this doesn't work pretty soon,<br>
    I recommend you shut down...</p>
  <p> Farallon doesn't answer, just stares down the access<br>
    tunnel. Then suddenly, the station LIGHTS COME BACK UP<br>
    and the flashing ALARM LIGHTS TURN OFF.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (off console)<br>
    The confinement field is at full<br>
    strength... particle flux<br>
    steady... all power levels normal.</p>

  <p> Geordi looks at Farallon, amazed. She smiles<br>
    triumphantly and joins him at his console.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander La Forge, please report.</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    We're fine, Data. The power grid<br>
    has been fully restored.</p>
  <p> Data reacts, surprised.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    How were you able to accomplish<br>
    the repair so quickly?</p>
  <p> On the station, THE EXOCOMP EMERGES from the tunnel,<br>
    and drops slowly to the floor. The ARM DISAPPEARS<br>
    (OPTICAL). Geordi stares at it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You know... I'm not exactly sure.</p>

    Mister Data. I was hoping I'd<br>
    have a chance to meet you. I've<br>
    done extensive studies of your<br>
    positronic network.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And I have studied your design<br>
    for the particle fountain, Doctor.<br>
    I find the concept to be highly<br>
    innovative.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am curious how you were able<br>
    to repair the power grid so<br>
    quickly.</p>
  <p> Farallon taps the exocomp.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    This should make it clear,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We can set up in Engineering.</p>
  <p> He gestures toward the door and they move toward it;<br>
    but Farallon's attention remains firmly fixed on Data.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Is it true that your computational<br>
    speed is limited only by the<br>
    physical separation of your<br>
    positronic links?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Actually, that is no longer the<br>
    case.<br>

  <p> DATA (Cont'd)<br>
    I recently converted my main<br>
    interlink sequencer to<br>
    asynchronous operation, which<br>
    removed that performance<br>
    constraint.</p>
  <p> Geordi gently prods them toward the door.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor, this way please...</p>
  <p> Data and Farallon go out, still wrapped up in their<br>
    discussion.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I see. But how did you resolve<br>
    the signal fragmentation?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The interlink sequencer is now<br>
    bi-directional. It compensates<br>
    for...</p>

  <p> The exocomp is on the pool table. It has been opened<br>
    up, and inside is a complex mass of circuitry and<br>
    components.</p>
  <p>15 WIDEN TO INCLUDE</p>
  <p> Data, Geordi, and Farallon.</p>

  <p> FARALLON<br>
    We've been using devices like this<br>
    on Tyrus Seven for years... the<br>
    basic unit is a common industrial<br>
    servo-mechanism.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    A few years ago... I started<br>
    tinkering with one... this is the<br>
    result.</p>
  <p> Geordi is looking closely inside the device.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (impressed)<br>
    Boridium power converter...<br>
    axionic chip network... very<br>
    sophisticated.<br>
    (glancing at Data)<br>
    In terms of sheer computational<br>
    speed, this little guy could<br>
    almost compete with you, Data.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Oh, the exocomps don't come close<br>
    to Data's sophistication...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Exocomps... ?&quot;</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    That's what I call them.</p>
  <p> She closes up the exocomp and turns it on. The<br>
    exocomp panel light flashes, indicating that it is<br>
    active. She picks up the Control PADD.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Let's say you had an anti-matter<br>
    flow converter that was<br>
    fluctuating. How would you repair<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The correct procedure would be<br>
    to adjust the converter.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    With what?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A mode stabilizer.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; - REV. 9/30/92 - ACT ONE 11A.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Okay, let me input the problem<br>
    into the exocomp.<br>
    (as she taps commands)<br>
    ... a fluctuating anti-matter flow<br>
    converter...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Now let's see what happens.</p>
  <p> The exocomp's panel flashes.</p>

  <p>16 THE EXOCOMP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> With a replicator-life effect, a tech tool MATERIALIZES<br>
    on the exocomp.</p>
  <p>17 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Geordi studies the new tool and smiles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A mode stabilizer. Very nice.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You have incorporated a<br>
    micro-replication system into the<br>
    device... in order to fashion<br>
    tools.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    It's more than that. I designed<br>
    the exocomps to be problem<br>
    solvers. Whenever they perform<br>
    a task they've never done before,<br>
    the micro-replicator creates new<br>
    circuit pathways within the unit's<br>
    memory.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    So... in a sense, they are<br>
    &quot;learning.&quot;</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Exactly. The more situations they<br>
    encounter, the more circuit<br>
    pathways they build. They become<br>
    better tools as they work.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, it's impressive technology,<br>
    no doubt about it. Once it's out<br>
    of the experimental stage there'll<br>
    be plenty of applications --</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Commander, I'm hoping the<br>
    experimental stage is over.</p>

  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When are we supposed to brief<br>
    Captain Picard on the status of<br>
    the particle fountain?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    At sixteen hundred hours.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Good. I have something to ask<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>17A OMITTED</p>
  <p>18 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Farallon is there with Picard, Data, and Geordi.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Captain, I know you're supposed<br>
    to give your evaluation to<br>
    Starfleet today. I'd like you<br>
    to postpone that report another<br>
    forty-eight hours.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Enterprise is scheduled to<br>
    leave the Tyran System tomorrow.<br>
    If I'm to change that plan, I'll<br>
    need a good reason.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I realize that, sir.</p>
  <p> She hesitates, looks around the room, then plunges in.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; REV. 9/29/92 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    If you're going to make a<br>
    recommendation to Starfleet about<br>
    using the particle fountain on<br>
    Carema... it seems only fair that<br>
    you see it working at full<br>
    strength.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I think I can complete the<br>
    project... and boost the<br>
    efficiency of the particle<br>
    stream... if I use exocomps --<br>
    the new devices I've constructed.</p>
  <p> Picard ponders this.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand one of these devices<br>
    successfully repaired the faulty<br>
    power grid...</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Yes, sir. I've been testing them<br>
    on a limited basis, but I think<br>
    they're ready to be used on a<br>
    larger scale.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, what are your<br>
    thoughts?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess the only risk... is<br>
    falling even further behind.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I'm willing to take that risk.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality of Life&quot; - 9/28/92 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>18 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The exocomps are highly<br>
    sophisticated devices, sir. If<br>
    they perform to expectations,<br>
    their potential to advance this<br>
    project is considerable.</p>
  <p> Farallon can't help but smile at Data's vote of<br>
    confidence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm inclined to agree. I don't<br>
    think forty-eight hours is too<br>
    much time to risk -- particularly<br>
    when the gains might be<br>
    substantial.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You may proceed, Doctor.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Thank you, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If possible, I'd like Commander<br>
    Data to work with me.</p>
  <p> Picard glances at Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Doctor. I would<br>
    welcome the opportunity.</p>
  <p> Picard rises, signalling the end of the meeting.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>19 INT. STATION CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data watches carefully as an exocomp works on a<br>
    darkened console. A panel is open, and a robot-like<br>
    arm sprouting from the exocomp is working inside.<br>
    Suddenly, the darkened console LIGHTS UP and hums to<br>
    life.</p>
  <p> Farallon comes up to Data.</p>

  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Commander. There's a plasma<br>
    conduit in one of the access<br>
    tunnels that's ready to be<br>
    sealed. It's the perfect job for<br>
    an exocomp.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I agree, Doctor.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality of Life&quot; - 9/28/92 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>19 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Farallon points out one of the conduit openings. Data<br>
    takes out the control PADD and taps in commands. The<br>
    exocomp PANEL FLASHES in response and...</p>

  <p> It ENTERS THE TUNNEL.</p>
  <p>21 RESUME SCENE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Well, Mister Data. What is your<br>
    analysis so far?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have successfully completed<br>
    fourteen separate tasks with this<br>
    exocomp in the past hour. I<br>
    estimate it would have taken two<br>
    people nine hours to accomplish<br>
    the same tasks. I would<br>
    characterize the unit's<br>
    performance as excellent.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (pleased)<br>
    I hope Commander La Forge and<br>
    Captain Picard agree with you.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am confident that they will.<br>
    Commander La Forge is an excellent<br>
    --</p>
  <p> At that moment, the EXOCOMP EMERGES FROM THE TUNNEL<br>
    and settles slowly to the ground. Puzzled reactions<br>
    from Data and Farallon.</p>
  <p> Farallon picks up the exocomp and puts it on a table.<br>
    She checks a console readout.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (puzzled)<br>
    It didn't finish sealing the<br>
    plasma conduit.<br>

  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data taps some commands into the control PADD, but this<br>
    time there are no corresponding flashes from the<br>
    exocomp -- it is completely unresponsive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is not accepting my commands.</p>
  <p> Farallon takes the PADD from Data.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Maybe there's a malfunction in<br>
    its control processor. Let me<br>
    see if I can override it...</p>
  <p> She begins to work the PADD. and the PADD OVERLOADS<br>
    in a surge of electricity. Startled, she drops the<br>
    PADD.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor --</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>

    I'm all right. The control padd<br>

    What's the matter with this thing?</p>
  <p> They're both looking curiously at the exocomp when<br>

  <p> Geordi with Data and Farallon, examining the<br>
    unresponsive exocomp. Geordi's in the process of<br>
    connecting an optical cable from the exocomp to a<br>
    computer console.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    The exocomp came out of the<br>
    plasma conduit... we tried to<br>
    override the commands and send<br>
    it back in... but it just -- shut<br>
    down. It's been completely<br>
    unresponsive ever since.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Let's see what our computer has<br>
    to say...</p>
  <p> He makes the final connection and a nearby monitor<br>
    reveals a SCHEMATIC which shows a dense, chaotic web<br>
    of circuit pathways within the exocomp. Some of the<br>
    lines are dark to indicate that they are not<br>
    functioning.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The interface circuitry which<br>
    links the exocomp to the control<br>
    padd has been completely burned<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's strange... is there any<br>
    evidence of secondary power<br>
    surges?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> Geordi points to a section of the monitor.</p>

  <p> The monitor now displays a MAGNIFIED portion of the<br>
    internal circuitry.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interesting... the number of<br>
    circuit pathways within the<br>
    exocomp has increased by<br>
    six-hundred thirty-two percent.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Oh, no...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> Farallon is not surprised... but she is disappointed.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Sometimes an exocomp starts<br>
    forming large numbers of new<br>
    pathways -- totally at random.<br>
    Eventually, it reaches a point<br>
    where it shuts down. Just like<br>
    this one.</p>
  <p> She disconnects the optical cable from the ship's<br>
    computer. Data is puzzled at the peremptory move.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Doctor... the new pathways do not<br>
    appear to be interfering with the<br>
    original circuitry --</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (explaining)<br>
    Once an exocomp is this badly<br>
    corrupted, it's useless. You have<br>
    to erase the unit and start all<br>
    over again. And there's no time<br>
    for that now.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That leaves you with only two of<br>
    them... it's going to slow you<br>

    Yes, Commander. You have the<br>
    right to point out that you told<br>
    me so...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I just wanted to say that we'll<br>
    be happy to add an extra shift<br>
    to take up the slack...</p>
  <p> Farallon stops, a little embarrassed.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>

    Why did that plasma conduit<br>
    explode?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Apparently there was a<br>

  <p> Data reacts to Geordi's statement. He had not<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, are you implying that the<br>

    You're right about that,<br>

    patiently. Beverly seems more excited than hurt.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Doctor, if you wish to master the<br>

    What can I do for you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I would like to ask you a<br>
    question. What is your<br>
    definition of life?</p>
  <p> Beverly gives him a look -- that's a tall order.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's a big question, Data. Why<br>
    are you asking?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am searching for a definition<br>
    which will allow me to test an<br>
    hypothesis.</p>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Well, the broadest scientific<br>
    definition might be... that<br>
    life is what enables plants and<br>
    animals to consume food... derive<br>
    energy from it, grow, adapt<br>
    themselves to their<br>
    surroundings... and reproduce.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And you would suggest that<br>
    anything which exhibits those<br>
    characteristics would be<br>
    considered alive?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    In general, yes.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What about fire?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Fire?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. It consumes fuel to produce<br>
    energy... it grows... it creates<br>
    offspring... by your definition,<br>
    is it alive?</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles... he's finding the exception to the<br>
    rules.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Fire is a chemical reaction. You<br>
    could make the same argument for<br>
    growing crystals... but obviously,<br>
    we don't consider them alive.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And what about me? I do not<br>
    grow... I do not reproduce...<br>
    and yet I am considered to be<br>
    alive.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's true. But then you're<br>
    unique.</p>

    I am curious... as to what<br>
    transpired between one moment<br>
    when I was nothing more than an<br>
    assemblage of parts in Doctor<br>
    Soong's laboratory... and the<br>
    next moment when I became<br>
    &quot;alive.&quot; What was it that endowed<br>
    me with life?</p>
  <p> Beverly smiles at a recollection.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I remember Wesley asking me a<br>
    similar question when he was<br>
    little. I tried desperately to<br>
    give him an answer... but<br>
    everything I said sounded<br>
    inadequate.</p>

    everything she says.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Then I realized that scientists<br>
    and philosophers had been<br>
    grappling with the same question<br>
    for centuries... without coming<br>
    to any conclusion.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Are you saying that the question<br>
    can never be answered?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No... I think I'm saying that we<br>
    struggle all our lives to answer<br>
    it... and it's the struggle that's<br>
    important. That's what helps us<br>
    define our place in the universe.</p>
  <p> Data regards her calmly for a moment.</p>

    Captain, I object to being called<br>

    be better spent elsewhere.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doctor, I appreciate the time<br>
    constraints you're under. But<br>
    recognizing new life -- whatever<br>
    its form -- is the principal<br>
    mission of this vessel.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Mister Data, what makes you think<br>
    the exocomps could be alive?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, when the exocomp left the<br>
    access tunnel prior to the<br>
    explosion, I believe it may have<br>
    been attempting to save itself<br>
    from destruction.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Do you have any basis for that<br>
    conclusion?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe so. When you attempted<br>
    to override the exocomp and send<br>
    it back into the tunnel, it<br>
    responded by deliberately burning<br>
    out its control interface.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Deliberately?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Quality... &quot; REV. 9/29/92 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>29 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The computer diagnostic showed<br>
    that the exocomp disabled its own<br>
    interface.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    That could have been nothing more<br>
    than a malfunction...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    However, two hours later, when<br>
    the exocomp was aboard the<br>
    Enterprise and no longer in<br>
    danger... it repaired itself.</p>
  <p> There is a small silence at this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I believe that the exocomp was<br>
    protecting itself. And if that<br>
    is true, it has demonstrated an<br>
    awareness of its environment --<br>
    and an ability to adapt to that<br>
    environment.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    You're anthropomorphizing these<br>
    units. Like any mechanical<br>
    device, they occasionally<br>
    malfunction. One time, I saw an<br>
    exocomp enter a reaction chamber<br>
    for no apparent reason and<br>
    vaporize itself. Is that supposed<br>
    to make me think it was suicidal?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Doctor, why is it so difficult<br>
    for you to accept the fact that<br>
    the exocomp could be alive?<br>
    (re: Data)<br>
    After all, you're talking to a<br>
    living machine right now.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    And I have nothing but the utmost<br>
    respect and admiration for Doctor<br>
    Soong's accomplishment. But his<br>
    intention was to create an<br>
    artificial life form...<br>

    tool.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There is a big difference between<br>
    a humanoid and a virus, Doctor.<br>
    But both are alive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If the possibility exists... no<br>
    matter how slight... that the<br>
    exocomps are lifeforms, then we<br>
    must examine that possibility.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir. And until we have<br>
    a definitive answer, I believe<br>
    that it is inappropriate to<br>
    exploit the exocomps as laborers.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Captain, that's absurd.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    If they are intelligent life<br>
    forms, we have no right to force<br>
    them to work for us.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Data, you're claiming that this<br>
    exocomp may be alive because it<br>

    What we've done is to recreate<br>
    a situation similar to the one<br>
    the exocomp encountered in the<br>
    plasma conduit.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We have created a small conduit<br>
    breach in this tube. The exocomp<br>
    would normally require several<br>
    minutes to complete this type of<br>
    repair. However, once it enters<br>
    the tube, it will find that a<br>
    plasma cascade failure is in<br>
    progress.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I assume that is only a<br>
    simulation...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yes, sir. We're running a<br>
    transient overload signal that<br>
    will simulate a failure in exactly<br>
    one minute.</p>
  <p> Farallon has finished programming the exocomp and has<br>
    joined the group.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    If the exocomp does possess a<br>
    survival instinct, as Mister Data<br>
    claims... it should exit the tube<br>

  <p> Farallon is at a console, talking to Geordi and Picard.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    We're definitely making progress,<br>
    Captain. I'm not sure we'll be<br>
    at full capacity within the<br>
    forty-eight hour deadline... but<br>
    we'll be close.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It looks like there's still some<br>
    difficulty with the phase<br>
    selectors...</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    That's true... but I'm sure it's<br>
    the last real problem.</p>
  <p> She is quietly determined... but Picard, though kindly,<br>
    sees it differently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For the sake of the project, I<br>
    hope you're right.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I understand, sir. We're going<br>
    to do our best --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the STATION LIGHTS GO OUT. After a moment,<br>
    the red BACK-UP LIGHTS TURN ON (Note: the alarms do not<br>
    sound here). Farallon is obviously disappointed. She<br>
    moves over to study a console, and Geordi and Picard<br>
    follow.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    (off console)<br>
    This is strange. Primary power<br>
    is still on-line.</p>

    Maybe it's another power grid<br>
    malfunction?</p>
  <p> Farallon works the console; she looks worried.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I don't think so... something<br>
    seems to be drawing power into<br>
    the main particle impeller.<br>
    That's not a good sign. It could<br>
    mean --</p>
  <p> Suddenly, there's a tremendous EXPLOSION which rocks<br>
    the entire station. The ALARM KLAXONS begin to sound.<br>
    In the center of the room, the core begins to RIPPLE<br>
    WITH ENERGY, filling the room with a FLICKERING GLOW.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    We've lost internal<br>
    confinement... the particle<br>
    stream is beginning to surge.</p>
  <p> Geordi checks the console and turns quickly to Picard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (urgently)<br>
    Captain, a radiation field is<br>
    going to flood this chamber.<br>
    If we don't get everybody out of<br>
    here immediately...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Understood. Doctor, we are<br>
    evacuating this station.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Captain, I might still be able<br>
    to --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That is an order, Doctor.<br>
    Assemble all personnel on the<br>
    Transporter pad, now!</p>
  <p> Farallon realizes that it's the only choice. She makes<br>
    no further protest and rushes to get her people<br>
    together. Picard on the move hits his COM.</p>

  <p> Picard herds two NDs onto the Transporter pad. Geordi<br>

    explosions continue to go off in the b.g. Picard is<br>
    not on the pad.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The radiation is setting up a<br>
    field ionization effect, sir.<br>
    We've got less than a minute to<br>
    beam out.</p>
  <p> Farallon rushes over with two more NDs and they all<br>
    crowd onto the platform.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is this everybody?</p>
  <p> Farallon takes a quick head count.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Where's Takenta?</p>
  <p> She points toward the far corner of the station.</p>

    impeller control.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    I'll get him, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi immediately turns and heads away into the<br>
    darkened station and Picard takes his place at the<br>
    console. A tense beat passes. Suddenly we hear a<br>
    muffled explosion.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge!</p>
  <p> There is no answer and sign of Geordi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stand by to transport.</p>
  <p> Picard hits the panel. The Transporter effect<br>
    begins...</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Captain -- you'll be trapped here<br>
    --</p>
  <p> ... and Farallon and her team DEMATERIALIZE. Picard<br>
    moves back through the station.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge... Mister La<br>
    Forge!</p>
  <p> In the far corner of the station, Geordi is on his<br>
    hands and knees. Beside him is the motionless body<br>
    of an ND. Both their uniforms are blackened from an<br>
    explosion. Picard rushes over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Geordi, are you all right?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm okay... I only caught the edge<br>
    of it...</p>
  <p> Picard looks at the ND body.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    He's dead, sir.</p>
  <p> Picard looks from the body to the glowing core. The<br>
    implications are clear: they could both soon be joining<br>
    him. Off their reactions.</p>

    feeling of urgency as Picard moves a final console into<br>
    place.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain, if I can access the field<br>
    emitters, we should be able to<br>
    establish a force field... see<br>
    if you can link your console to<br>
    my command system sub-routine.</p>

    I'm reading power fluctuations...<br>
    the field's not stable...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... the radiation levels are<br>

    I can program their boridium power<br>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    The radiation levels are too high,<br>

    for detonation... however, they<br>
    may have an alternate solution.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    Something we haven't considered?<br>
    Now you're suggesting they have<br>
    superior intelligence.</p>

  <p>48 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not at all... but they do have<br>
    superior experience, Doctor...<br>
    during their service, they have<br>
    interfaced with every part of the<br>
    station core... something none<br>
    of us has done, including<br>
    yourself. They may have another<br>
    way to control the particle surge.</p>
  <p> KELSO<br>
    Sir... new coordinates are being<br>
    fed to the Transporter -- by the<br>
    exocomps.<br>
    (beat as he studies)<br>
    The coordinates are inside the<br>
    station core.</p>
  <p> Data, Farallon, and Riker exchange glances. This seems<br>
    pretty conclusive evidence.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Kelso -- energize.</p>
  <p> KELSO<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p>49 INT. STATION CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The exocomps MATERIALIZE near the damaged core.<br>
    Picard, working on his console, sees them arrive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge...</p>
  <p> Geordi moves toward him, sees the exocomps. They are<br>
    now arranged around the core in a triangular pattern.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What are they up to?</p>
  <p> The exocomps MATERIALIZE identical tools.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Those look like power-taps of some<br>
    kind...</p>
  <p> Now, an energy beam jumps from one exocomp's tool to<br>
    the core... a leaping pulse of phased energy... now<br>
    the second exocomp does the same... then the third...</p>

  <p>49 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's exactly what they are...<br>
    the exocomps are siphoning off<br>
    power from the core...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They're trying to distort the<br>
    particle stream frequency. That<br>
    might open up a window that the<br>
    Enterprise can use to beam us<br>
    out...</p>
  <p> They watch expectantly as the exocomps continue<br>
    working.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If they can modulate the radiation<br>
    field... it'll work. But they'll<br>
    have to get the sub-harmonic<br>
    frequencies to resonance...</p>
  <p> Geordi checks his console...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The particle stream frequency is<br>
    fluctuating... they're having<br>
    trouble controlling the<br>
    feedback... it may be more power<br>
    than they can handle...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Can we help them? Is there any<br>
    way we can moderate the power<br>
    transfer?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've done all we can, sir... it's<br>
    up to them now.</p>
  <p> There is an anxious moment... and then suddenly there<br>
    is a qualitative change in the SOUND from the exocomps.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    This is incredible... they're<br>
    balancing the power absorption<br>
    rates...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It's working... the particle<br>
    stream is beginning to distort...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Almost at resonance...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    They've got it.</p>

    Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>

    Can you lock on to the exocomps?</p>
  <p> KELSO<br>

    I'm trying, sir...</p>
  <p>50A INT. STATION CORE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Two of the exocomps begin to DEMATERIALIZE... one of<br>
    them remains intact, projecting the energy beam...<br>
    making it possible for the other two to transport.<br>
    Then they are gone... it is left alone... the energy<br>
    beam DISAPPEARS. The exocomp BEEPS once... and then<br>
    its lights blink out one by one.</p>
  <p>50B INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> The two exocomps are in place on the platform. Kelso<br>
    is working at the console.</p>

  <p>50B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KELSO<br>
    I'm sorry, sir. I was only able<br>
    to lock onto two of them.<br>
    For some reason I couldn't fix a<br>
    signal on the other one.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    One of them had to continue<br>
    disrupting the particle stream...<br>
    absorbing that much power would<br>
    prevent a signal lock...</p>

    It was the only way to save the<br>
    other two.</p>

  <p> Picard, Data, and Farallon.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I must admit you've given me a<br>
    lot to think about, Commander<br>
    Data... I'm not exactly sure what<br>
    the exocomps are... but you can<br>
    be assured that until I do, I<br>
    won't be treating them as simple<br>
    tools.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Doctor.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I wish your work on the particle<br>
    fountain had been more<br>
    successful... perhaps the exocomps<br>
    will be able to help you to<br>
    re-construct it.</p>
  <p> FARALLON<br>
    I hope they will...<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    ... and I predict in a year or two<br>
    you'll be able to recommend the<br>
    technology to Starfleet.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'll look forward to it.</p>
  <p> She smiles her good-bye and EXITS, but Data does not<br>
    follow her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Something more, Mister Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes, sir. I thought you might<br>
    be curious why I would be willing<br>
    to risk your life for several small<br>
    machines.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think I understand the<br>
    predicament you were in. It<br>
    cannot have been an easy choice.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    No, sir. It was not. Several<br>
    years ago, when my status as a<br>
    living being was in question,<br>
    you fought to protect my rights<br>
    -- and for that, I will always<br>
    be grateful.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The exocomps had no such advocate,<br>
    sir. If I had not acted in their<br>
    behalf, they would have been<br>
    destroyed. I could not allow that<br>
    to happen.</p>
  <p> Picard understands, and is touched by Data's<br>
    sentiments.</p>
