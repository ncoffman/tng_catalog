    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> orbiting a RED GIANT GASEOUS PLANET.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46271.5.<br>
    The Enterprise has entered orbit<br>
    of Deinonychus Seven. But our<br>
    scheduled rendezvous with the<br>
    supply ship Biko has been delayed<br>
    for another forty-eight hours.</p>
  <p>2 OMITTED</p>
  <p>3 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> PICARD is sitting in a chair, playing a quiet MELODY<br>
    on his FLUTE (as seen in &quot;The Inner Light&quot;). Over the<br>
    com system, two other instruments can be heard -- a<br>
    CLARINET and a CELLO. Picard is playing along with<br>
    the music form a pleasant harmony.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In the meantime, many members of<br>
    the crew are taking advantage of<br>
    the delay to pursue their own<br>
    projects... myself included.</p>
  <p> After a few measures, Picard stops playing -- something<br>
    doesn't sound quite right.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- stop playback.</p>
  <p> The music STOPS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Change the clarinet to an oboe.<br>
    Continue recording.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard listens as the music PLAYS BACK -- the same<br>
    melody, but now the CLARINET is an OBOE. He begins to<br>
    play the flute along with the music...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Pause program.</p>
  <p> The music STOPS. Picard sets his flute aside.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> GEORDI and DATA ENTER. Geordi is enthusiastic about<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Captain -- we'd like permission<br>
    to take the Engineering computer<br>
    off-line for a couple of hours.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    We've been working on a new<br>
    interface that'll allow Data to<br>
    act as an emergency back-up in<br>
    case of a ship-wide systems<br>
    failure.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    In theory, my neural network<br>
    should be able to sustain key<br>
    systems until primary control is<br>
    restored.</p>
  <p> Picard considers -- it sounds like an interesting<br>
    notion, but he's not really in the mood for talking<br>
    tech.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It sounds like an intriguing<br>
    experiment. I'll be very<br>
    interested to see the results.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Permission granted.</p>
  <p> Excited by the prospects, Geordi continues...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's possible we may even be able<br>
    to run secondary systems through<br>
    Data. Weapons control... sensor<br>
    arrays...</p>
  <p> Picard nods, growing slightly impatient.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. I get the idea, Mister La<br>
    Forge. Thank you. Please<br>
    proceed.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods and EXITS with Data. Picard takes a moment<br>
    to clear his thoughts... then picks up his flute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- record again from the<br>
    first measure.</p>
  <p> The other two MUSIC tracks start to play. He takes a<br>
    breath... then begins to PLAY the tranquil flute melody<br>
    again... a few measures go by...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. Picard stops playing, slightly<br>
    annoyed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer -- pause program.</p>
  <p> The music STOPS.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY ENTERS. She looks determined about something.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Jean-Luc, I need to talk with you<br>
    about &quot;Something for Breakfast.&quot;</p>
  <p> Picard looks her, at a loss.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (prompting)<br>
    The play.</p>
  <p> Picard nods, remembering -- tries to ease out of the<br>
    subject.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah... yes... a very intriguing<br>
    drama. But I really don't have<br>
    the time it would take to learn<br>
    a part. And anyway, I'm not much<br>
    of an actor...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's no problem. You wouldn't<br>
    be playing one of the leads.</p>
  <p> Picard is surprised -- and just a little hurt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Oh.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's a very small part. Only two<br>
    lines in the whole play.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Really.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You play the butler.</p>
  <p> A long beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me read the play again...<br>
    and I'll let you know.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You'll be wonderful, Jean-Luc.<br>
    Rehearsal's at one thirty this<br>
    afternoon.</p>
  <p> Picard nods. Beverly turns and EXITS. Picard takes<br>
    a breath to recenter himself... then brings the flute<br>
    to his mouth...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer -- continue recording.</p>
  <p> The MUSIC plays. He begins to play the flute again...<br>
    the soft melody...</p>
  <p> The door CHIMES. Picard reacts, annoyed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Enter.</p>
  <p> WORF ENTERS, stops at the desk.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, I am sorry to interrupt,<br>
    but I wanted to consult you<br>
    regarding the duty roster.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Proceed.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/18/92 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I was hoping we could take<br>
    advantage of the Biko's delay by<br>
    staging shipwide security drills.<br>
    I have planned a tentative<br>
    schedule...</p>
  <p> Worf hands Picard a PADD. Picard looks it over.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very impressive, Mister Worf.<br>
    But we'll be taking on new<br>
    personnel at Starbase One-Eighteen<br>
    in a few weeks. Surely the drills<br>
    can wait until then.</p>
  <p> A beat. Worf seems intent on having something to do.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    In that case, I will use the time<br>
    to perform maintenance checks on<br>
    the forward phaser array.</p>
  <p> Picard looks at Worf a moment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf... is there some<br>
    reason you're trying to give<br>
    yourself more work?</p>
  <p> Worf hesitates, awkward.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No sir. I simply wished to use<br>
    the extra time to...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (cutting in)<br>
    ... Enjoy yourself. You have some<br>
    free time. Use it.</p>
  <p> Worf nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (6)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf turns and EXITS. Picard breathes a sigh of<br>
    relief.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer, once more from the top.</p>
  <p> As the MUSIC starts to play...</p>
  <p>4 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf ENTERS the room, where ALEXANDER is waiting for<br>
    him. Alexander rushes up to him, excited about<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    What did he say?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Captain saw fit to release<br>
    me from my duties.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You mean, you can go?</p>
  <p> Worf settles into a nearby chair... resigned... but<br>
    he is not happy about what he's about to do...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I can go.</p>
  <p> Alexander reaches offscreen and grabs a nearby COWBOY<br>
    HAT. As he places the hat on Worf's head...</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Saddle up, Father!</p>
  <p> OFF Worf's look of resignation...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.) </p>
  <p>5 EXT. HOLODECK - WESTERN STREET - DAY</p>
  <p> A street right out of the OLD WEST. DIRT ROAD, WOODEN<br>
    BUILDINGS, TOWNSFOLK, HORSES. There's a SALOON with a<br>
    sign out front that reads &quot;The Gold Strike Saloon&quot;...<br>
    and there's a SHERIFF'S OFFICE. The street is quiet on<br>
    this day... not a lot of activity... just a few<br>
    townsfolk mingling about... the wind curling up dust...</p>
  <p> CUT TO VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE STREET:</p>
  <p>6 AN OLD MAN</p>
  <p> sitting in a rocking chair on a porch, rocking slowly<br>
    back and forth, making a continuous CREAKING sound.<br>
    The man puffs on his pipe, hat pulled down over his<br>
    eyes to block the sun...</p>
  <p>7 A HORSE</p>
  <p> attached to a hitching post.</p>
  <p>8<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    9</p>
  <p>10 THE OLD MAN</p>
  <p> rocking in his chair... creaking... Suddenly he STOPS<br>
    rocking. Silence. The man tilts his head upward<br>
    slightly to look at the road. Gradually, the SOUND of<br>
    FOOTSTEPS can be heard... coming closer...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>11 A PAIR OF BOOTS</p>
  <p> A large pair of boots on large feet, taking large<br>
    steps, spurs jangling, stirring up dust...</p>
  <p>12 THE HORSE</p>
  <p> stomps and whinnies nervously, as if in response...</p>
  <p>13 THE BOOTS</p>
  <p> come to a stop. A second later, more FOOTSTEPS are<br>
    heard and a second PAIR OF BOOTS comes into view -- a<br>
    very small pair by comparison. Big boot, little boots.</p>
  <p>14 THE OLD MAN</p>
  <p> squinting into the sun to see who is there...</p>
  <p>15 WIDE ANGLE - WORF AND ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> wearing the boots, standing side by side -- lone<br>
    figures on the Western street. They are both dressed<br>
    in WESTERN ATTIRE, holsters and GUNS at their sides.<br>
    They each wear an old-style BADGE on their chest. They<br>
    are lawmen.</p>
  <p> After a beat, they continue walking... surveying the<br>
    town. Alexander is excited to be here. Worf is wary<br>
    of the whole venture.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Where are we?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Deadwood, South Dakota...<br>
    nineteenth century Earth.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Ancient West.</p>
  <p> Worf gazes at the surroundings.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is our function here?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    You're the Sheriff... and I'm your<br>
    deputy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We are in charge of law<br>
    enforcement?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> A WOMAN in bawdy apparel walks past -- clearly a &quot;lady<br>
    of the night&quot; -- and she throws Worf and Alexander a<br>
    come-hither look. Worf reacts -- quickly moves<br>
    Alexander away from the woman.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You wrote this Holodeck program<br>
    yourself?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Well... Mister Barclay helped a<br>
    little.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to himself)<br>
    I must talk with Mister Barclay...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, a GUNSHOT is heard somewhere offscreen. Worf<br>
    and Alexander react, then head in the direction of the<br>
    shot...</p>
  <p>16 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit around the red giant planet.</p>
  <p>17 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data, Geordi and VARIOUS N.D.s. Data is sitting by an<br>
    opened console. A panel on his head is OPEN, revealing<br>
    various circuitry within. Fiber-optic cables connect<br>
    Data's circuits to the console circuits.</p>
  <p> Geordi is making a connection on Data's head. Data<br>
    looks at Geordi's face for a second.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi... I have noticed that you<br>
    have not shaved in several days.<br>
    Are you attempting to grow another<br>
    beard?</p>
  <p> Geordi rubs a hand over his face.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    As a matter of fact, I am...<br>
    (re: beard)<br>
    What do you think?</p>
  <p> Data eyes him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    As is the case with many natural<br>
    growth processes, it is difficult<br>
    to envision the end product based<br>
    on an intermediate stage.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're right -- give it a few more<br>
    days.</p>
  <p> Geordi completes the connection on Data's head.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... I'll need to access your<br>
    auxiliary inputs...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    One moment.</p>
  <p> Data reaches for his head, and REMOVES another panel in<br>
    his head, revealing the circuitry underneath.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi eyes him a moment, then begins to connect a<br>
    cable to the circuitry...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I have to admit, Data... I never<br>
    get used to seeing you like<br>
    this...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not understand. You are<br>
    constantly working on similar<br>
    electronic systems, yet their<br>
    appearances do not disturb you.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, well... you're not just<br>
    another electronic system.</p>
  <p> Data thinks this over.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, Geordi. Nor are you<br>
    just another biological organism.</p>
  <p> Geordi smiles, appreciating the sentiment. He<br>
    completes the adjustments to Data.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That should do it. Are you ready?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am establishing computer<br>
    link-up...</p>
  <p> The circuits on Data's head begin to BLINK faster.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Interface complete.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Alright... let's see what you can<br>
    do...</p>
  <p> As Geordi works...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>18 OMITTED</p>
  <p>19 INT. GOLD STRIKE SALOON</p>
  <p>20 CLOSE ANGLE - A WANTED POSTER</p>
  <p> attached to a wall in the room. The poster shows a<br>
    drawing of a man's face and the words &quot;WANTED: DEAD OR<br>
    ALIVE.&quot; There is a fresh bullet hole in the forehead<br>
    of the man. Two more GUNSHOTS ring out, and we see<br>
    two more BULLET HOLES RIP through the drawing of the<br>
    man's face...</p>
  <p>21 REVEAL - ELI HOLLANDER</p>
  <p> holding a smoking pistol, having just fired the shot.<br>
    Clearly, this is the same man as in the poster. He is<br>
    a young, cocky, dangerous gunslinger.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    (re: poster)<br>
    If I ever find the varmint who<br>
    drew this... he'll be sorry he<br>
    ever put pen to paper.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm ten times uglier than that,<br>
    ain't I?</p>
  <p> We hear someone LAUGH from offscreen --</p>
  <p>22 INCLUDE - THE ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A smoky barroom occupied by several PEOPLE. A PIANO<br>
    PLAYER sits at the piano, picking out a jaunty tune.<br>
    The barkeep, a pretty woman named ANNIE MEYERS, stands<br>
    behind the bar, glaring at Eli.</p>
  <p> Eli's henchman -- a MEXICAN BANDITO, complete with<br>
    sombrerro, etc. -- is sitting nearby, laughing.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    (to Bandito)<br>
    Shut up.</p>
  <p> The Bandito falls silent.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    You laugh so much, it's a wonder<br>
    flies don't live in your mouth...</p>
  <p> The Bandito laughs at the remark, missing the point.</p>

    (Mexican accent)<br>
    You are a very funny man, Senor<br>
    Eli...</p>
  <p> The bandito stops laughing as he notices Worf and<br>
    Alexander ENTER the saloon. Eli follows his gaze, sees<br>
    Worf, and his eyes narrow. Everyone in the room turns<br>
    and looks. The room falls silent.</p>
  <p> Alexander points to Eli, relishing every moment of the<br>
    program.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (quietly, to Worf)<br>
    That's the bad guy. His name's<br>
    Eli Hollander -- they call him<br>
    &quot;The Butcher of Bozeman.&quot; He's<br>
    killed twenty-three men.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He's the meanest, toughest<br>
    gunslinger in the West. You have<br>
    to watch him... He's fast...</p>
  <p> Worf eyes Eli.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    So I am here to apprehend him?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    If you can.</p>
  <p> Worf nods, now understanding his job -- confident.</p>

  <p>22 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Worf walks across the saloon. Eli walks toward him<br>
    too. The jangle of spurs is heard in the silent room.<br>
    The onlookers watch nervously. Worf and Eli stop a<br>
    couple of feet away from each other... steely-eyed...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Eli)<br>
    You are under arrest.</p>
  <p> Eli sneers.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    Is that so --</p>
  <p> Before Eli can finish, Worf quickly PUNCHES him,<br>
    knocking the man cold with one shot. Eli drops to the<br>
    floor. The bandito reacts, too shocked to make a move.<br>
    Worf bends down and grabs Eli by the collar, lifts him<br>
    up.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You will come with me.</p>
  <p> Worf begins to drag Eli out of the saloon. Alexander<br>
    looks upset -- this isn't what he had in mind.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    No, no, no...<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- freeze program.</p>
  <p> Everything in the saloon FREEZES.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    What is wrong?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    That was too easy. It's gotta<br>
    be harder to beat the bad guys.<br>
    Otherwise, it's no fun.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Oh.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- increase program<br>

    EXIT...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>

  <p> attached to a wall. There is one fresh bullet hole<br>
    in the forehead of the drawing of Eli Hollander. Two<br>
    more GUNSHOTS ring out, and we see two BULLET HOLES<br>
    RIP through the poster...</p>

  <p> holding a smoking pistol, having just fired the shot.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>

  <p> Eli's henchman, the bandito, laughs.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    Shut up.</p>
  <p> The bandito falls silent.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    You laugh so much, it's a wonder<br>
    flies don't take up residence in<br>
    your mouth...</p>
  <p> The bandito laughs.</p>
  <p> BANDITO<br>
    You are a very funny man, Senor<br>
    Eli...</p>
  <p> The bandito falls silent as Worf and Alexander ENTER<br>
    the saloon.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Eli sees them too, and his eyes narrow. Everyone in<br>
    the room turns and looks. The room falls silent. The<br>
    patrons of the bar suddenly realize they are in the<br>
    line of fire -- and they scatter, many of them leaving<br>
    the saloon. An open space is left between the two men.</p>
  <p> Worf watches the commotion in confusion.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Where are they going?</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (quietly, to Worf)<br>
    They don't want to get hit by the<br>
    bullets.</p>
  <p> Worf reacts... braces himself, then takes a step toward<br>
    Eli.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Eli)<br>
    You are under arrest --</p>
  <p> Instantly, Eli's hand moves to the butt of his pistol.<br>
    Alexander stops Worf.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (whispers, urgent)<br>
    He's getting ready to draw.</p>
  <p> Worf puts his hand to the butt of his own gun. A tense<br>
    moment as the two men stare at each other across the<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> Eli breaks the moment by adopting a wide smile. His<br>
    hand hangs down by his gun at all times.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    (to his henchmen)<br>
    Well... looks like Sheriff Worf<br>
    is here to arrest me. Don't sound<br>
    like a very bright idea... does<br>
    it?</p>
  <p> The bandito shakes his head, stands and opens his coat<br>
    to reveal a SHOTGUN.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Eli)<br>
    You have been accused of<br>
    committing a homicide.</p>

  <p> ELI<br>
    If you mean murder, then I guess<br>
    I'm guilty.</p>
  <p> Eli slowly walks up to Worf, giving him a hard stare.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I've killed twenty-three men,<br>
    Sheriff... one more ain't gonna<br>
    make that much of a difference.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT ONE 16.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> Worf doesn't flinch. Eli continues to goad Worf.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    'Course... shootin someone as ugly<br>
    as you... could hardly be<br>
    considered a crime.</p>
  <p> The bandito laughs. Worf bristles, angry -- it's all<br>
    he can do to hold himself back.</p>
  <p> ELI<br>
    Were you just born that way...<br>
    or did your momma marry an<br>
    armadillo?</p>
  <p> More laughter. For the briefest instant, Eli's gaze<br>
    darts to one side, just behind Worf. Worf sees it,<br>
    realizes, and whirls around just in time to get a chair<br>
    BROKEN across his back by a SECOND HENCHMAN. (NOTE:<br>
    This being a Holodeck act of violence, Worf is<br>
    unfazed.) Worf SLUGS the henchman, who goes flying<br>
    backward onto the floor.</p>
  <p> The bandito moves to grab Worf, but Worf blocks his<br>
    arms and lands a punch into his stomach -- then a hard<br>
    hook across his face. The bandito goes CRASHING<br>
    through a nearby table.</p>
  <p> Eli grabs a nearby BOTTLE and breaks it against the<br>
    bar -- comes at Worf with the broken shards. Worf<br>
    overcomes Eli with a series of well-timed PUNCHES.<br>
    Eli falls to the floor, dazed.</p>
  <p> Worf looks at Alexander -- he's starting to enjoy<br>
    himself.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am beginning to see the appeal<br>
    of this program...</p>
  <p> Alexander grins -- then sees something.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Sheriff, look out!</p>
  <p> Eli is drawing his pistol. Worf tries to grab his own<br>
    gun -- but he's too late. Outdrawn.</p>
  <p> ELI (O.S.)<br>
    Don't twitch a whisker, Sheriff...<br>
    (waves gun)<br>
    'Less you want a shave.</p>

  <p> The bandito and the henchmen move to Worf and grab him<br>
    from behind. Worf struggles, but it's no use.<br>
    Alexander watches helplessly. Eli aims his gun at<br>
    Worf, smirking, triumphant... relishing the moment...</p>

  <p> standing at the door, holding a Winchester RIFLE,<br>
    having just fired the shot. The figure re-cocks the<br>
    rifle, keeps it aimed. The figure wears a wide-brimmed<br>
    hat that obscures his face. A beat goes by, then the<br>
    stranger raises his head slightly...</p>
  <p> It is TROI.</p>

    I suggest you find a new line of<br>

  <p> Reactions. Worf is surprised by the sight. Eli sees<br>
    that he is defeated... scowls and de-cocks his pistol.<br>
    The bandito and the henchman release their grip on<br>
    Worf. Alexander smiles, leans toward Worf.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    (whispers)<br>
    I asked Counselor Troi to join<br>

  <p> Eli stares at Troi, who stares right back at him,<br>

  <p>36 INT. REHEARSAL ROOM</p>
  <p> Beverly is using the space to rehearse the play.<br>
    RIKER and TWO CREWMEMBERS make up the cast. They are<br>
    sitting in a semi-circle, listening to Beverly's<br>
    direction. Everyone is holding a PADD.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Let's read through Act Two. From<br>
    the beginning...</p>
  <p> Riker looks at his PADD and begins to read...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (reading)<br>
    &quot;Felis catus is your taxonomic nomenclature<br>
    An endothermic quadraped, carnivorous... &quot;</p>
  <p> Over this, Beverly reacts to what she hears --<br>
    something doesn't sound right.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Hold it... Wil, what are you<br>
    reading?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    My lines. Why?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's not the right dialogue...</p>
  <p> Riker looks at the PADD, confused. Beverly crosses<br>
    to Riker and looks at his PADD. She reads aloud...</p>

  <p> Riker starts to realize...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Wait a second... I recognize<br>
    this... It's Data's poetry.</p>
  <p> Beverly looks at her own PADD, hits a few commands into<br>
    it, reads the screen... hits a few more commands.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The play's gone. I just keep<br>
    getting more poetry...</p>
  <p> As they exchange a mystified look...</p>
  <p>37 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data are examining opened PADDs. Several<br>
    other PADDs are sitting nearby. Beverly watches,<br>
    curious. Geordi sets aside the PADD.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well.. the PADDs are functioning<br>
    normally...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It seems to be a problem with the<br>
    information retrieval net. For<br>
    some reason, when you tried to<br>
    bring up your play, the computer<br>
    accessed Data's literary files.</p>
  <p> Data thinks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, perhaps this problem is<br>
    related to our interface<br>
    experiment.</p>
  <p> Geordi nods.</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We'd better run a Level Two<br>
    diagnostic on the computer. See<br>
    if the problem has spread to any<br>
    other systems...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And I will perform a<br>
    self-diagnostic.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Good idea.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS. Geordi starts to work a console.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You'll let me know if you find<br>
    the play?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah... Don't worry, it's in here<br>
    somewhere.</p>
  <p> Beverly nods. As Geordi works...</p>

  <p> CLOSE ON Alexander walking along, holding a small<br>
    canvas BAG. He opens up the bag and peers inside,<br>
    shakes the bag a little, causing it to JANGLE -- it's<br>
    obviously full of money. He smiles and continues to<br>
    jangle the bag...</p>
  <p> From offscreen, a HAND grabs Alexander by the shoulder.<br>
    Alexander stops, startled, and slowly looks up...</p>
  <p> Standing over him are Eli's two henchmen seen earlier<br>
    -- the bandito and the henchmen. Alexander reacts --<br>
    but before he can say a word, one of the henchmen<br>
    clamps a giant hand over his mouth. Alexander<br>
    struggles as they carry him away...</p>
  <p>38A INT. MINES</p>
  <p> A short time later. The bandito and the henchmen are<br>
    leading Alexander through the dark, abandoned tunnel.<br>
    Alexander's hands are tied together with a rope, his<br>
    mouth gagged by a bandanna.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT TWO 30.</p>
  <p>38A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> We hear FOOTSTEPS approach them. They look up to see<br>
    a SHADOWY FIGURE step into view, dressed in all black<br>
    -- this is FRANK HOLLANDER, Eli Hollander's father.<br>
    His face is obscured by shadow.</p>
  <p> BANDITO<br>
    (re: Alexander)<br>
    We got him...</p>
  <p> The henchman removes the bandanna from Alexander's<br>
    mouth. The shadowy figure speaks in a cold and<br>
    menacing voice...</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    (to Alexander)<br>
    Where's my boy?</p>
  <p> Alexander struggles to escape, confused by this turn<br>
    in the program.</p>

    I'm not supposed to be kidnapped<br>
    now...<br>

  <p> Nothing happens. Alexander grows alarmed.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Hey!<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- freeze program!</p>
  <p> No response. Alexander is restrained by the henchman.<br>
    He is scared now -- no longer a cowboy, but a little<br>
    boy in peril...</p>
  <p> BANDITO<br>
    (to figure, re;<br>
    Alexander)<br>
    You want us to kill him, Senor<br>
    Frank?</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    No...</p>
  <p> The figure takes a step forward. As he comes into the<br>
    light, we see that HIS FACE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE DATA'S<br>
    FACE. He stops and stares down at Alexander.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    He's more valuable to us alive.</p>

    Spot, I have formulated a new<br>
    mixture of foods specifically<br>
    tailored to your highly selective<br>

  <p> Spot sniffs at the food... doesn't seem to like it...<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Puzzling. I find it extremely<br>
    difficult to predict what you will<br>
    find acceptable.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Perhaps hunger will compel you<br>
    to try it again.</p>
  <p> Data crosses to his desk and sits down. He begins to<br>
    work the console. Spot JUMPS UP onto the control<br>
    panel, making it impossible for Data to work. Data<br>
    watches him a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Spot, you are disrupting my<br>
    ability to work.</p>
  <p> Data gently nudges him aside. But Spot remains on the<br>
    desk. Data tries to keep working, but it is difficult.</p>
  <p> Data gives Spot a more forceful push off the desk --<br>
    his face revealing the merest hint of annoyance.</p>

  <p> A beat. They stand and exchange a look -- safe but<br>

    about something.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... Alexander has been gone<br>
    for over half an hour. Shouldn't<br>
    he be back by now?</p>
  <p> Worf considers. He's enjoying this program, and is<br>
    eager to get back into the story.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes... I will go find him.<br>
    (re: Eli)<br>
    Watch the prisoner.</p>
  <p> Troi nods and picks up her rifle. Worf EXITS. Troi<br>
    sits down at the desk and looks at Eli. Eli starts<br>

  <p> Various townsfolk are present; the piano player is<br>
    playing a tune. Worf ENTERS the saloon, takes a look<br>

    What'll it be?</p>
  <p> Worf looks up, see Annie Meyers standing behind the<br>
    bar. Clearly, she is still bitter at Worf.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I am looking for my deputy.<br>

    Maybe I should bring you a sherry.<br>
    That is what they serve over at<br>
    Miss Langford's, ain't it?</p>
  <p> Before Worf can respond, Annie walks off.</p>
  <p> From offscreen, we HEAR the GALLOP OF SEVERAL HORSES<br>
    outside the saloon. People turn to look, curious at<br>
    the commotion. We hear the horses come to a stop,<br>
    whinnying... the sound of men dismounting the horses...<br>
    then FOOTSTEPS on the wooden porch of the saloon...</p>
  <p>44 ON THE DOORS</p>
  <p> as they swing open and Data/Frank Hollander ENTERS<br>
    along with the bandito and the henchman.</p>
  <p> The room falls silent. An ominous beat as they scan<br>
    the room... and spot Worf at the bar. They take a few<br>
    steps toward the bar counter. Data/Frank's manner is<br>
    polite but menacing.</p>

  <p> WORF<br>
    You are right...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I will begin by speaking to the<br>
    people of this town. Perhaps<br>
    someone witnessed Alexander's<br>
    abduction.</p>
  <p> Troi nods -- good idea. Worf moves to the door,<br>
    unlocks it and carefully peers outside -- the coast<br>
    is clear. He EXITS. Troi glances at the jail cell,<br>
    where Data/Eli is sitting on the cot, quietly playing<br>
    solitaire...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We think our interface experiment<br>
    may have caused one of the<br>
    computer's core subroutines to<br>
    be altered.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    When the interface malfunction<br>
    occurred, subroutine C-forty-seven<br>
    was replaced by elements of my<br>
    personal programming.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What does C-forty-seven control?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Library computer access...<br>
    replicator selection...<br>
    recreational programming... No<br>
    critical systems.</p>

    That would explain why your music<br>

  <p> Picard reacts -- he hasn't heard about this one yet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (explains)<br>
    The replicators on Decks Four<br>
    through Nine have started<br>
    producing nothing but cat food.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Cat food?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have been formulating<br>
    nutritional supplements for Spot.</p>
  <p> Picard considers the situation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    When can you have the problem<br>
    corrected?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We are currently attempting to<br>
    isolate the corrupted circuit<br>

    has not noticed the slip.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p>50 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I said the process would take less<br>
    than two hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No -- you said &quot;I reckon... &quot;</p>
  <p> Data thinks.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    According to my memory log, I did<br>
    not use those words.<br>
    (Texan accent)<br>
    Ya'll must be mistaken.</p>
  <p> Reactions.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    There, Data, You did it again.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (Texan accent)<br>
    Did whut?</p>
  <p> Reactions -- what the hell's going on? Data looks at<br>
    them, puzzled.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge -- perhaps you<br>
    should take Mister Data to<br>
    Engineering. See if you can find<br>
    the problem.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Aye sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Data rise to go. As they walk toward the<br>
    door, Data hitches his thumbs into his waistband and,<br>
    with a slight bow-legged swagger, EXITS the room.</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker exchange a glance. OFF their puzzled<br>
    reactions...</p>
  <p>51 INT. HOLODECK - SHERIFF'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Troi is pacing nervously, rifle in-hand. She glances<br>
    out the window... moves back to the desk... waiting...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> From offscreen, Data/Eli can be heard SHUFFLING his<br>
    deck of cards. Troi ignores it at first,<br>
    preoccupied... then she takes note. The card shuffling<br>
    seems to be getting faster and faster... like it's<br>
    being done at increasingly high speeds...</p>
  <p> Troi listens for a moment, curious. Then she crosses<br>
    to the jail cell and peers inside. She reacts to what<br>
    she sees --</p>
  <p>52 ANGLE ON DATA/ELI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> sitting on the cot, SHUFFLING the deck of cards at<br>
    HYPER SPEED -- android speed. He proceeds to deal a<br>
    hand of solitaire at hyper-speed... then plays out the<br>
    game at hyper-speed...</p>
  <p> Troi stares at him, realizing. Data/Eli stops and<br>
    looks right at her.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELI<br>
    Can I help you with somethin?</p>
  <p> There's a knock at the door. Troi quickly moves to<br>
    the door... unlocks the bolt... opens the door a crack<br>
    to see who's there, then opens it. Worf ENTERS,<br>
    looking urgent.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I spoke to several witnesses.<br>
    One saw Alexander being abducted<br>
    as he was leaving the bank... by<br>
    Hollander's men.</p>
  <p> Worf crosses to the desk, opens a drawer and starts<br>
    to look for something. This is a bizarre and<br>
    frightening situation, but Worf is intent on getting<br>
    out of it.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We will begin a systematic search<br>
    of the town...</p>
  <p> Worf removes a boxful of BULLETS and sets them on the<br>
    desktop -- begins to shove bullets into his pocket.<br>
    Troi glances at the jail cell, troubled.</p>

  <p>52 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Worf... we've got another<br>
    problem. I saw Eli shuffling his<br>
    cards. He was doing it the way<br>
    Data does when he plays poker...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He doesn't just look like Data...<br>
    he has Data's abilities. And<br>
    his father probably does, as<br>
    well...</p>
  <p> Worf stops and looks at the cell, disturbed by the<br>
    news.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FOUR 50.</p>
  <p>52 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> A knock at the door. Worf and Troi exchange a look.<br>
    Troi raises her rifle and Worf draws his gun. Worf<br>
    moves to the door, unbolts it, and eases it open.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank Hollander is standing in the doorway. Troi<br>
    reacts -- it's the first time she's seen him.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Howdy, Sheriff.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I came to see my boy.</p>
  <p> Troi points her rifle in his general direction.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Remove your weapon.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank smiles and takes his gun out of his holster<br>
    -- offers it handle-first to Worf.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    (re: gun)<br>
    Take a good look at that gun,<br>
    Sheriff... you might see it again<br>
    real soon.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank enters the room. He walks toward the cell,<br>
    eager to see his son.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Eli?</p>
  <p> Inside the cell, Eli jumps to his feet and grips the<br>
    cell bars.</p>
  <p> DATA/ELI<br>
    Pa!</p>
  <p>53 ANGLE ON DATA/FRANK AND DATA/ELI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> standing face to face, separated by the cell door.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    How have they been treating you,<br>
    son?</p>
  <p> DATA/ELI<br>
    Real bad, Pa. They ain't fed me<br>
    since I got here... and the<br>
    Sheriff's been roughin me up<br>
    somethin fierce.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FOUR 51.</p>
  <p>53 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Don't you worry. The Sheriff will<br>
    pay for this.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank throws a look at Worf and Troi.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    (re: Troi)<br>
    Who's the stranger?</p>
  <p> DATA/ELI<br>
    Don't know... she ain't said her<br>
    name. But she's in cahoots with<br>
    the Sheriff... and she's mighty<br>
    mean with a Winchester.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank nods.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Sit tight, boy. I'll have you<br>
    home in time for supper.</p>
  <p>54 RESUME SCENE</p>
  <p> Data/Frank moves to Worf and Troi, adamant.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    I'll give you one more opportunity<br>
    to avoid an ugly situation,<br>
    Sheriff. Release my boy.</p>
  <p> Worf bristles, but plays along.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I have... reconsidered your offer.<br>
    I will release your son... in<br>
    exchange for my deputy.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank smiles -- clearly, he's a man who is used<br>
    to winning.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    I thought you might have a change<br>
    of heart...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Meet me in two hours. You be<br>
    in front of the saloon... I'll<br>
    be in front of the livery station.</p>
  <p> Worf nods.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FOUR 52.</p>
  <p>54 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank moves toward the door -- Worf hands him his<br>
    gun. Data/Eli stops at Troi and gives her a hard look.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    (to Worf, re; Troi)<br>
    Strangers ain't invited.</p>
  <p> Troi narrows her eyes at him. Data/Frank EXITS. Worf<br>
    turns to Troi, relieved. But Troi looks concerned<br>
    about something...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    In every Western I've ever read,<br>
    the villains break their word.<br>
    We can't trust him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    But we have made an honorable<br>
    agreement.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They're not concerned with honor,<br>
    Worf. This is the Ancient West.<br>
    There's a gunfighter out there<br>
    who can shoot with the speed and<br>
    accuracy of an android...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And in two hours, he's going to<br>
    try to kill you.</p>
  <p> OFF Worf and Troi's concern as the gravity of the<br>
    situation sinks in...</p>

  <p>55 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> orbiting the red giant.</p>
  <p>56 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Data is sitting by a console, a panel in his head open,<br>
    being examined by Geordi. Riker ENTERS and crosses<br>
    to them. Data has gotten worse -- he slips in and out<br>
    of a Texan accent throughout the scene, completely<br>
    unaware of his bizarre behavior.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker, Texan accent)<br>
    Howdy, Commander.</p>
  <p> An awkward beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Mister La Forge... what have you<br>
    found?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (Texan accent)<br>
    Well... we figure parts of my<br>
    memory structure...<br>
    (normal voice)<br>
    ... have been replaced with<br>
    information from the computer's<br>
    recreational data-base.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Specifically, files relating to<br>
    the nineteenth century American<br>
    West.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That explains the accent...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (Texan accent)<br>
    That's right, partner.</p>
  <p> Riker and Geordi exchange a look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Is this another result of the<br>
    interface experiment?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>56 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm afraid so. But we've<br>
    initiated a progressive memory<br>
    purge to restore Data's programming<br>
    to its original state.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He should be back to normal in<br>
    a few hours.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about the computer's<br>
    recreational data-base?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    We've started a memory purge<br>
    there, as well. It'll take<br>
    another hour... maybe two.</p>
  <p> Data tips an invisible hat to Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (Texan accent)<br>
    You just sit tight, Commander.<br>
    We'll have it fixed up in time<br>
    for supper.</p>
  <p> Riker nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Good.</p>
  <p> As Riker turns to go...</p>
  <p>57 INT. HOLODECK - SHERIFF'S OFFICE</p>
  <p>58 CLOSE ON A MAP</p>
  <p> A hand-drawn map of the center of town, laid out on the<br>
    Sheriff's desk. Worf has made the map himself. He<br>
    is pointing to one end of town with a stylus -- an<br>
    inkwell is close at hand.</p>
  <p> WORF (O.S.)<br>
    I will be positioned here, at the<br>
    Eastern end of the street...</p>
  <p> He points to the West end.</p>
  <p> WORF (O.S.)<br>
    Frank Hollander says he will<br>
    approach from this end...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>59 INCLUDE THE SCENE</p>
  <p> Worf and Troi are looking at the map, speaking softly,<br>
    so Data/Eli cannot hear. On the desktop, we can see<br>
    Worf and Troi's communicators laid out. They are<br>
    having a makeshift tactical conference. There is a<br>
    sense of urgency in the air as they plan a strategy.</p>
  <p> Worf dips the stylus into the inkwell and draws an &quot;X&quot;<br>
    in the middle of the street.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (re: &quot;x&quot;)<br>
    Once he gets to this point, he<br>
    will be within range.</p>
  <p> Troi studies the map. She nods, anxious but<br>
    determined.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Understood.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    What about Alexander?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    There is a rain barrel in front<br>
    of the saloon. It should be<br>
    enough to stop the bullets.</p>
  <p> There's a KNOCK at the door. Troi grabs her rifle and<br>
    Worf moves to the door, unlocks it and opens it a<br>
    crack. Annie Meyers ENTERS, carrying a wooden BOX full<br>
    of various EQUIPMENT -- wire coils, transformer<br>
    batteries, etc. She speaks to Worf in an urgent<br>
    whisper.</p>
  <p> ANNIE<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    You wouldn't believe what I went<br>
    through to talk Old Man Newsome<br>
    out of his telegraph machine...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>59 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf looks pleased.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Excellent.</p>
  <p> Worf takes the box and crosses to the desk... rummages<br>
    through the box and finds a small PEN KNIFE. He picks<br>
    up one of the communicator pins and OPENS it... then<br>
    grabs a coil of copper wire, breaks off a length, and<br>
    begins to connect the wire to the communicator circuits<br>
    with the pen knife...</p>
  <p> ANNIE<br>
    (expecting a response)<br>
    Lord knows why I keep riskin my<br>
    life for you, Sheriff...</p>
  <p> Worf ignores her. Troi nudges Worf to respond.<br>
    Begrudgingly, Worf tips his hat to Annie.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Annie)<br>
    Thank you, Ms. Annie. I am...<br>
    in your debt.</p>
  <p> Annie brightens -- that's enough for her.</p>
  <p> Worf glances up at a CLOCK on the wall.</p>
  <p>60 ANGLE - THE CLOCK</p>
  <p> It reads four o'clock...</p>
  <p> DISSOLVE TO:</p>

  <p>61 THE CLOCK</p>
  <p> It now reads five fifteen.</p>
  <p>62 INCLUDE THE ROOM</p>
  <p> Worf is making some last-minute adjustments to a DEVICE<br>
    attached to his holster -- it's a small metallic box,<br>
    fashioned from spare parts. Copper wiring connects<br>
    the device to a communicator pin on Worf's vest.</p>
  <p> Troi walks over to him, eyeing the device (Annie is<br>
    gone).</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How long will the field last?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    It is highly unstable. No more<br>
    than fifteen seconds.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Let's hope that's enough.</p>
  <p> Worf nods. OFF his look of concern...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>63 EXT. WESTERN STREET - DAY</p>
  <p> WIDE ANGLE on the same street seen earlier. But it<br>
    is now empty, except for a couple of TOWNSPEOPLE who<br>
    are hurrying on their way. A sense of foreboding is<br>
    in the air...</p>
  <p> Visible in the frame is a RAIN BARREL sitting on the<br>
    street in front of the Gold Strike saloon... as well<br>
    as a nearby COVERED WAGON...</p>
  <p>64 NEW ANGLE - STREET</p>
  <p> Data/Frank steps into view, holding Alexander by the<br>
    arm. He stops, waiting. Somewhere, A CHURCH BELL<br>
    starts to TOLL... six times total throughout the<br>
    scene...</p>
  <p> Data/Frank pulls out a cigar and sticks it in his<br>
    mouth. He strikes a match... and stops in mid-motion<br>
    at what he sees...</p>
  <p> INTERCUT:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>65 ANGLE - WORF</p>
  <p> walking to his spot at the opposite end of the street.<br>
    He still wears the make-shift device on his holster,<br>
    and the communicator pin on his chest. Data/Eli is<br>
    at his side.</p>
  <p> Data/Frank smiles, and lights up his cigar. A tense<br>
    beat goes by. Then Data/Frank gives Alexander a little<br>
    shove. Alexander stumbles forward... then begins a<br>
    tentative walk down the street toward Worf...</p>
  <p> Worf nudges Data/Eli, sending him on his way toward<br>
    Data/Frank...</p>
  <p> Play the suspense as the two prisoners make the long<br>
    walk down the empty street... At one point, as they<br>
    pass each other, and they exchange a look. Alexander<br>
    reacts to the sight of Data...</p>
  <p> Alexander comes closer and closer to Worf, almost<br>
    within reach. As he approaches, Worf sends a<br>
    deliberate glance toward the nearby rain barrel.<br>
    Alexander glances at it too... understanding that Worf<br>
    wants him to see it...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Data/Frank lets out a loud WHISTLE --</p>
  <p>66 DATA/HENCHMAN</p>
  <p> emerges from behind a building. (The same henchman<br>
    seen earlier, but now he resembles Data.)</p>
  <p>67 DATA/BANDITO</p>
  <p> appears on the second story balcony of a building,<br>
    pistol drawn, and looks down at the scene.</p>
  <p>68 DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> calls out to his son --</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Eli -- down!</p>
  <p> It all happens at once:</p>
  <p>69 DATA/ELI</p>
  <p> drops to the ground...</p>

  <p> draws his pistol...</p>
  <p>71 WORF AND ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (calls out)<br>
    Alexander!</p>
  <p> Alexander quickly takes cover behind the rain barrel<br>
    as Worf hits a switch on the device attached to his<br>
    holster --</p>
  <p>72 DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> OPENS FIRE on Worf with android proficiency --</p>
  <p>73 WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As he is hit by the first TWO BULLETS, a FORCE FIELD<br>
    activates around his body, deflecting the bullets in<br>
    crazy ricochets. (NOTE: The force field should look<br>
    unstable and staticky.) Worf stumbles backward from<br>
    the impact of the hits... tries to keep his balance...</p>
  <p>74 ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> crawls out from behind the rain barrel and into the<br>
    safety of the saloon... stops just inside the door and<br>
    peers out so he can watch the gunfight...</p>
  <p>75 DATA/ELI</p>
  <p> gets to his feet and out of the line of fire...</p>
  <p>75A DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> relentlessly takes aim again...</p>
  <p>76 WORF (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> takes the impact of TWO MORE BULLETS, the FORCE FIELD<br>
    FLASHING AND FRITZING with every strike... looking more<br>
    unstable with every hit. Another BULLET hits... then<br>
    another BULLET and the FORCE FIELD FRITZES OUT<br>
    COMPLETELY. Worf reacts, realizing he's vulnerable --<br>
    hits the switch on the device but it won't work...</p>

    run out of bullets. His six-shooter CLICKS<br>
    empty... click, click, click...</p>
  <p> From offscreen --</p>
  <p> DATA/BANDITO (O.S.)<br>
    Senor Frank!</p>
  <p> The sequence plays out in SLOW MOTION:</p>
  <p>78 THE BANDITO</p>
  <p> throws his pistol down to Data/Frank...</p>
  <p>78A WORF</p>
  <p> drops his hand to his holster and tries to draw his gun<br>
    -- fumbles with the gun... can't get it out...<br>
    suspense builds...</p>
  <p>78B THE BANDITO'S GUN</p>
  <p> as it TUMBLES through the air...</p>
  <p>78C WORF</p>
  <p> manages to draw his gun... takes aim... awkwardly<br>
    starts to cock the hammer back...</p>
  <p>79 DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> catches the gun with android skill and moves to shoot<br>
    Worf...</p>
  <p> RESUME NORMAL MOTION:</p>
  <p>80 WORF</p>
  <p> FIRES his gun at Data/Frank...</p>
  <p>81 DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> as the gun is BLOWN out of his hand. He reacts,<br>
    outdrawn.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>82 ANGLE - DATA/ELI AND DATA/HENCHMAN</p>
  <p> as they start to take a step toward Worf. Behind them,<br>
    the canvas flap on the covered wagon drops open to<br>
    reveal Troi. She aims her Winchester rifle in their<br>
    direction and COCKS it.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Datas)<br>
    Don't even think about it.</p>
  <p> The two Datas stop, turn to look... they raise their<br>
    arms into the air, defeated...</p>
  <p>83 DATA/BANDITO</p>
  <p> sees the danger of the situation...</p>
  <p>84 ANGLE - WORF AND DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> staring each other down. Data/Frank spreads his arms<br>
    wide and just stands there, staring at Worf defiantly.</p>
  <p> DATA/FRANK<br>
    Go ahead and shoot me.</p>
  <p> Worf glares at him, his Klingon instincts flaring to<br>
    the surface... he cocks his pistol... a tense beat goes<br>
    by... then he glances toward the saloon...</p>
  <p>85 ALEXANDER</p>
  <p> is peering out from the doorway, anxiously waiting to<br>
    see what Worf will do...</p>
  <p>86 WORF AND DATA/FRANK</p>
  <p> Worf thinks it over... keeps his pistol trained...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Data/Frank)<br>
    Do not show your face in this<br>
    town again.</p>
  <p> A beat. Then Data/Frank scowls and turns to go...</p>
  <p> Worf watches them go. Troi moves to his side, rifle<br>
    in-hand. They exchange a grim look, then head toward<br>
    the saloon...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 59A.</p>
  <p>87 INT. GOLD STRIKE SALOON</p>
  <p> The room is empty, except for Alexander, who is<br>
    standing by the door, peering outside. Worf and Troi<br>
    ENTER.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Father!</p>
  <p> Alexander embraces Worf, grateful to see him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Are you alright?</p>
  <p> Alexander looks at him and nods.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> Worf glances around the room, suddenly concerned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>87 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- end program.</p>
  <p> Nothing happens. A tense beat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't understand this. The<br>
    story should be over... what's<br>
    left?</p>
  <p> From offscreen --</p>
  <p> DATA/ANNIE (O.S.)<br>
    Sheriff... Sheriff!</p>
  <p>88 INCLUDE DATA/ANNIE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> ENTERING the saloon -- she now LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE DATA.</p>
  <p> DATA/ANNIE<br>
    You're as handy with a<br>
    shootin'-iron as you are with a<br>
    lady's heart!</p>
  <p> Data/Annie rushes to Worf and wraps her arms around<br>
    him, giving him a big kiss. Worf reacts, disgusted.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to computer)<br>
    Computer -- end program!</p>
  <p> The saloon VANISHES and the familiar GRID appears. As<br>
    Worf, Troi and Alexander exchange a look of relief...</p>
  <p>89 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> in orbit, facing another SHIP -- the Biko.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 46278.3.<br>
    Both Commander Data and the ship's<br>
    computer have been restored to<br>
    normal operation. Our rendezvous<br>
    with the supply ship Biko has<br>
    proceeded as planned.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>90 INT. WORF'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Alexander is lying in his bed, exhausted from his<br>
    adventure, fast asleep. Worf stops at the bed to<br>
    check in on him. Satisfied, he turns to go. Alexander<br>
    opens his eyes and looks at Worf.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    Father...</p>
  <p> Worf stops, turns. Alexander looks a little gloomy.</p>
  <p> ALEXANDER<br>
    After what happened... I guess<br>
    you'll never want to go back to<br>
    the Ancient West...</p>
  <p> A beat. Worf speaks gently.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;A Fistful of Datas&quot; - REV. 9/17/92 - ACT FIVE 62.</p>
  <p>90 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The town of Deadwood may face<br>
    danger again, Alexander. If they<br>
    do... they'll need a Sheriff...<br>
    and a deputy.</p>
  <p> Alexander smiles at the words, and happily rolls over<br>
    to go back to sleep...</p>
  <p> Worf walks into the main room, stops at a table, and<br>
    reaches down and picks up his cowboy hat -- the same<br>
    one he's been wearing all along. He eyes it a moment,<br>
    then glances toward a nearby MIRROR...</p>
  <p> He puts on the hat and crosses to the mirror... strikes<br>
    a ready pose in front of it. Using his hand as an<br>
    imaginary gun, he draws and aims at his reflection.<br>
    Fast and smooth.</p>
  <p> OFF his face as he smiles...</p>
  <p>91 OMITTED</p>
  <p>92 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As the ship LEAVES ORBIT of the planet, a distant<br>
    ORANGE STAR comes into view. The Enterprise flies off<br>
    in the direction of the star, BACKLIT by the ORANGE<br>
    GLOW... like a sunset...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
