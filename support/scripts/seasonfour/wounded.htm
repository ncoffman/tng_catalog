    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> travelling through space.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log: Stardate 44429.6.<br>
    We are on a mapping survey near<br>
    the Cardassian sector. It has<br>
    been nearly a year since a peace<br>
    treaty ended the long conflict<br>
    between the Federation and<br>
    Cardassia.</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> PICARD, WORF, DATA, RIKER, TROI, SUPERNUMERARIES as<br>
    needed.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Captain, we are nearing the<br>
    periphery of Sector<br>
    twenty-one-five-oh-three.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Be on the lookout for a Cardassian<br>
    patrol vessel, Mister Worf.<br>
    They should be hailing us soon.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Even with a treaty, they're<br>
    skittish about protecting their<br>
    borders.</p>
  <p> Picard is on his feet, walks toward the viewscreen,<br>
    gazing at the field of stars.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Last time I was in this sector,<br>
    I was on the Stargazer, running<br>
    at warp speed ahead of a<br>
    Cardassian warship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (amused)<br>
    Running, Captain? You? That's<br>
    hard to believe...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Believe it. I'd been sent to make<br>
    preliminary overtures to a<br>
    truce... I lowered my shields as<br>
    a gesture of good will. But the<br>
    Cardassians weren't impressed.<br>
    They took out most of my weapons<br>
    and damaged the impulse engines<br>
    before I could regroup and run.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Cardassians have no honor.<br>
    I do not trust them.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    They're our allies now, Worf.<br>
    We have to trust them.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Trust is earned, not given away.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles wryly at his outspoken Security Officer.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, I hope their scout vessel<br>
    makes contact soon. It's not a<br>
    good idea to stay too long on a<br>
    Cardassian border without making<br>
    your intentions known.</p>
  <p>3 CLOSE ON A PLATE OF FOOD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which MATERIALIZES in the replicator -- largely<br>
    unrecognizable, of skimpy portions, and not<br>
    particularly appealing.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>4 INT. O'BRIEN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> O'Brien sits at a table, staring down at the plate of<br>
    food. Keiko is just bringing her own plate, sits and<br>
    joins him.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/23/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (re: food)<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Kelp buds... plankton loaf... and<br>
    sea berries.</p>
  <p> O'Brien stirs the food dispiritedly.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Sweetheart... I'm not a fish.</p>
  <p> She smiles brightly, unoffended.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's very healthy. I had this<br>
    for breakfast every morning when<br>
    I was growing up.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No oatmeal -- or muffins? How<br>
    about corned beef and eggs?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    For breakfast?</p>
  <p> She continues to eat heartily.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/23/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    Keiko, I've been thinking...<br>
    You've introduced me to all the<br>
    wonderful foods you're accustomed<br>
    to... I'd like to do the same.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Isn't that what marriage is about?<br>
    Sharing?</p>
  <p> She eyes him somewhat cautiously.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Like what kind of food?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Scalloped potatoes... mutton<br>
    shanks... oxtails and cabbage...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Kind of... heavy...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No, you'll love it, I promise.<br>
    (a deep breath)<br>
    I can still remember the aromas<br>
    when my mother was cooking...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    She cooked?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    She didn't believe in a<br>
    replicator. She thought real food<br>
    was more nutritious.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (with mild distaste)<br>
    She handled... real meat...<br>
    touched it and cut it?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Like a chef. She was fantastic.<br>
    Of course, I'll have to use the<br>
    replicator... but I'll make<br>
    something special for you tonight.<br>
    You'll love it, I promise.</p>
  <p> She smiles, swings her arms around his neck, pulls him<br>
    close.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Okay. Maybe I'll have something<br>
    special for you, tonight, too...</p>
  <p> She kisses him gently... then there is a muffled<br>
    explosion and a tremor in the room. Keiko pulls back,<br>
    startled. O'Brien gets to his feet, alert.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Something's wrong...</p>
  <p> COMPUTER VOICE<br>
    Red alert. Take emergency<br>
    stations.</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> under attack by a Cardassian warship.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Everyone on the Bridge at their stations and<br>
    functioning.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Cardassian ship preparing to fire<br>
    again, sir!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Increase power to forward shields!</p>
  <p> Another explosion jolts the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail them again, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is he doing? Damage report!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Minor damage to secondary hull<br>
    before we put our shields up, sir.<br>
    No casualties, structural<br>
    integrity intact.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI'S COM VOICE<br>
    Engineering to Bridge... starboard<br>
    power coupling is down...</p>
  <p> And another, bigger explosion rips at the reeling<br>
    Enterprise, causing the Bridge to shudder, lights play<br>
    off and on. In the midst of this chaos --</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>7 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CARDASSIAN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Cardassian ship firing on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p>8 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Still in upheaval.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Evasive action -- Delta Sequence.<br>
    Mister Worf, ready phasers.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Delta Evasion Plan initiated...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, limit targets to<br>
    engines and shields...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye sir... ready...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Fire.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CARDASSIAN SHIP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Phaser fire rips from the Enterprise toward the<br>
    Cardassian ship.</p>
  <p>10 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Direct hit, sir. Moderate damage<br>
    to their aft shield generators...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Continue phaser fire.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Multiple hits. Power failure<br>
    in forward shields...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Cardassian ship is standing down,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let's see if they'll answer our<br>
    hail now, Mister Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Frequency open, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (stepping forward)<br>
    This is Captain Jean-Luc Picard,<br>
    of the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>11 ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A Cardassian Gul (Captain) appears. These are humanoid<br>
    aliens -- sleek, handsome, intense.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    I am Gul Macet of the Cardassian<br>
    ship Trager.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why have you fired on us?</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    A curious question. In war, one<br>
    attacks one's enemies.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (perplexed)<br>
    There is a treaty between our<br>
    people...</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Perhaps that fact was unknown to<br>
    the Federation starship which<br>
    destroyed our space station in<br>
    the Cuellar System two days ago.</p>
  <p> Picard is taken aback -- this is news to him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A Federation starship... ?</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Attacked an unarmed science<br>
    station. They had barely enough<br>
    time to send an emergency<br>
    signal... before they were<br>
    incinerated.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gul Macet... the Federation and<br>
    the Cardassians have struggled<br>
    too hard for peace to abandon it<br>
    so easily...</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    We are not the ones who<br>
    abandoned it, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Let me talk to my superiors...<br>
    find out what's behind this.<br>
    Give me one hour. The alternative<br>
    is for us to continue firing at<br>
    each other. In such a contest,<br>
    you would be at a disadvantage.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Very well. One hour.</p>
  <p> His image is replaced with that of the ship. On<br>
    Picard's troubled expression....</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 OMITTED</p>
  <p>13 INT. READY ROOM - CLOSE ON MONITOR - INTERCUTTING<br>
    WITH PICARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> and the image of Admiral Haden.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    We've confirmed the report,<br>
    Captain. It was the starship<br>
    Phoenix... under the command of<br>
    Benjamin Maxwell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ben Maxwell... he's one of<br>
    Starfleet's finest Captains...<br>
    he must have had provocation.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    I wish we knew. He's gone on<br>
    silent running... doesn't answer<br>
    our communiques.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then he's still in Cardassian<br>
    space.</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    The station he destroyed was in<br>
    sector twenty-one-five-oh-five<br>
    -- you're the nearest starship.<br>
    We want you to go in and find<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Will the Cardassians<br>
    cooperate... ?</p>
  <p> ADMIRAL HADEN<br>
    They've granted you safe<br>
    passage... We've agreed that<br>
    you'll take along a delegation<br>
    of observers as a show of good<br>
    faith.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Jean-Luc... I don't have to tell<br>
    you the Federation is not prepared<br>
    for a new sustained conflict. You<br>
    must preserve the peace... no<br>
    matter what the cost. Haden out.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The screen goes blank and Picard sits for a moment,<br>
    reflecting on the precariousness of the situation.</p>
  <p>14 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND CARDASSIAN VESSEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> head-to-head.</p>
  <p>15 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER.</p>
  <p> Picard briefs the crew.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... there will be three Cardassians<br>
    transporting on board... Their<br>
    Captain, Gul Macet and two of his<br>
    aides.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    My intention is to be as open as<br>
    possible with them... allow them<br>
    to share in our search for the<br>
    Phoenix.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, it is necessary to assign<br>
    them a security detail.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    They will be our guests, Mister<br>
    Worf. I don't want them to feel<br>
    like prisoners.</p>
  <p> Worf is silent, but his look is eloquent.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm inclined to agree with Worf,<br>
    Captain. I would limit their<br>
    access while they're on board.<br>
    They don't need the run of the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> A minor rebellion here. Picard faces them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand your concerns. And<br>
    I realize... that we have had<br>
    a long and difficult history with<br>
    the Cardassians.</p>
  <p> He paces, formulating his thoughts.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    However... it is not an<br>
    exaggeration to say that the<br>
    difference between peace... and<br>
    war... is up to us. And the way<br>
    we treat the Cardassians may make<br>
    the difference.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    At least let me post guards at<br>
    some of the sensitive areas of<br>
    the ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (considers)<br>
    Very well, we will limit their<br>
    access. But instruct your<br>
    people... they are guests.</p>
  <p> He turns to Troi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor, stay close to the<br>
    crew. Some of them might be<br>
    uncomfortable with the Cardassians<br>
    on board. I want no incidents.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data, is there anyone on<br>
    board who served previously with<br>
    Captain Benjamin Maxwell?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Accessing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Chief O'Brien served under his<br>
    command aboard the Rutledge.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Mister Riker...<br>
    Counselor... you will greet our<br>
    guests in Transporter Room Three.<br>
    And advise Chief O'Brien that I<br>
    will be calling on him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (rising)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> He and Troi head for the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>16 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - MINUTES LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi ENTER; O'Brien is there.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The delegation is ready to come<br>
    aboard, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I believe you served under<br>
    Benjamin Maxwell?</p>
  <p> At the mention of this name, O'Brien brightens.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

    say I did.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It seems Maxwell has taken it<br>
    upon himself to destroy a<br>
    Cardassian space station.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is taken aback, but there is no flickering in<br>
    his loyalty.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    If that's true, sir, there was<br>
    a reason for it. I'd bank my life<br>
    on that.</p>
  <p> Riker and Troi both take note of the fervent defense.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Captain may want to talk to<br>
    you about him.<br>
    (re: Transport)<br>
    Bring them aboard.</p>
  <p> He manipulates his controls, there is the shimmering<br>
    EFFECT, and three Cardassians -- Gul Macet and two<br>
    aides -- MATERIALIZE on the pad. Riker steps forward<br>
    as they descend.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome to the Enterprise. I am<br>
    First Officer William Riker...<br>
    this is Counselor Deanna Troi.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    I am Gul Macet... my aides, Glinn<br>
    Daro and Glinn Telle.</p>
  <p> There are murmured greetings. Riker guides them toward<br>
    the door. The Cardassians see O'Brien, who cannot<br>
    entirely disguise his discomfort around his former<br>
    enemies.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Our Transporter Chief, Mister<br>
    O'Brien.</p>
  <p> The Cardassians nod politely. O'Brien inclines his<br>
    head only enough to have acknowledged them. He stares<br>
    straight ahead, not making eye contact. The others<br>
    start out the door.</p>

    eyes there is a look of strange and puzzling intensity.</p>
  <p>18 CLOSE ON TROI</p>
  <p> the last out the door, as she turns back to look at<br>
    O'Brien. She has seen his reaction to the Cardassians,<br>

    Cardassians.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    ... and with long-range sensors,<br>
    we've been scanning a radius of<br>
    ten light years. We can<br>
    effectively scan one sector in<br>
    a day.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We are scanning Sector<br>
    twenty-one-five-oh-five now. So<br>
    far... no sign of the Phoenix.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    (challenging)<br>
    In fact, you have no assurance<br>
    that the ship is still in Sector<br>
    twenty-one-five-oh-five.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (right back at him)<br>
    In fact, we don't have any idea<br>
    where it is. But the last known<br>
    co-ordinates seemed like a<br>
    reasonably good place to start.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> MACET<br>
    Captain Picard... you can<br>
    understand that we are skeptical.<br>
    Do you expect us to believe that<br>
    you are using every means at your<br>
    disposal -- to track down one of<br>
    your own?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Of course you would have concerns,<br>
    Gul Macet. It is precisely<br>
    because of that fact that I am<br>
    including you in every aspect of<br>
    our effort.<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    You are here, with my staff,<br>
    hearing reports as I hear them.<br>
    Nothing is edited... nothing<br>
    withheld.</p>
  <p> This is Picard at his most charming and persuasive. He<br>
    waves his hand toward Macet's chair.</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please. Let us continue.</p>
  <p> Macet hesitates a second, lest he appear too<br>
    acquiescent. Then --</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Very well.</p>
  <p> He sits.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our Transporter Chief, Mister<br>
    O'Brien, has served with Benjamin<br>
    Maxwell. I thought he might<br>
    provide some insights.</p>
  <p> All heads turn toward O'Brien.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister O'Brien... I believe<br>
    Captain Maxwell lost his family...<br>
    during a raid on an outpost.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    More like sabotage, sir. It was<br>
    on Setlik Three. A squad of<br>
    Cardassian militia made a sneak<br>
    attack on an outpost... wiped out<br>
    close to a hundred civilians.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Then it's vengeance he's after.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    That's not what I meant --</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Maxwell's taking retribution for<br>
    his own loss.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (half-rising)<br>
    Captain Maxwell would never --</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Gentlemen, please. Let us avoid<br>
    speculation, and confine this<br>
    discussion to facts. Now, Mister<br>
    O'Brien --</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Captain -- long range sensors have<br>
    located the Phoenix.</p>

  <p> Macet is already on his feet. Picard rises also.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> He and Picard EXIT toward the Bridge; the others,<br>
    toward the corridor.</p>
  <p>22 INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> O'Brien waits as a Turbolift door slides open, enters<br>

    silence, then --</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    Your Captain is most impressive.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is a little startled at being addressed.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Yes. He is.</p>
  <p> More silence.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    Chief O'Brien... our Transporting<br>
    system is still operating with<br>
    active feed pattern buffers. I<br>
    would like to talk with you about<br>
    your technology.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT TWO 21.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'll have to get Commander<br>
    La Forge's approval on that.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    I understand. In the meantime...<br>
    we're going to your Ten-Forward.<br>
    Will you join us?</p>
  <p> The Turbolift has arrived at Deck seventeen. O'Brien<br>
    starts for the door, turns back.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    If my commander tells me to<br>
    discuss the Transporter with you,<br>
    I will. If Captain Picard orders<br>
    me to tell you everything I know<br>
    about Ben Maxwell, I will.</p>
  <p> He moves closer, speaks with a quiet intensity.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    But who I choose to spend my free<br>
    time with... that's my business.</p>
  <p> He turns and steps off the Turbolift. The doors close,<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, set a course -- warp six.<br>
    Mister Worf, send a message by<br>
    sub-space. Tell them to prepare<br>
    to rendezvous with us.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT TWO 22.</p>
  <p>24 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Captain... a suggestion.</p>
  <p> Sensing something coming, Picard turns toward him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes?</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    We have a number of ships in<br>
    sector twenty-one-five-oh-five.<br>
    If you give us more precise<br>
    coordinates... and the ship's<br>
    coded transponder frequency...<br>
    we could intercept Maxwell much<br>
    more quickly than you.</p>
  <p> A barely perceptible pause.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure that's true. However,<br>
    given the circumstances, I'd<br>
    prefer to make the initial contact<br>
    myself. As I'm sure you would<br>
    if the situation were reversed.</p>
  <p> These are two shrewd masters of verbal fencing. Macet<br>
    makes one last exploratory thrust.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Time is crucial. You have a<br>
    dangerous man out there, with a<br>
    huge arsenal at his command. If<br>
    he's bent on revenge against my<br>
    people... he must be stopped<br>
    before he can do more damage.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    At the moment, we have an isolated<br>
    incident. If I reach him first,<br>
    diplomatic efforts can still<br>
    prevail.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But if one of your ships decides<br>
    to retaliate against the<br>
    Phoenix... we risk losing control<br>
    of the situation.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Then you won't give us the means<br>
    of finding his exact location?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT TWO 23.</p>

  <p> O'Brien, humming a little tune, carries a steaming<br>
    casserole from the replicator, puts it on the table,<br>
    where Keiko sits.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    There you are... potato casserole<br>
    -- a dish fit for kings.</p>
  <p> He turns back and gathers napkins, flatware, and a<br>
    candle. As Keiko inspects the casserole, he arranges<br>
    the table. He is still half-humming, half-singing<br>
    the song.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

  <p> Keiko looks up at him curiously.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    What's that you're singing?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    What? Oh... just an old song...</p>
  <p> He hadn't even realized he'd been singing. He tries<br>
    to explain.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    A bunch of us used to sing it<br>
    together... on the Rutledge.<br>
    I haven't thought about it for<br>
    years...</p>

    it back.</p>
  <p> He sits, starts slowly to eat. He's trying to figure a<br>
    way to bring something up... something he doesn't quite<br>
    feel comfortable discussing head on.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    You know... sitting with the<br>
    staff this morning, I could<br>
    tell there were people in that<br>
    room who still don't like the<br>
    Cardassians.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    I imagine that's to be expected...</p>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Capers. But the fighting is over<br>
    now. Why would anyone still<br>
    feel... however they feel?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Maybe it's not that easy for some<br>
    people to forget.</p>
  <p> She eyes him, knowing him well enough to know there's<br>
    more going on here than he's admitting to.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'm... trying to understand. The<br>
    people who hang onto -- grudges.<br>
    Seems to me they ought to be able<br>
    to put those feelings aside...<br>
    once the fighting's done with.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    That may be harder to do than to<br>
    say.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    You fought the Cardassians, didn't<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    There were some skirmishes... when<br>

  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Well... how do you feel about<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Phoenix is beginning evasive<br>
    maneuvers.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    It has positioned itself outside<br>
    the weapons range of the opposing<br>
    ship.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Phoenix has powered up with<br>
    both phasers and photon<br>
    torpedoes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    The Phoenix is firing photon<br>
    torpedoes.</p>
  <p> On the screen, the Phoenix has turned and is engaged<br>
    with the warship. The blips flutter a moment on the<br>
    screen... and then the Cardassian ship simply<br>
    disappears.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    (unbelieving)<br>
    He has destroyed our warship...</p>
  <p> There is a moment's silence as Picard's mind races.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Macet)<br>
    Does the supply ship carry any<br>
    weapons?</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Limited. Not enough to defeat<br>
    a Nebula Class Starship.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir...</p>
  <p> He looks up at the screen... as the smaller blip of<br>
    the supply ship flashes and then vanishes. The men<br>
    watching are grimly silent. Finally --</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    The warship carried a crew of six<br>
    hundred... the supply ship...<br>
    fifty...</p>
  <p> There is a silent, awful moment as they all absorb the<br>
    enormity of this act. Picard glances at Macet, mind<br>
    racing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Data... estimated time<br>
    until we intercept the Phoenix.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At our present speed of warp four,<br>
    sixteen hours, forty-four minutes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign, increase to warp nine.</p>
  <p> Gul Macet looks at him, overwhelmed by the events they<br>
    have just witnessed. Then he turns and strides toward<br>
    the Turbolift.</p>
  <p>35 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> O'Brien doing routine maintenance at his console. The<br>
    doors slide open and Picard ENTERS. O'Brien<br>
    straightens up, surprised.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Captain... ?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I wanted to... chat with you.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Anything I can do, sir, you know<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ben Maxwell must be quite a man.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    He's a rare one, all right.<br>
    (sincerely)<br>
    I count myself lucky, sir -- I've<br>
    served with the two finest<br>
    Captains in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Picard nods in acknowledgement of the compliment.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then... from your knowledge of<br>
    the man... what has gone wrong?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT THREE 32.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (vehemently)<br>
    There's a reason for what he's<br>
    doing. Those Cardassians were<br>
    up to something, I'm sure of it.</p>
  <p> Picard paces, searching for the questions that will<br>
    help him understand this rogue Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How did he take it... when his<br>
    family was killed?</p>
  <p> O'Brien pauses, considers. He clearly wants to present<br>
    Maxwell in the best light.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I'd say he took it well. Oh, I<br>
    know he was broken up inside...<br>
    who wouldn't be? But you'd never<br>
    know it to see him. He never<br>
    missed a minute's duty, always<br>
    had a smile and a joke...</p>
  <p> O'Brien says it as validation, but Picard hears<br>
    something rather more damning in this tale of the man<br>
    who never grieved.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    And Captain Maxwell, he'd never<br>
    retaliate out of vengeance, no<br>
    matter what that Cardassian says.<br>
    They're up to something...<br>
    they're the ones you should be<br>
    investigating, sir, not Captain<br>
    Maxwell.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You don't care for the<br>
    Cardassians...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I like them fine. It's just...<br>
    well, I know them. You learn to<br>
    watch your back around those<br>
    people.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT THREE 33.</p>
  <p>35 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Within the last hour... Benjamin<br>
    Maxwell has sent over six hundred<br>
    of them to their deaths.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is stunned.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I don't know what to say, sir...<br>
    he must've had his reasons...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think... when one has been angry<br>
    for a very long time... one gets<br>
    used to it. Then it becomes<br>
    comfortable... like old leather.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    And finally, it is so familiar<br>
    that one can hardly remember<br>
    feeling any other way.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    But in the long run, we are the<br>
    ones who are damaged by that kind<br>
    of anger. We are. Not them.</p>
  <p> Picard EXITS, and O'Brien is left with feelings stirred<br>
    and unresolved. Just whom was Picard talking about?</p>
  <p>36 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD - LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> O'Brien sits at the bar, nursing a synthetic beer.<br>
    Presently, the Cardassian, Daro, ENTERS, looks around,<br>
    sits at the bar at a remove from O'Brien.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    (to bartender)<br>
    Kanar?</p>
  <p> The bartender nods, retreats. O'Brien shifts his eyes<br>
    toward the Cardassian, catches him doing the same; both<br>
    look away. O'Brien takes a drink to finish off the<br>
    beer. He sets it down. He thinks.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/25/90 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Then he rises, moves toward the Cardassian.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Mind if I join you?</p>
  <p> Daro gestures toward the stool next to him. O'Brien<br>
    sits; the bartender brings Daro's drink.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    You want another?<br>
    (off O'Brien's nod)<br>
    And an ale.</p>
  <p> O'Brien is trying to find his opening gambit. Daro<br>
    drinks.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Kanar... never could develop a<br>
    taste for it.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    It takes some getting used to.</p>
  <p> Things ease a bit. O'Brien takes a breath. This isn't<br>
    easy.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I wanted to say... I... I owe you<br>
    an apology.</p>
  <p> Daro makes no response. O'Brien presses on, gingerly.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Shouldn't have... popped off like<br>
    that. In the Turbolift.</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    (carefully)<br>
    I think... this is hard on all<br>
    of us. I know I'll be happy when<br>
    I'm back on my own ship.</p>
  <p> O'Brien regards him. This hadn't occurred to him.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I guess that's true.<br>
    (simply)<br>
    I hadn't thought of it like that.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/23/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>36 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> The bartender arrives with O'Brien's beer and he takes<br>
    a swallow. Then a breath.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I was on Setlik Three.</p>
  <p> Daro looks at him, wary, not sure where this is going.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    With Captain Maxwell, the morning<br>
    after the massacre. We got there<br>
    too late, of course... almost<br>
    everyone was dead...</p>
  <p> DARO<br>
    (jumping in)<br>
    It was a terrible mistake... we<br>
    were told the outpost was to be<br>
    the launching place for a massive<br>
    attack against us...</p>
  <p> O'Brien stares into his beer, talking as though playing<br>
    a tape in his mind.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The only people left alive were<br>
    in an outlying district of the<br>
    settlement... I was sent there,<br>
    with a squad, to reinforce them.</p>
  <p> He seems to go into an almost dream-like state,<br>
    re-living the incident.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Cardassians were advancing on us,<br>
    moving through the streets,<br>
    destroying, killing... I was<br>
    with a group of women and children<br>
    when two Cardassian soldiers burst<br>
    in... I stunned the one, but the<br>
    other jumped me... we struggled...<br>
    one of the women threw me a phaser<br>
    and I fired...</p>
  <p> O'Brien takes a sip of beer.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The phaser was set at maximum.<br>
    The man just... incinerated...<br>
    there, before my eyes.<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN (Cont'd)<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'd never killed anything before.<br>
    When I was a kid I would worry<br>
    about having to swat a mosquito.</p>
  <p> O'Brien shoves his beer away, stands.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It's not you I hate, Cardassian.<br>
    I hate what I became... because<br>
    of you.</p>
  <p> He walks out, leaving Daro staring into his drink.</p>
  <p>37 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, and Macet. The Turbolift door<br>
    opens and Worf ENTERS, holding the Cardassian Glinn<br>
    Telle in a strong grip.</p>
  <p> TELLE<br>
    I will protest this, Klingon!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain Picard.</p>
  <p> Picard and Macet have risen, are staring at the two in<br>
    surprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, you may release the<br>
    man.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (letting go)<br>
    He was found at a computer station<br>
    on Deck thirty-five, attempting<br>
    to access information on our<br>
    weapon systems.</p>
  <p> TELLE<br>
    (to Macet)<br>
    A lie, Gul Macet. I was studying<br>
    the terminal interface systems...<br>
    they are more efficient than<br>
    ours. I have no idea what was in<br>
    the files.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT THREE 37.</p>
  <p>37 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    What business did you have going<br>
    near one of their computers?</p>
  <p> Telle is startled that his Captain does not support<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> TELLE<br>
    But... Gul Macet... I meant<br>
    nothing... there has been no harm<br>
    done.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    (grimly)<br>
    Go to your quarters. You are<br>
    confined there for the duration<br>
    of this expedition.</p>
  <p> A charged hesitation, and then Telle inclines his head.</p>
  <p> TELLE<br>
    As you wish, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister Worf, please accompany him.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Gladly.</p>
  <p> He leads the Cardassian into the Turbolift. Macet<br>
    turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Captain... may we speak in<br>
    private?</p>
  <p> Picard nods toward his Ready Room.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You have the Bridge, Number One.</p>
  <p>38 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Macet and Picard ENTER. Macet begins.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Captain, I deeply regret what<br>
    my aide has done. You have my<br>
    word that he will be<br>
    disciplined upon my return.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>38 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (conciliatory)<br>
    You may take whatever action<br>
    against him you feel is<br>
    appropriate. I consider the<br>
    matter closed.</p>
  <p> Macet studies Picard closely...</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    I'm not sure I would be so<br>
    generous in your place, Captain.<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    If there is to be a lasting peace,<br>
    Gul Macet, neither you nor I must<br>
    allow any one man to undermine<br>
    our efforts...</p>
  <p> A beat. Macet nods, understanding...</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    There have always been those who<br>
    crave war. Who need it.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I am not one of them, Captain.<br>
    I am beginning to see neither are<br>
    you. We have had our full measure.<br>
    The lasting peace begins here...<br>
    with the two of us.</p>
  <p> But before Picard can respond...</p>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Picard here.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have located the Phoenix,<br>
    Sir. We will intercept in<br>
    twenty-two minutes.</p>
  <p> Picard and Macet exchange looks. What the future<br>
    brings will surely depend on the unknown factor of<br>
    Captain Benjamin Maxwell.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT THREE </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/23/90 - ACT FOUR 40.</p>
  <p> ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>39 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND PHOENIX (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise with a slightly smaller, Nebula-class<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44431.7.<br>
    We have established communication<br>
    with Captain Maxwell, and he has<br>
    agreed to come on board.</p>
  <p>40 INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Riker and O'Brien wait as a figure MATERIALIZES on the<br>
    pad. Seconds later, CAPTAIN BENJAMIN MAXWELL steps<br>
    off. He is not at all what one might have expected.<br>
    Slight of build, short greying hair, chiseled, angular<br>
    face -- he could be Lenin. Or Lennon.</p>
  <p> But in the eyes there is warmth -- and humor. Creases<br>
    at the edges testify to a lifetime of smiles and<br>
    laughter. He is genuinely at ease with himself, and<br>
    consequently puts others at ease. Riker steps forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Welcome aboard, sir. I'm<br>
    Commander Riker, First Officer.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    I know all about you, Commander.<br>
    Fine work you did with the Borg.<br>
    We all owe you on that one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> Maxwell's eye falls on O'Brien, who stands to the side,<br>
    like a child awaiting the notice of a favorite uncle.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    O'Brien? Miles O'Brien?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Hello, Captain. Good to see you<br>
    again.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/23/90 - ACT FOUR 41.</p>
  <p>40 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Maxwell strides toward him, arm extended, shakes<br>
    O'Brien's hand, claps him on the shoulder. Maxwell's<br>
    smile is so ingenuous that he seems like a neighbor<br>
    hanging over the back fence.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    How are you? I had no idea you<br>
    were on the Enterprise.<br>
    (turning, to Riker)<br>
    This was my Tactical Officer on<br>
    the Rutledge. Best I ever had.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    O'Brien has the ability to size<br>
    up a situation instantly, then<br>
    come up with options to fit all<br>
    contingencies. Remarkable.</p>
  <p> The specificity of the compliment gives it impact.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    If that's true, I learned it from<br>
    you, sir.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    (grins)<br>
    But you got that silver tongue<br>
    by kissing the stone, right?<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Well, Commander. Best I see your<br>
    Captain straight away. We have<br>
    a lot to talk about.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> Riker leads him out. O'Brien looks after them, a play<br>
    of emotions on his face. Is this revered man a saint<br>
    or a sinner? Or some of both?</p>
  <p>41 INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> as the Turbolift opens and Maxwell walks out, followed<br>
    by Riker. His entrance electrifies everyone on the<br>
    Bridge.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    What a sweet ship this is... I'll<br>
    admit, I've always wanted a Galaxy<br>
    class vessel...</p>
  <p> He comes face to face with Gul Macet, who stands<br>
    straight, steely, looking him in the eye.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain... Gul Macet. He and his<br>
    aides are guests on the ship.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> Neither man offers his hand. The warmth is gone from<br>
    Maxwell's eyes. There is a silence before Riker steps<br>
    in again.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain Picard is waiting in his<br>
    Ready Room. This way.</p>
  <p> He gestures, leads toward the Ready Room. Maxwell<br>
    turns, and Gul Macet follows him with his eyes until<br>
    he is gone.</p>
  <p>42 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain Picard... Captain Benjamin<br>
    Maxwell.</p>
  <p> Picard rises, extends his hand. Each man is appraising<br>
    the other, swiftly and carefully.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Captain...</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    A pleasure. I've heard about<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> Picard makes no effort to return Maxwell's bonhomie.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Sit down, please.<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    That will be all, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker EXITS. Maxwell looks up at Picard, smiling<br>
    easily.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    You must think I've gone mad.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The thought has occurred.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    Picard, I have to tell you... I<br>
    was grateful when I realized it<br>
    was you Starfleet sent after me.<br>
    Somebody who knows what it's<br>
    really like out here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I know of nothing out here that<br>
    could justify what you've done.</p>
  <p> Maxwell presses his fingers together like a professor<br>
    calmly explaining a difficult theorem to a student.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    Then listen to this -- the<br>
    Cardassians are arming again.<br>
    That so-called science station?<br>
    A military supply port.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How do you know this?</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    Information comes my way.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    From whom? Where is your<br>
    documentation?</p>
  <p> Maxwell flashes him a look; he doesn't like being<br>
    challenged.</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    You know how these things work...<br>
    you see things, you hear things...<br>
    you add them up and you know damn<br>
    well what's going on.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In other words, you have no<br>
    documentation...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Wounded&quot; - REV. 10/29/90 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    I know what they're doing. I can<br>
    smell it. There's no good reason<br>
    for a science station in the<br>
    Cuellar System... but it's a hell<br>
    of a strategic site for a<br>
    military transport station... a<br>
    jumping off point into three<br>
    Federation sectors. They're<br>
    running supply ships back and<br>
    forth... and nobody's gonna tell<br>
    me it's for scientific research...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Whatever circumstances you<br>
    believed you encountered, why<br>
    didn't you notify Starfleet?</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    And wait six months while the<br>
    bureaucrats sit around reading<br>
    reports, trying to figure out what<br>
    to do? They don't know what's<br>
    going on out here... but you<br>
    should, Picard, you know what it's<br>
    like to be under fire...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    You have killed nearly seven<br>

    brink of war...</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    I have prevented war... or at the<br>
    very least delayed it a good long<br>
    time. The peace treaty was a<br>
    ruse, to give them breathing room,<br>
    time to regroup...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And so you alone simply decided<br>
    to dispose of the treaty...</p>

    Maxwell?<br>

    Why does a man with your long,<br>
    brilliant service suddenly abandon<br>
    the fundamental principles that<br>
    he has believed in, even fought<br>
    for, all his life... ? I'll tell<br>
    you what I believe... it was<br>
    because of what they did to your<br>
    wife... and your children...</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    ... Not true. Not true...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    ... to avenge their deaths.</p>
  <p> Maxwell is wounded, frustrated, realizing he cannot<br>
    win this confrontation...</p>
  <p> MAXWELL<br>
    You're a fool, Picard. History<br>
    will look at you and say 'this<br>
    man was a fool'.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    We served together a long time...<br>

  <p> Picard hesitates, considering it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He'll never drop his shields to<br>
    let you transport on board.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The Phoenix is using a high-energy<br>
    sensor sweep. It cycles every<br>
    five-point-five minutes. Between<br>
    those cycles there's a window of<br>
    a fiftieth of a second.<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    It's good we're trying this with<br>
    another Federation ship. It would<br>
    never work with an alien vessel.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm not so sure it's going to work<br>
    this time. Can you get an<br>
    accurate enough fix on his shield<br>
    modulation to get through?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I think so. The Phoenix should<br>
    be following standard Starfleet<br>
    protocols. They have to align<br>
    their shields at the start of<br>
    every sweep.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So you'll sync up the beam...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    And slip right through...</p>
  <p> He holds up both hands... slips the fingers of his left<br>
    hand through the separated fingers of his right.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But if there's any phase error...<br>
    you could materialize outside the<br>
    ship... we'd never have a chance<br>
    to correct.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    I've been monitoring his sweep<br>
    patterns... I'm telling you, I<br>
    can compensate...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And I guess we could increase the<br>
    pattern buffer cycle to give us<br>
    a little more margin for error...</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The current cycle is almost<br>
    finished, sir... they'll be phase<br>
    aligning in twenty seconds...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    The loyalty you would so quickly<br>

    my people, Gul Macet. You have<br>
    much to learn about us. Benjamin<br>
    Maxwell earned the loyalty of<br>
    those who served with him. In<br>
    war, he was twice honored with<br>
    the Federation's highest citation<br>

    if he could not find a role for<br>
    himself in peace, we can pity him,<br>

    that ship... I am quite certain<br>
    that you and I would not be<br>
    sitting here now. And that ships<br>
    on both sides would be arming for<br>
    war.</p>
  <p> MACET<br>
    Captain, I assure you...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Take a message to your leaders,<br>
    Gul Macet. We know. We'll be<br>
    watching. We'll be ready.</p>
