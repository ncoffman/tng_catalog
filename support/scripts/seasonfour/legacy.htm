  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>A1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Travelling at standard warp.</p>
  <p>B1 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA, TROI and WORF are playing five-card draw<br>
    poker, Riker dealing. Riker and Data have similarly<br>
    large piles of chips in front of them. It looks like<br>
    Troi and Worf are down to mortgaging the farm. Worf<br>
    stares at his hand -- his poker face leaves a lot to<br>
    be desired.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (scowls)<br>
    One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (baiting him)<br>
    Worf. Are you trying to fill<br>
    another inside straight?</p>
  <p> Worf grunts.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
  <p> Riker deals him a card. Worf takes a look and folds.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Pah.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    I fold.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/24/90 - TEASER 1A.</p>
  <p>B1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker looks at Data, who carefully adds two chips,<br>
    followed by three more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will raise you three.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    No cards?</p>
  <p> Riker reacts as Data answers with an utterly unreadable<br>
    look.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to others)<br>
    Best poker face I've ever seen.</p>
  <p> Riker stares at Data for a beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dealer takes two.</p>
  <p> Riker deals himself two cards. Stares at them for a<br>
    moment. Adds five chips to the pile. Then five more.<br>
    He looks at Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Raise you ten.</p>
  <p> Without hesitation, Data counts out ten chips, then<br>
    twenty more.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I will see your bet, and raise<br>
    you twenty.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data. Are you sitting on a full<br>
    house or a flush?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It will cost you twenty to make<br>
    that determination, Sir.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER 1B.</p>
  <p>B1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Riker stares at him for a few beats. Smiles and tosses<br>
    in his cards.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Dealer folds.</p>
  <p> Data calmly pulls in the chips. Both Troi and Worf<br>
    push back from the table -- finished for the night.<br>
    Troi looks at the chips in front of Riker and Data,<br>
    now even more evenly matched.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (teasingly)<br>
    You two have successfully split<br>
    the evening between yourselves.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I suspect conspiracy. But far<br>
    be it for me to accuse my superior<br>
    officers.</p>
  <p> Riker laughs. Looks at Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's getting harder to bluff you,<br>
    Data. You've learned this game<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir, I believe I have.</p>
  <p> Riker reshuffles the deck of cards, considering Data<br>
    as he does so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Tell you what.</p>
  <p> He fans out the cards on the table. Troi and Worf<br>
    stick around to see what he's up to, as Riker pushes<br>
    his entire pile of winnings towards Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I'll bet you I can find a card<br>
    that you bury anywhere in this<br>
    deck. And furthermore, I'll make<br>
    you help me do it.</p>
  <p> Data considers the challenge for a moment.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER 1C.</p>
  <p>B1 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Careful, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your guidance is much valued,<br>
    Counsellor. However...</p>
  <p> Data pushes his chips into the betting pot. Troi<br>
    laughs. Data selects a card.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't let me see it.</p>
  <p> Data pulls it up towards his face. Troi and Worf<br>
    adjust their positions to be behind Data, so that they<br>
    too can see the card.</p>
  <p>C1 CLOSE UP THE CARD</p>
  <p> The Jack of Hearts.</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Now lose it in the deck.</p>
  <p>D1 RESUME</p>
  <p> Data does so, and Riker quickly shuffles and plops the<br>
    deck right down in front of Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Cut the deck into two halves.</p>
  <p> Data does so, making two halves. Riker takes one half<br>
    away, discarding it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Again.</p>
  <p> Data again makes two halves with what's left. Riker<br>
    again takes one away.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Once more.</p>
  <p> Same procedure.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER 1D.</p>
  <p>D1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    How many cards are left?</p>
  <p> Data fans them slightly, counting as he does so.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Eleven.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Pick five.</p>
  <p> Data does so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Throw them away.</p>
  <p> Data puts them aside. Six remain in front of them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Choose three.</p>
  <p> Data does so.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now pick one of those.</p>
  <p> Data picks one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Turn it over.</p>
  <p> Data does so -- it is the Jack of Hearts. Troi and<br>
    Worf appear astonished.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (knowing the answer)<br>
    Is that your card?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Incredible.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles and moves to pull the large pile of chips<br>
    towards his side of the table.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - TEASER 1E.</p>
  <p>D1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You surreptitiously placed the<br>
    edge of your left thumb onto the<br>
    card immediately after I inserted<br>
    it back into the deck. When you<br>
    divided the deck to reshuffle,<br>
    you kept that card on top. You<br>
    thus were able to have me either<br>
    discard or save depending on the<br>
    card's location, which you<br>
    followed at each step. Until we<br>
    were left with one -- the card<br>
    I originally chose.</p>
  <p> Riker scowls, beaten. Data reaches his arms out and<br>
    starts pulling the pile of chips towards his side.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I think under the<br>
    circumstances...</p>

    distress call from a Federation<br>

    Subspace message from the Arcos.<br>
    Their transmitter is failing, sir.<br>

    Let's hear it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/28/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf touches a control and the voice of crewman TAN TSU<br>
    is heard on audio, fuzzing in and out of a rough<br>
    transmission.</p>
  <p> TAN TSU'S VOICE<br>
    Enterprise, this is Tan Tsu, Arcos<br>
    engineer. Estimate five minutes<br>
    till warp drive containment<br>
    breach.</p>
  <p> A small explosion can be heard in the background,<br>
    momentarily disrupting the audio. It returns with even<br>
    less quality than before.</p>
  <p> TAN TSU'S VOICE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Make that three minutes. Thanks<br>
    for trying, Enterprise...</p>

    an Earth colony that severed<br>

    concerned about sending an away<br>

  <p> of a bombed-out 24th century version of the South<br>
    Bronx.</p>
  <p>12 INT. ENTRANCE TO TUNNEL</p>
  <p> A wide, partially fallen-in tunnel. The away team<br>
    ENTERS cautiously from outside, phasers ready. Data is<br>
    reading his tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The dispersion trail continues<br>
    in this direction.</p>
  <p> He stops to double-check his readings. Then turns<br>
    slightly with the tricorder, pointing with it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The concentration gradient<br>
    definitely increases along this<br>
    vector.</p>
  <p> He indicates a direction.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The escape pod was apparently<br>
    moved into the tunnels ahead of<br>
    us.</p>
  <p> WORKMEN walk by carrying several cannisters. They give<br>
    the away team half-a-look, avoid them, and go on with<br>
    their business. Several CIVILIAN-LOOKING INDIVIDUALS<br>
    approach from the other direction, again giving the<br>
    away team a wide berth and attempting no contact. It<br>
    suggests a city street. Pedestrian traffic.</p>
  <p> The Federation officers seem surprised, and lower their<br>
    phasers. Riker glances towards Worf.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Not the response we expected.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Maybe things have changed here.</p>
  <p> Suddenly, all hell breaks loose around them. Alarms go<br>
    off; the three workmen dive for cover; FOUR COALITION<br>
    MEN and ONE COALITION WOMAN in their early to<br>
    mid-twenties come hurrying around a corner.</p>
  <p> One is carrying a small crate in his arms, one of the<br>
    others has a phaser, the remaining three carry<br>
    nightstick-looking devices. The garments worn by three<br>
    of them are torn in several places, as if in a fight<br>
    that just happened. One of the men looks seriously<br>
    injured, though still on his feet and moving; his shirt<br>
    is torn across his chest. In the flurry of activity,<br>
    we may notice a diamond-shaped bright orange/yellow<br>
    solid glow, about an inch in diameter, on a spot under<br>
    their garments just below the collar bone.</p>
  <p> They stop dead in their tracks, completely surprised at<br>
    the sight of the away team directly in front of them,<br>
    phasers now raised. The newcomers assume a ready<br>
    stance with their weapons. The injured man slumps to<br>
    his knees. Beverly goes to assist. She begins to<br>
    examine the wounds.</p>
  <p> MAN #1<br>
    Identify yourselves.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're from the Federation Starship<br>
    Enterprise. We tracked two<br>
    crewmen to this area. Do you know<br>
    anything about them?</p>
  <p> MAN #1<br>
    Possibly.</p>
  <p> The others in his group are glancing anxiously around.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What do you mean?</p>
  <p> MAN #1<br>
    It depends on what you have to<br>
    offer in return.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/24/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>12A<br>
    thru OMITTED<br>
    12B</p>
  <p>12C ANGLE ON THE WOUNDED MAN</p>
  <p> as his diamond-shaped orange/yellow glow suddenly<br>
    pulses beneath the skin -- right where his shirt has<br>
    been ripped open. Almost as one body, the group<br>
    suddenly turn towards a corridor opening. The other<br>
    Coalition members are pulsing as well.</p>
  <p> MAN #1<br>
    They found us.</p>
  <p>12D RIKER AND WORF</p>
  <p> react to the pulsing, glance at each other.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (to Riker, re: the glow)<br>
    Proximity detectors. I've seen<br>
    them used on Manu Three.</p>
  <p> A beat later we hear shouting and a couple of phasers<br>
    firing from the corridor.</p>
  <p> MAN #1<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Follow me.</p>
  <p> He and his group take off down an opposite corridor.<br>
    Riker pauses for a moment, makes a decision.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come on.</p>
  <p> The away team follows quickly after them.</p>
  <p> (NOTE: re the detectors: whenever a gang member is in<br>
    foreign territory, it glows. When an enemy begins to<br>
    approach, it pulses.)</p>
  <p>13 INT. TUNNEL INTERSECTION (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A spare, meeting ground area, with a few crates serving<br>
    as objects to sit on or lean against -- a very casual<br>
    guerrilla look.</p>
  <p> HAYNE, late-twenties, tough, charming and charismatic,<br>
    is checking out the contents of the box his men just<br>
    stole.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/23/90 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The away team stands in front of him, surrounded in<br>
    the background by several male and female Coalition<br>
    members who don't appear particularly threatened by<br>
    their appearance. Since the members are back in their<br>
    own territory, the orange/yellow glows are no longer<br>
    activated, and are therefore invisible. Man #1 is<br>
    near Hayne.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    The Alliance is holding your men<br>
    hostage, Commander Riker, not<br>
    us. You can expect a ransom<br>
    demand...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    The Alliance?</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    Our good friends.</p>
  <p> Some of his comrades give a low laugh. Hayne pulls<br>
    out of the box a bottle of what looks like liquor.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (to his gang)<br>
    Our &quot;good friends&quot; are going to<br>
    be upset when they realize we took<br>
    their last crate of Telluridan<br>
    synthale.</p>
  <p> More laughter. Riker looks impatient.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Maybe it would be easier if I<br>
    contacted the authorities.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (flash of anger)<br>
    We are the &quot;authorities.&quot;</p>
  <p> Hayne quickly recovers his cool. Sets down the bottle<br>
    and picks up one of the nightstick weapons, called a<br>
    STUNSTICK, pointing it at a schematic wall-hanging of<br>
    the city below the ground. The city is shaped like a<br>
    sunken pyramid with the base at the lowest depth.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The Coalition -- our cadre -- runs<br>
    this side of the city. The<br>
    Alliance controls the other. Take<br>
    your choice.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Are you offering to help?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    In return for some...<br>
    consideration. Phasers are in<br>
    short supply down here. A<br>
    starship isn't going to miss a<br>
    few.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts with distrust.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is no better than a ransom<br>
    demand.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    No matter what you give the<br>
    Alliance, they'll eventually kill<br>
    your crewmen anyway. With our<br>
    help there's at least a chance<br>
    you'll get them back alive.</p>
  <p> A beat. Hayne senses their hesitation.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    All we're asking for is help in<br>
    maintaining our defense. We're<br>
    trying to keep the peace.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at the stolen crate, looks doubtful.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Everything we've seen suggests<br>
    otherwise.</p>
  <p> Hayne indicates the crate with a dismissive gesture.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    A prank. The proximity implants<br>
    prevent either side from doing<br>
    any serious damage.</p>
  <p> Hayne taps the spot just below the center of his collar<br>
    bone. Then he indicates the map.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    They warn us when an enemy is<br>
    approaching.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Then why do you need more phasers?</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    The Alliance just discovered a<br>
    large cache of weapons. I just<br>
    want to make things even.<br>
    Preserve the peace.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You keep using the word &quot;peace.&quot;<br>
    We've heard a different version<br>
    of life on Turkana Four.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (bristling)<br>
    Ancient history.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Where did you hear that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A former crewmember was born here.</p>
  <p> Hayne considers that for a moment.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    Where's he now?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She was killed in the line of<br>
    duty.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (shrugs)<br>
    That's as good a way to die as<br>
    any.</p>
  <p> Hayne has inadvertently hit a nerve, but Riker does<br>
    his best to hide it.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    As I said -- ancient history.<br>
    This is now. And your men are<br>
    in trouble.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/23/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>13 CONTINUED: (5)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We'll return to the Enterprise<br>
    and consider your proposal.</p>
  <p> Hayne nods his acceptance. Then steps over and hands<br>
    the bottle of synthale to Riker.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    A gift for your Captain.</p>
  <p> Data quickly scans it with the tricorder, finding<br>
    nothing amiss. Riker touches his insignia.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Riker to Enterprise. Energize.</p>
  <p> The away team DISAPPEARS into the transporter beam.<br>
    When they're gone, Hayne turns to his second-in-<br>
    command.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    I want everything there is to<br>
    know about the starship<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p>14 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is examining the bottle from the colony; the<br>
    away team is back and standing nearby. Bridge crew<br>
    consists of Riker, Data, Worf, Beverly, Troi, and a<br>
    supernumerary at the Conn.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (re: the bottle)<br>
    According to Hayne, the Coalition<br>
    and the Alliance raid each other<br>
    for supplies -- much of it<br>
    non-essential.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    A battle exercise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Their defenses apparently prevent<br>
    deep strikes into each other's<br>
    territory. Minor skirmishes are<br>
    all that's left.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT ONE 14.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    &quot;Coalition&quot;, &quot;Alliance&quot; -- it all<br>
    sounds so reasonable. But you've<br>
    described the behavior of urban<br>
    street thugs. We certainly won't<br>
    trade weapons for the crewmen.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    How do you suggest we deal with<br>
    them?</p>
  <p> Picard sets down the bottle.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We have to tell them something.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No promises. No denials.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods in agreement)<br>
    For now, Hayne's Coalition is our<br>
    only safe access to the colony.<br>
    Let's keep the door open and see<br>
    where it leads.</p>
  <p> Worf glances down at his instrument panel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain. Transmission from<br>
    Turkana Four. Coming in on a<br>
    secure channel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>15 INSERT VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A close shot of Hayne in the same location. A young<br>
    woman, ISHARA, is standing next to and slightly behind<br>
    him. She is early to mid-twenties, blonde, slender,<br>
    athletic and attractive.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/23/90 - ACT ONE 15.</p>
  <p>15 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    Hello, Enterprise. Commander<br>
    Riker, would you introduce me to<br>
    your Captain?</p>
  <p>16 INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Picard, then toward the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Hayne)<br>
    I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard.</p>
  <p>17 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Hayne nods acknowledgement -- as one equal to another.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    I have someone here you might like<br>
    to meet.</p>
  <p> Ishara steps forward.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is Ishara... Ishara Yar.</p>
  <p> A beat as Ishara stares straight out from the<br>
    viewscreen.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Tasha was my sister.</p>
  <p> OFF the Bridge crew's stunned reaction.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>

  <p>19 ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAAL)</p>
  <p> Hayne and Ishara looking at the crew.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    There's an old saying, Captain.<br>
    &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my<br>
    friend.&quot; I've decided it's in<br>
    my best interest to help you get<br>
    your men back.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    With nothing from us in return?</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    You could be forced into paying<br>
    my adversary a ransom in weapons.<br>
    I'll do anything I can to avoid<br>
    that possibility.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What do you propose?</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (indicating Ishara)<br>
    Ishara will be our liaison.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    I know Alliance territory. I can<br>
    help you with a rescue plan.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    One moment.</p>
  <p> Picard signals Worf to mute the channel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Mute.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT TWO 17.</p>
  <p>20 RESUME BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As Picard turns to his officers.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reactions?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    I do not trust him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    She could be a fake. We mentioned<br>
    that a former member of the crew<br>
    had come from the colony.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    All Hayne had to do was search<br>
    through whatever their database<br>
    had on Starfleet to come up with<br>
    Tasha's name.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counsellor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's being deceptive, and he's<br>
    clearly hoping to manipulate us.<br>
    As for the young woman's identity,<br>
    I can't tell.</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a moment, makes a decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Regardless, this is an option we<br>
    cannot neglect. We'll continue<br>
    on other fronts as they present<br>
    themselves. For now, let's see<br>
    what she has to say.</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Worf, who touches his panel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>

  <p>21 INSERT VIEWSCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Hayne and Ishara.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I've decided to accept your<br>
    proposal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/24/90 - ACT TWO 17A.</p>
  <p>21 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    Thank you.</p>
  <p> He glances from Ishara back to Picard.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Good luck.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's stone serious face.</p>

  <p>22 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> CLOSE ON Ishara, MATERIALIZING on the transporter pad.</p>
  <p> Data is waiting for her when she steps off. She takes<br>
    note of his appearance.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Welcome to the Enterprise, Ishara.<br>
    I am Commander Data.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You're not human.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am an android.</p>
  <p> Ishara glances at him.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Built for fighting... ?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reacts)<br>
    On what do you base that<br>
    assumption?</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    A cybernetic device serving on<br>
    a starship...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Enterprise is not a ship of<br>
    war. It is a ship of<br>
    exploration.</p>
  <p> This doesn't particularly intrigue her -- in fact, she<br>
    seems on the whole somewhat emotionally disconnected.<br>
    NOT HARSH -- just missing something. Though there is<br>
    an undercurrent of woundedness or vulnerability beneath<br>
    it all that she does her best to hide.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    The first thing to do is help you<br>
    map the colony.<br>
    (takes out chip)<br>
    This is a general grid of the<br>
    tunnel systems. I can fill in<br>
    the specific details from memory.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/30/90 - ACT TWO 18A.</p>
  <p>22 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My orders are to escort you to<br>
    the Observation Lounge. We will<br>
    proceed from there.</p>
  <p> She nods assent, and they head for the door.</p>
  <p>23 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Ishara are walking away from the transporter<br>
    room.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your sister never spoke of you.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    That's not surprising.</p>
  <p> Data glances at her.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/24/90 - ACT TWO 19.</p>
  <p>23 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is surprising to me. Tasha<br>
    and I spent much time together<br>
    in the course of our duties. We<br>
    had a considerable number of<br>
    conversations.</p>
  <p> Ishara studies him for a moment.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Did she talk at all about the<br>
    colony?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Only to say that she was lucky<br>
    to have escaped.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (matter of factly)<br>
    It wasn't luck. It was cowardice.</p>
  <p> Data looks surprised.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    &quot;Cowardice&quot; is a term that I have<br>
    never heard applied to Tasha.</p>
  <p> She glances at him -- a shift of the head and a look<br>
    in her eyes that Data seems to recognize. She picks<br>
    up on it.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Is something wrong?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No. It is just that for a<br>
    moment, the expression on your<br>
    face was reminiscent of your<br>
    sister.</p>
  <p> This seems to strike a place of vulnerability in her,<br>
    but she covers it immediately, turning away from him,<br>
    and speaking in her even, unemotional tone.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    It's been fifteen years. I don't<br>
    even remember what she looked<br>
    like...</p>
  <p>24 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE</p>

  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/24/90 - ACT TWO 20.</p>
  <p>24A ANGLE ON THE SENIOR STAFF</p>
  <p> Waiting in the room. Picard, Riker, Troi, Geordi,<br>
    Beverly. They can't help but stare at her for a couple<br>
    of silent beats -- almost as if looking for some sign<br>
    of Tasha.</p>
  <p>24B RESUME</p>
  <p> Ishara reacts to their gaze.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You don't believe I'm Tasha's<br>
    sister.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have considered that<br>
    possibility.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    I'm not surprised. You can<br>
    sample my DNA if you like.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Thank you, I will.</p>
  <p> Picard indicates a chair.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please. Sit down.</p>
  <p> Ishara takes a seat, Data does the same. Troi studies<br>
    her carefully, trying to get a sense of her.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Perhaps it would help if you gave<br>
    us some idea of what we're dealing<br>
    with on Turkana Four. Our last<br>
    information describes a colony<br>
    in complete disarray.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    It started falling apart almost<br>
    thirty years ago. There were<br>
    dozens of factions. They fought<br>
    until the city above ground was<br>
    in ruins.</p>

    We were the two strongest<br>
    factions... When the government<br>
    couldn't stop the violence, they<br>
    gave us police powers. The<br>
    proximity detectors were<br>
    originally designed by the<br>
    government to keep us under<br>
    control.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Apparently, that part of the plan<br>
    didn't succeed very well.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    No. After a few months, we<br>
    didn't need the government any<br>
    more.</p>

    Tasha left you in the middle of<br>
    all that?</p>
  <p> A beat. Ishara's voice grows quieter.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    She didn't abandon me, if that's<br>
    what you mean. Tasha asked me<br>
    to go with her. But I had<br>
    already joined the Coalition.<br>
    They were my family.</p>
  <p> The group reacts to her admission. She looks at<br>
    Picard, voice still quiet, doing her best to hide her<br>
    difficulty with this subject.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing, to Picard)<br>
    Captain, we don't have a lot of<br>

    Take that threat seriously,<br>
    Captain. They'll torture them<br>
    and then they'll kill them. My<br>
    cadre has never recovered a<br>
    hostage alive from the Alliance.</p>
  <p> She has everyone's attention.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Your crewmen could be held in any<br>
    number of places. The Alliance<br>
    has two main headquarters and<br>
    thirteen ancillary bases of<br>
    operation. All underground. All<br>

    What's that?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A sensing device on the escape<br>
    pod. It monitors the bio-electric<br>
    signatures of the crew. In the<br>
    event they get separated from the<br>
    pod.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I could install a booster on the<br>
    device that would relay its<br>
    signals to the Enterprise. Then<br>
    we could track the men from up<br>

  <p> Riker, Data, Geordi, Worf and Ishara gathered around<br>

    Don't underestimate them,<br>
    Commander. They'll be ready for<br>
    that... I've seen them use this<br>
    kind of strategy before.</p>
  <p> Riker gives her a questioning look.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I know it looks isolated and<br>
    easily accessible... But my guess<br>
    is they have hundreds of men on<br>
    the levels above and below<br>
    waiting for you to make your<br>
    move.</p>

    We'll need a diversion.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Transport a couple of photon<br>
    grenades into the adjoining<br>
    chambers. At minimum intensity<br>
    it wouldn't kill anybody, just<br>
    shake them up a lot.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That won't give us enough time.<br>
    We need something that'll occupy<br>
    them long enough for you to<br>
    install the relay.</p>
  <p> A beat. Ishara indicates the map.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Transport me into this corridor.<br>
    My magnetic implant will set off<br>
    the defense alarms. They'll<br>
    think it's a raid by the<br>
    Coalition.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Too dangerous. We've seen what<br>
    those tunnels look like. You<br>
    could easily be cut off from the<br>

  <p> Riker can't help but be impressed by her courage --<br>
    but he's still hesitant.</p>

    I want to discuss this with the<br>

    Mister Data, take Ishara to see<br>

  <p> Ishara nods her assent.</p>
  <p>28A INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Ishara is sitting on a diagnostic bed as Beverly slowly<br>
    brushes an instrument over the inside of the young<br>
    woman's arm. (NOTE: The instrument does touch the<br>
    skin) Data is standing nearby.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You have Tasha's DNA on file?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    The ship's computer does.<br>
    (re: Ishara's arm)<br>
    There's always some<br>
    differentiation in the somatic<br>
    chromosomes -- but it's not enough<br>
    to affect the results.</p>
  <p> Beverly finishes with the instrument.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    It'll take me a few hours to run<br>
    the isomorphic comparison.</p>
  <p> Dr. Crusher steps away, heading towards the lab.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    That wasn't too bad.</p>

    So, all that's left of my sister<br>
    is a file in a computer...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Tasha exists in our memories as<br>
    well.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    How did she die?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Lieutenant Yar was killed on Vagra<br>
    Two by a malevolent entity.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    In battle?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No... she was killed as a<br>
    demonstration of the creature's<br>
    power. Without provocation.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (sad laugh)<br>
    That's not how I intend to die.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Riker ENTERS.</p>

  <p> Off her reaction.</p>
  <p>29 INT. CHAMBER - ESCAPE POD</p>
  <p> A half-fallen down tunnel area similar to what the away<br>

  <p> A beat on a silent, deserted tunnel. Ishara suddenly<br>
    MATERIALIZES, phaser drawn. As soon as the Transporter<br>
    beam clears, the implant beneath her collar bone begins<br>
    to glow its characteristic bright orange/yellow.<br>
    Simultaneously, a piercing alarm goes off in the tunnel<br>
    around her.</p>
  <p>29C INT. CHAMBER - ESCAPE POD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Alliance guards at the pod appear dumbfounded at<br>
    the alarm wailing distantly offscreen. It is followed<br>
    by a second. And a third.</p>
  <p> Three more Alliance members come running in from<br>
    adjoining tunnels, confused about what's happening.</p>
  <p> The female guard motions to them to follow her, and<br>
    they all run toward the alarms, weapons ready, leaving<br>
    the two male guards behind at the pod.</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and Worf simultaneously come out from<br>
    behind a slight wall and stun the two remaining men.<br>
    Geordi steps out carrying a toolkit-sized box of<br>
    equipment.</p>
  <p> They all head straight for the escape pod. When they<br>
    get there, Riker, Data, and Worf stand guard as Geordi<br>
    reaches underneath with the equipment.</p>
  <p>30 INT. ADJOINING CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Alarms are blaring. Ishara moves around a projection,<br>

  <p> She turns slightly to her left, sensing something as<br>
    the orange/yellow diamond glow below her collar bone<br>
    suddenly begins to pulse. She immediately runs in the<br>
    opposite direction.</p>
  <p> As she disappears around a corner, the four Alliance<br>
    members arrive from the left.</p>
  <p> They cautiously move forward. One of the Alliance<br>
    members pauses at the corner and shifts towards the<br>
    left -- a diamond shape below his collar bone suddenly<br>
    pulses GREEN. (As with Ishara, his shirt is open<br>
    enough at the neck to expose the spot. The other<br>
    Alliance members are pulsing GREEN beneath their<br>
    shirts.)</p>
  <p> He silently indicates the others to fan out as they<br>
    head after her, splitting up behind the various low<br>
    walls and projections and debris as they do so.</p>

  <p>35 INT. ADJOINING CORRIDOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ishara is creeping along behind a series of<br>
    projections, the alarms blaring around her. She<br>
    suddenly stops dead in her tracks, as her implant<br>
    pulses orange/yellow. She whips around -- the guard<br>
    has just stepped from behind a low wall. Ishara aims<br>
    her phaser too late -- the guard swings his stunstick,<br>
    which lets out a bright, crackling arc flash that hits<br>
    Ishara across the ribcage, sending her flying across<br>
    the floor, her phaser fire rainbowing across the air<br>
    as she goes.</p>
  <p> The guard quickly advances as Ishara tries in a daze to<br>
    struggle to her feet, reaching her and aiming the<br>
    stunstick right at her face -- only to fall to the<br>
    ground, stunned by a phaser blast.</p>

  <p> As he starts to hurry across to Ishara -- and is<br>
    suddenly fired upon by two men from behind a<br>

    still dazed Ishara attempts to stand. He reaches her<br>
    and hauls the barely conscious woman into the next<br>

  <p> Ishara seems taken aback by the story.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Her ship had responded to their<br>
    distress call, as had mine. When<br>
    it was all over, I requested that<br>
    Tasha be assigned to the<br>
    Enterprise.<br>

  <p> Data touches a control, causing the map to display a<br>
    series of small concentric circles over the spot,<br>
    symbolically suggestive of a radiating power source.</p>

  <p> Ishara again points to the map.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    This chamber is accessed from the<br>
    level below. Entry points are<br>
    evenly spaced along this wall<br>
    every twenty-five meters.</p>
  <p> Data again touches a control. Ishara looks up, taking<br>
    in the sight of the bridge for a few moments. She's<br>
    curious in spite of herself.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Data... Where was Tasha's post?</p>
  <p> Data seems a little surprised that she is asking about<br>
    her sister, given her previous reluctance about the<br>
    subject.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Tactical Station -- where<br>
    Lieutenant Worf is now.</p>
  <p> Worf has noticed Ishara's attention. He nods his<br>
    acknowledgement. Ishara smiles in return. She seems<br>
    to be starting to fit in. She turns back to Data,<br>
    again curious in spite of herself.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Did Tasha have many friends here?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. She was especially close<br>
    to Commander Riker and Lieutenant<br>
    Worf. And to myself.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Are you able to have friends?</p>
  <p> Data looks up from the task in front of him.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes.</p>

  <p> ISHARA<br>
    But you don't have feelings, do<br>
    you?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Not as such. However, perhaps<br>
    even among humans, friendship is<br>
    sometimes less an emotional<br>
    response, and more a sense of<br>
    familiarity.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (understanding)<br>
    You can become used to someone.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Exactly. As I experience certain<br>
    sensory input patterns, my mental<br>
    pathways become accustomed to<br>
    them. The inputs eventually are<br>
    anticipated. And even &quot;missed&quot;<br>
    when absent. When something once<br>
    expected is no longer there.</p>
  <p> A quiet beat. This may be the first time in ten years<br>
    Ishara has allowed herself to feel the loss.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Like my sister.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Like your sister.</p>
  <p> OFF the quiet look on Ishara's face.</p>
  <p>45 INT. ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi, Worf, Data, Riker, and Ishara are poring over<br>
    the schematic map of the underground city.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    They've been moved so far<br>
    underground that it took awhile<br>
    to pinpoint their signatures.</p>
  <p> He indicates a place on the map.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The men are here. Next to one<br>
    of the Alliance headquarters.</p>

  <p>46 INSERT SCHEMATIC MAP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> which shows the pyramid-shaped underground series of<br>
    levels and chambers.</p>
  <p> Geordi is pointing to a chamber close to Alliance<br>
    headquarters deep in their territory, located near the<br>
    edge of the pyramid shape's base.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And that's about two kilometers<br>
    of solid granite above them.</p>
  <p>47 RESUME</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So much for the transporter.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Not necessarily. We could use<br>
    the ship's phasers to cut a shaft<br>
    through the bedrock to this<br>
    storage tunnel here.</p>
  <p>47A INSERT SCHEMATIC MAP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi's hand indicates a line starting from just<br>
    outside the surface settlement and heading straight<br>
    down through the ground to a chamber near the one he<br>
    previously indicated.</p>
  <p> GEORDI (O.S.)<br>
    With a clear path through the<br>
    rock, we'd be able to transport<br>
    down to the tunnel. That would<br>
    put us close enough to get to the<br>
    crewmen.</p>
  <p> Geordi's finger traces out the steps on the map.</p>
  <p>47B RESUME</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    It would take me a few hours to<br>
    adjust the phasers for drilling.</p>

  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's a maze around there...</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    I spent a lot of time in that<br>
    section before they took it over.<br>
    There are blind tunnels and dead<br>
    ends that don't even show up on<br>
    this map.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    We don't have much choice.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    If it wasn't for my implant<br>
    setting off all the alarms, I<br>
    could guide you to your men.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We could remove the implant.</p>
  <p> Ishara shakes her head.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    It has a micro-explosive inside<br>
    that detonates on contact with<br>
    air. When you join a cadre, you<br>
    join for life.</p>
  <p> Data considers this a moment.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A small force field containing<br>
    xenon or another inert gas could<br>
    be placed over the incision site.<br>
    The explosive could thereby be<br>
    safely disarmed at the same time<br>
    it is removed.</p>
  <p> For once with respect to strategy, Ishara seems to hold<br>
    back, a hesitant look on her face. Riker picks up on<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    It's more than just a tactical<br>
    device to you, isn't it? It's<br>
    part of your identity.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>

  <p> She doesn't answer, seems to be struggling with the<br>
    issue.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    This is something you'll have to<br>
    decide for yourself, Ishara.<br>
    Think about it while we're waiting<br>
    for Geordi.</p>
  <p> She nods, still obviously unsure.</p>

    is in front of Ishara.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Our parents were killed in some<br>
    crossfire just after I was born.<br>
    Some people took care of us for<br>
    a few months... Then one day we<br>
    came home and they were gone.<br>
    So Tasha took care of me. And<br>
    when I got old enough, I joined<br>
    the Coalition.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And Tasha did not?</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    My sister hated the cadres.<br>
    Blamed them for our parents death.<br>
    For everything. She refused to<br>
    join. And she left as soon as<br>
    she had the chance.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>50 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing, doubtful)<br>
    I always thought she was weak for<br>
    doing that...</p>
  <p> Ishara seems to be struggling with an unavoidable<br>
    conclusion.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But maybe I was wrong. Maybe<br>
    she made the right choice.</p>
  <p> Ishara indicates the ship around them.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    To work together for something<br>
    besides killing... to be close<br>
    to someone without having to<br>
    protect your back.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You find that appealing?</p>
  <p> She smiles at his innocent choice of words.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Very appealing. You're a perfect<br>
    example. I hardly even know you<br>
    Data, but already I completely<br>
    trust you. I even consider you<br>
    my friend.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you. I would like to<br>
    consider you my friend, Ishara.</p>
  <p> She grows quiet, filled with a deep sense of regret.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    If I had known about this place<br>
    fifteen years ago, things might've<br>
    been different.</p>
  <p> She stares at Data's open face for a long beat.</p>

  <p>51 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is standing with Data and Troi.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Ishara is willing to have the<br>
    implant removed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very good. You may inform Doctor<br>
    Crusher.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She also expressed a desire to<br>
    leave the colony. She hopes<br>
    to apply to the Academy and<br>
    eventually join Starfleet.</p>
  <p> Picard is completely taken aback. Troi is<br>
    particularly disturbed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Does she understand the magnitude<br>
    of these decisions?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    She claims to, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Her courage certainly speaks in<br>
    her favor. But Ishara's personal<br>
    history concerns me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Did her sister not come from the<br>
    very same environment, Sir?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT THREE 38.</p>
  <p>51 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Tasha never joined one of these<br>
    gangs. Doesn't that suggest a<br>
    fundamental difference between<br>
    the two of them?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I do not know. But I do know that<br>
    often for humans, decisions made<br>
    in youth only hold true for youth.</p>
  <p> Impressed by Data's reasoning, Picard turns to Troi,<br>
    who shakes her head, concerned.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I get a sense of ambiguity from<br>
    her. Her loyalties are clearly<br>
    divided, Captain, no matter what<br>
    she may say.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Are you suggesting we deny her<br>
    an escape from this environment,<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No... I'm just not convinced she<br>
    really wants to escape. It is<br>
    the only way of life she's ever<br>
    known.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ultimately, it is her decision<br>
    to make, not ours...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Certainly nothing would please<br>
    me more than to see another<br>
    officer named Yar in the service<br>
    of Starfleet... Mister Data,<br>

    discussed...</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    You seem so strong in your<br>
    support. I'm curious...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    We must free the crewmen. She<br>
    appears to be our best hope of<br>
    doing so. Also, individuals<br>
    worthy of Starfleet training are<br>
    somewhat rare.</p>

    I have become used to her.</p>

  <p> Data has arrived moments ago to where Ishara has been<br>

  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Thank you, Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You are welcome. Doctor Crusher<br>
    is expecting you in Sickbay.</p>
  <p> She smiles, seems almost amazed.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    It's all so different...</p>

    there have been changes...</p>
  <p> She looks around for a few more moments, makes a<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    It's through here.</p>
  <p> She guides them towards one of the openings.</p>
  <p>68 FOLLOW (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Ishara leads the away team through an opening, past<br>
    a couple of turns, to a place where they can see a<br>
    secure-looking door, and one Alliance man standing<br>
    guard nearby.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Your men are behind that door.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at the others, 'Let's do it... ' he moves<br>
    stealthily into a forward position... and when the<br>
    guard reacts to his movement, he fires -- the guard<br>
    collapses, stunned. The away team rushes the door.<br>
    Riker and Worf fire point-blank at the door when they<br>
    get there, knocking it over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>68 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Riker, Data and Worf dive into the room. Ishara<br>
    remains outside and on guard.</p>
  <p>69 INT. CHAMBER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A nondescript chamber. Riker, Data and Worf find Tan<br>
    Tsu and the other crewman on their feet, hands bound<br>
    together with some high-tech looking restraints.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Hold out your hands.</p>
  <p> The crewmen comply as Riker fires a phaser blast at<br>
    one of the restraints.</p>
  <p>70 INT. TUNNEL (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Ishara glances back towards the chamber, then<br>
    immediately and with intent, heads away from the room,<br>
    clearly pursuing her own agenda.</p>
  <p> As she approaches a tunnel opening, a guard suddenly<br>
    appears from within the tunnel, shocked to find her<br>
    there. She blasts him with her phaser, winging him.</p>
  <p> Injured, the man falls to the ground, but manages with<br>
    his last remaining strength to fire his phaser up at<br>
    a small metal panel on the wall several meters away,<br>
    before passing out. The panel answers with an<br>
    ear-shattering alarm.</p>
  <p> Ishara, clearly distressed by the alarm, continues<br>
    running the direction she was headed, disappearing into<br>
    the tunnel.</p>
  <p>71 INT. CHAMBER</p>
  <p> Riker frees the last crewman as all react to the sudden<br>
    alarm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Let's get moving.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR 48.</p>
  <p>72 INT. TUNNEL</p>
  <p> The away team and crewmen come flying out of the room<br>
    -- Ishara is nowhere to be seen.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Where is she?</p>
  <p> This is just what he didn't want to happen. Worf<br>
    spots the wounded and unconscious guard across the<br>
    tunnel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Commander, look.</p>
  <p> Riker sees the guard.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What the hell happened here?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    She probably tried to draw their<br>
    fire. It triggered the alarm.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    Worf, get these men back to the<br>
    Enterprise.<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Data, you're with me. She can't<br>
    be far.</p>
  <p> Worf hurries the crewmen out the way they came as Riker<br>
    and Data split up and head towards the two tunnels<br>
    opposite.</p>
  <p>73 INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE POWER GENERATOR (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> One Alliance guard is standing outside what looks like<br>
    a room-sized power generator. He appears edgy about<br>
    the distant alarm. Ishara steps from around a<br>
    projection, phaser raised. The guard has a second to<br>
    register complete surprise at her presence before she<br>
    blasts him away.</p>
  <p> She moves quickly to the generator, fires her phaser<br>
    at a panel, which falls away, revealing the control<br>
    devices underneath. She quickly steps forward and<br>
    manipulates the controls. In response, the generator<br>
    begins a slowly escalating hum.</p>
  <p> DATA (O.S.)<br>
    Ishara.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR 48A.</p>
  <p>74 INCLUDE DATA</p>
  <p> standing several yards away. He lowers his phaser,<br>
    puzzled at her actions.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What are you doing?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FOUR 49.</p>
  <p>74 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> She turns and faces him -- doesn't answer. He looks<br>
    from her to the generator with its increasingly shrill<br>
    sound.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The fusion generator is<br>
    overloading.<br>
    (turns to her)<br>
    You are attempting to disable the<br>
    defense system. For what reason?<br>
    We have rescued the crewmen.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    I don't care about your crewmen.<br>
    We have three thousand troops<br>
    waiting at the perimeter. When<br>
    the defenses go down, they'll come<br>
    in. The Alliance will fall.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Federation will be responsible<br>
    for the resulting deaths. I<br>
    cannot allow that.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You don't have a choice.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is not true.</p>
  <p> He steps forward.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    I don't want to kill you, Data.</p>
  <p> She looks like she genuinely doesn't. But she clicks<br>
    the setting on her phaser, aiming straight at his<br>
    chest.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But I will.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FOUR </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 50.</p>
  <p> ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>75 INT. TUNNEL OUTSIDE POWER GENERATOR</p>
  <p> Ishara's phaser is trained on Data; Ishara is<br>
    positioned between Data and the increasingly<br>
    overloading generator.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: the generator)<br>
    We will both be destroyed in the<br>
    explosion.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    The Coalition's been all I've<br>
    had for fifteen years. They've<br>
    given me a life. I don't mind<br>
    dying for them.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    But you won't have to if you get<br>
    out of here right now.</p>
  <p> Data doesn't move.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Was this your intention from the<br>
    beginning?</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    We never could have gotten this<br>
    deep into Alliance territory<br>
    without your help.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Our help was not deliberate. You<br>
    deceived us.</p>
  <p> She seems defensive, as though feeling some guilt about<br>
    what's happened.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    What's the difference? You got<br>
    what you came for. Why should<br>
    you care about what we do?</p>
  <p> A beat as Data seems to come to a conclusion about<br>
    something.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/5/90 - ACT FIVE 51.</p>
  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Your friendship with me was part<br>
    of the deception, was it not?</p>
  <p> Her silence is her answer. She is not proud of it.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You misled me at each step. And<br>
    yet I was completely unaware.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    That doesn't matter now! None<br>
    of it does!<br>
    (desperately)<br>
    Get out of here, Data. Please.</p>
  <p> The generator suddenly increases its hum exponentially.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (re: the generator)<br>
    My duty requires me to intercede.</p>
  <p> And it all happens very quickly -- as he starts to step<br>
    forward...</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Stop...</p>
  <p> She clasps both hands on the phaser, tenses for firing<br>
    --</p>
  <p> RIKER (O.S.)<br>
    Ishara!</p>
  <p>76 INCLUDE RIKER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Stepping from behind a projection, phaser raised.<br>
    Ishara immediately fires at Riker, missing as he ducks<br>
    back behind the projection, giving Data the split<br>
    second he needs to raise his phaser and fire at her.</p>
  <p> Ishara crumples, stunned by Data's phaser.</p>
  <p> Data rushes to the generator and starts working the<br>
    controls under the exposed panel. Riker goes to<br>
    Ishara, crouches down to see if she's alright.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 52.</p>
  <p>76 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What was she doing?</p>
  <p> Data steps back from the generator as its humming whine<br>
    begins to subside.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Disabling the detection system<br>
    so her forces could attack.</p>
  <p> Riker picks up Ishara's phaser as she starts to regain<br>
    consciousness. He stares at Data.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Set to kill.</p>
  <p> OFF Data's neutral expression as he continues to<br>
    process everything.</p>
  <p>76A EXT. ENTERPRISE</p>
  <p> In orbit around Turkana Four.</p>
  <p>76B INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> A security man is standing guard outside crew's<br>
    quarters. Worf approaches, stands in front of the door<br>
    -- it slides open.</p>
  <p>76C ANGLE ON ISHARA</p>
  <p> sitting inside the room, like a prisoner awaiting her<br>
    fate.</p>
  <p>76D INCLUDE WORF</p>
  <p> who seems barely able to tolerate her presence.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    The Captain wants to see you on<br>
    the bridge.</p>
  <p> Ishara stands, leaves the room and joins Worf, as the<br>
    door slides shut behind her. Worf heads up the<br>
    corridor, Ishara falling into step beside him. They<br>
    continue for a few beats.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 52A.</p>
  <p>76D CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    What's going to happen to me?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    That is Captain Picard's decision.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If the captain were Klingon, you<br>
    would be executed.</p>
  <p> Worf avoids looking at her, but Ishara glances up at<br>
    him. Again, Ishara's voice is subdued -- she's not<br>
    arguing, just trying to give an account of herself.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    Sometimes a warrior must use<br>
    deception in the service of her<br>
    cause.<br>
    (beat, quietly)<br>
    If anyone on this ship should know<br>
    that, it's you.</p>
  <p> They reach the turbolift. Worf stares at her.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Such a warrior must also be<br>
    prepared to suffer the<br>
    consequences.</p>
  <p> Worf coldly turns away. Hold for a beat on Ishara's<br>
    face.</p>
  <p>77 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> The turbolift opens. Worf and Ishara step out and<br>
    cross towards the center of the bridge, where Picard is<br>
    facing the viewscreen. There is a vast coolness<br>
    towards her from everyone -- in extreme contrast to<br>
    the last time we saw them all together.</p>
  <p> All are facing the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your strategy failed.</p>
  <p>78 INSERT VIEWSCREEN (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A clearly-disappointed but not the least bit apologetic<br>
    Hayne is facing them. Any sense of his disarming<br>
    personality is gone.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE 52B.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    It was a calculated risk. You<br>
    gave us an opportunity we couldn't<br>
    ignore.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Are you hurt, Ishara?</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT FIVE 53.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    (to Picard)<br>
    I want her returned immediately.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (angered)<br>
    You're not in a position to<br>
    dictate to anybody. She attacked<br>
    two Federation officers.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    You have no jurisdiction here!</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Don't talk about legal rights.<br>
    Your jurisdiction is based<br>
    entirely on the threat of<br>
    violence.</p>
  <p> A beat as Hayne realizes he isn't convincing anybody.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    You have your crewmen back. Isn't<br>
    that enough?</p>
  <p> Picard and Ishara are looking at each other -- a silent<br>
    moment between them.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Data, escort Ishara to<br>
    the transporter toom.</p>
  <p> Riker and other officers react with surprise. Picard<br>
    turns back to the viewscreen.</p>
  <p> HAYNE<br>
    Thank you, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard doesn't acknowledge Hayne's response in any way<br>
    whatsoever.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Close the channel.</p>
  <p> Worf does so, as Data stands and goes to Ishara.</p>
  <p> In silence, Ishara turns with Data and they both head<br>
    for the turbolift, entering it, and leaving the Bridge.</p>
  <p> Everyone turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 53A.</p>
  <p>78 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    You're far more charitable than<br>
    I would have been, Captain.</p>
  <p> Picard pauses for a moment, glances around the room.<br>
    There's a sadness in his voice.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I understand your feelings, Number<br>
    One. I share them. But perhaps<br>
    the fault lies in ourselves. We<br>
    were so eager to embrace her.<br>
    Each of us, myself included,<br>
    wanted to see something of Tasha<br>
    in her sister. We saw more than<br>
    what was there.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 54.</p>
  <p>79 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data and Ishara are walking, not looking at each other.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You haven't said one word to me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    What do you wish to talk about?</p>
  <p> She looks at him -- decides not to pursue it. They<br>
    continue walking straight ahead.</p>
  <p>80 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM</p>
  <p> Data and Ishara are standing in front of the<br>
    transporter units.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    I did what I had to. I'm sorry<br>
    if I hurt you in the process.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reminding her)<br>
    I am an android. It is not<br>
    possible for me to be injured<br>
    in that fashion.</p>
  <p>81 ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER CHIEF</p>
  <p> As he finishes setting the controls.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Whenever you're ready.</p>
  <p>82 RESUME DATA AND ISHARA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data and Ishara look at each other for a couple of<br>
    silent moments.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/28/90 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>82 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Ishara steps onto a transporter pad and turns to face<br>
    him, unable to keep the sadness out of her voice.</p>
  <p> ISHARA<br>
    You know, I wasn't always lying<br>
    to you, Data. The time we spent<br>
    talking... it was the closest<br>
    thing to friendship I've ever had.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    If that means anything to you.</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> The Transporter beam appears, Ishara DEMATERIALIZES<br>
    into it and is gone.</p>
  <p>83 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> travelling at impulse speed through space.</p>
  <p>84 INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Riker is working on a report.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> The door slides open and Data ENTERS. Riker is a<br>
    little puzzled by the visit, but is pleasantly<br>
    accommodating.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Data. Come in, come in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> Data steps forward, as Riker stands to greet him.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What's on your mind?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Recent events have left me<br>
    puzzled, Sir.<br>
    (off Riker's look)<br>
    It has been days since Ishara<br>
    left. And yet, my thoughts seem<br>
    to dwell on her. Almost as if<br>
    I were experiencing a feedback<br>
    loop in my mnemonic network.</p>
  <p> Riker frowns at the subject... still trying to figure<br>
    it out for himself.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I know what you mean.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is curious that I was so easily<br>
    misled.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Make that &quot;we.&quot;</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes sir.</p>
  <p> Riker considers him for a moment, seems to soften a<br>
    bit. How does he explain it to Data when he doesn't<br>
    quite understand it himself?</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, in every trust is the<br>
    possibility of betrayal. I don't<br>
    think you were prepared for that.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Were you prepared?</p>
  <p> Riker takes a beat, shakes his head, sighs.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I'm not sure anybody ever is.</p>
  <p> Data considers this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Then is it better not to trust?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 56A.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Without trust, there can be no<br>
    friendship, no closeness. None<br>
    of the emotional bonds that make<br>
    us what we are.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    And yet you put yourself at risk.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Every single time. Love itself<br>
    is a leap of faith.</p>
  <p> Data absorbs this.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/29/90 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>84 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    So, a prerequisite for love is<br>
    accepting the risk of betrayal.</p>
  <p> Riker is a little surprised by Data's conclusion.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    That's an interesting point of<br>
    view, Data. Maybe you're right.</p>
  <p> A moment between them as Data glances away, still<br>
    seeming to process these thoughts. Rikers's voice is<br>
    quiet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    The emotions we experience when<br>
    someone we believe in turns away<br>
    -- they're the most painful a<br>
    person can feel.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    We believed in her, Data...</p>
  <p> Data thinks about this.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Perhaps I am fortunate to<br>
    be spared the emotional<br>
    consequences.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (gently)<br>
    Perhaps...</p>
  <p> Data nods his thanks. FOLLOW Data as he turns and goes<br>
    out the door.</p>
  <p>85 OMITTED</p>
  <p>86 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> The door closes behind him as Data takes few steps then<br>
    pauses.</p>
  <p> He waits for a moment, then raises his closed hand. He<br>
    opens it, revealing Ishara's jewel-like implant resting<br>
    on his palm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Legacy&quot; - REV. 8/27/90 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>86 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Data stares at it for several silent moments, his face<br>
    completely unreadable.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
