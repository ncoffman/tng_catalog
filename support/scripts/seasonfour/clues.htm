  Our diplomatic assignment in the<br>

  The ship just went through a<br>

  thirty seconds.</p>

  There's a general feeling of<br>

<p align="center"> DATA<br>
  Sir, it is likely that the<br>
  anomalous readings were caused by<br>
  the wormhole's effect. It was<br>
  extremely unstable. I would<br>
  recommend against returning. It<br>
  might put the Enterprise at<br>
  further risk.</p>
<p align="center"> RIKER<br>
  We could sent a probe...</p>

  That would certainly be<br>
  sufficient, Commander.</p>
