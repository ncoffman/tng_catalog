    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At impulse power.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's Log, Stardate 44614.6:<br>
    We are approaching Starbase<br>
    Three-One-Three, where we will<br>
    pick up a shipment of scientific<br>
    equipment for a Federation outpost<br>
    in the Guernica System. At the<br>
    same time --</p>
  <p>2 INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM</p>
  <p> as the door opens and GEORDI ENTERS; PICARD is at his<br>
    desk.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    -- we will be hosting a special<br>
    guest.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You wanted to see me, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes, Mister La Forge. It seems<br>
    that the exemplary nature of your<br>
    work has caught the attention of<br>
    Starfleet Command.</p>
  <p> Geordi isn't quite sure what this means, but it sounds<br>
    good.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well... that's very flattering.<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    In fact, someone is coming on<br>
    board just to see some of the<br>
    engine modifications you have<br>
    made.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Better yet... Geordi's feeling very pleased.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Who's that, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The Senior Design Engineer of the<br>
    Theoretical Propulsion Group --<br>
    Doctor Leah Brahms.</p>
  <p> Leah Brahms... Geordi can't believe it. His smile<br>
    grows even wider.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Leah's coming here? That's<br>
    terrific!</p>
  <p> Picard is a little surprised at the familiarity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You know Doctor Brahms?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, of course I do! I --</p>
  <p> Suddenly he stops, realizes what he's about to say,<br>
    swiftly regroups.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I mean, I've studied her -- her<br>
    schematics for years. She was<br>
    responsible for a lot of the<br>
    engine design on the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, it should be an enjoyable<br>
    visit, then. She'll be<br>
    transporting on board as soon as<br>
    we arrive at the Starbase. Would<br>
    you like to greet her on our<br>
    behalf?</p>
  <p> Would he... !</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (restrained)<br>
    Why... yes, Captain. I'd be happy<br>
    to serve that function.</p>
  <p> Then, smiling like a kid anticipating Christmas, he<br>
    EXITS. Picard is mildly amused by his exuberance, but<br>
    attributes it to scholarly enthusiasm.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 INT. ENTERPRISE - TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Geordi sits at the bar, drinking juice and trying to<br>
    stay calm. But he's clearly a little hyper... keeps<br>
    brushing invisible lint from his uniform. GUINAN is<br>
    behind the bar, eyeing all this.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    You're gonna wear that uniform<br>
    out if you keep swatting at it...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I guess I'm a little nervous...<br>
    it's not every day a man comes<br>
    face to face with a dream...</p>
  <p> She looks at him quizzically.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Remember... about a year ago...<br>
    when we were caught in that<br>
    booby-trap the Menthars set?</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Yes...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    While we were trying to get out<br>
    of it, I went to the holodeck to<br>
    study an engine prototype that<br>
    was built when the Enterprise was<br>
    first designed...</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    Uh-huh...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And the computer... well, it gave<br>
    me an image of the engine... but<br>
    it also created a hologram of the<br>
    designer. Doctor Leah Brahms.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    So... you met a computer-simulated<br>
    female...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    But what a computer-simulated<br>
    female... She was brilliant, of<br>
    course... but warm, friendly...<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/12/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI (Cont'd)<br>
    We worked like one person... what<br>
    I didn't think of, she did... I'd<br>
    start sentences, she'd finish<br>
    them. It was just so --<br>
    comfortable...</p>
  <p> He looks up at her in the midst of the paean and sees<br>
    her skeptical look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay, I know it was just a<br>
    holographic image... but the<br>
    computer was able to incorporate<br>
    personality traits from her<br>
    Starfleet record.</p>
  <p> GUINAN<br>
    We all fall in love with our<br>
    fantasies, from time to time,<br>
    La Forge...</p>
  <p> But Geordi's in no mood for cold water. He smiles,<br>
    slips off the bar stool.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You've got it wrong, Guinan. I'm<br>
    not necessarily expecting anything<br>
    romantic. I just know that,<br>
    whatever else, Leah Brahms and<br>
    I will be good friends.</p>
  <p> And he saunters out, leaving Guinan gazing after him.</p>
  <p>4 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - LATER</p>
  <p> Geordi waits with TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN.</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN<br>
    Doctor Brahms is ready to<br>
    transport, sir.</p>
  <p> Geordi can't wait.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay. Bring her over.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4A ANGLE - TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as the shimmering effect occurs and LEAH BRAHMS<br>
    MATERIALIZES. She looks a little different than she<br>
    did in &quot;Booby Trap&quot;... her hair is styled differently,<br>
    fuller... she's a few years older but the maturity<br>
    looks good on her. She has the same kind face and<br>
    intelligent eyes... but there's something off about<br>
    her... a set to the mouth, a sharpness. The softness<br>
    and vulnerability aren't as evident. She gazes around<br>
    the room, getting her bearings. Geordi approaches her,<br>
    smiling broadly.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hi!</p>
  <p> She looks at him, puzzled by the familiarity. Geordi<br>
    catches himself, starts over.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I mean... welcome aboard, Doctor<br>
    Brahms. I'm Lieutenant Commander<br>
    Geordi La Forge. Chief Engineer.</p>
  <p> Her eyes narrow... her gaze burrows into him like a<br>
    laser.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    La Forge. So you're the one who's<br>
    fouled up my engine design.</p>
  <p> And with that, she strides off the pad and past Geordi,<br>
    who stares after her in astonishment.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> at warp speed.</p>
  <p>6 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - LATER</p>
  <p> Leah is stalking the engine room like a panther,<br>
    checking everything, registering her finds on a Padd.<br>
    Geordi follows her, well able to stay up with her<br>
    barrage of questions, but feeling inescapably on the<br>
    defensive. ENSIGN PAVLIK can be seen working in the<br>
    b.g.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    ... the matter/anti-matter ratio<br>
    has been changed... the mixture<br>
    isn't as rich as regulations<br>
    dictate.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Experience has shown me that too<br>
    high a ratio diminishes<br>
    efficiency. I worked with the<br>
    mixture until I got the right<br>
    balance.</p>
  <p> She makes no response, continues. If she were the old<br>
    hologram, you might guess her personality wasn't<br>
    installed yet.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    The magnetic plasma transfer to<br>
    the warp field generators doesn't<br>
    correspond to the recommended<br>
    specs.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right. Again, I adjusted the<br>
    flow... sometimes in space things<br>
    work a little differently than<br>
    they do on the drawing board.</p>
  <p> She shoots him a glance at this, registering a dig.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Is that a criticism, Commander?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No, of course not. It's just...<br>
    a well-known fact. There's<br>
    theory... and there's<br>
    application. They don't always<br>
    jibe.</p>
  <p> Her cool gaze assesses him. It feels like being probed<br>
    by an ice cube.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    You've charted a completely new<br>
    swap-out schedule for main<br>
    component replacement...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You bet. I found the Starfleet<br>
    estimates of MTBF units were<br>
    unrealistic. I determined my own<br>
    schedule based on observation and<br>
    experience.</p>
  <p> Geordi faces her squarely. He doesn't like the feeling<br>
    of being called on the carpet... he's a professional<br>
    and a good one; he shouldn't have to make excuses to<br>
    anyone. A faint smile -- sardonic, not warm -- plays<br>
    on Leah's lips.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Is that going to be your only<br>
    defense, Commander? That same<br>
    tired rhetoric...<br>
    (mimicking)<br>
    &quot;Out here in the field we learn<br>
    things you designers couldn't<br>
    possibly understand... &quot;</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    In the first place, Doctor, I'm<br>
    not aware of needing any<br>
    defense... in the second place<br>
    --</p>
  <p> COM VOICE<br>
    Doctor Brahms... you have an<br>
    incoming message on subspace...</p>
  <p> She turns to him.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I'd like to hear this message<br>
    privately.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (gesturing)<br>
    In my office. Be my guest.</p>
  <p> She hurries off camera, leaving Geordi alone.<br>
    Mystified. He turns glumly to the engine room... his<br>
    pride and joy... that he'd hoped to share with its<br>
    creator.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA, and WORF at their stations. ENSIGN RAGER<br>
    at Con.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Commander, I am picking up some<br>
    unusual readings from the Alpha<br>
    Omicron system.</p>
  <p> Riker moves over to Ops.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    At this range, all I can discern<br>
    is that it is an asymmetrical<br>
    field of intense energy.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What type of radiation<br>
    signature?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Unknown, sir.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Commander, the Alpha Omicron<br>
    system has not yet been charted.<br>
    I recommend that we take this<br>
    opportunity for further research.</p>
  <p> Riker thinks for a beat.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We're way ahead of schedule...<br>
    (to Rager)<br>
    Alter course for Alpha Omicron.</p>
  <p>8 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship drops out of warp in a star system.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>9 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard is now standing near Ops with Riker.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The anomaly is orbiting the<br>
    seventh planet. It is a mass of<br>
    plasma energy contained within<br>
    discrete boundaries by an outer<br>
    covering of silicates, actinides,<br>
    and carbonaceaous chondrites.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>10 VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL) - INTERCUT AS NEEDED</p>
  <p> The viewer shows a large gas giant planet with a barely<br>
    perceptible smudge of energy near the horizon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> Data works his console and the object on the viewer<br>
    gets bigger. We can now see the object is pulsing and<br>
    moving fluidly... it looks like a water balloon filled<br>
    with glowing liquid that changes color frequently.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it a ship?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (reading console)<br>
    It does not conform to any known<br>
    design.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any records of similar phenomena<br>
    in Starfleet listings?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (processes for a moment)<br>
    None, sir. This has never been<br>
    seen before.</p>
  <p> Picard smiles... he and Riker exchange a look of<br>
    pleasure. This is why they're on the Enterprise.<br>
    Picard goes to his station, and there is a palpable<br>
    sense of excitement and anticipation in his attitude<br>
    toward this discovery.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ensign Rager, ahead one quarter<br>
    impulse. Bring us into orbit<br>
    around the seventh planet.<br>
    Maintain a relative distance of<br>
    ten kilometers from the object.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Alert all science labs to standby.<br>
    They should be coordinating their<br>
    efforts with Commander Data.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>11 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Leah returns, icy as ever. But Geordi has had a few<br>
    minutes to assess the situation, and has decided to<br>
    take another tack. He smiles at her... warm...<br>
    poised... confident.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Doctor Brahms... there's no reason<br>
    for us to argue... we're both on<br>
    the same side, here...</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I'm aware of that...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    So, why don't I take you on a<br>
    little tour... show you the<br>
    adjustments I've made... why I<br>
    think they work... and... we can<br>
    start pulling together on this.</p>
  <p> She inclines her head, makes a little gesture for him<br>
    to proceed. Geordi's feeling much better... now<br>
    they're off on the right foot.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay... for instance, here in the<br>
    dilithium chamber...</p>
  <p> She peers in, reacts sharply, accusing.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/12/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    What happened here? Who did this?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You remember, the crystal's been<br>
    reoriented to adjust the direction<br>
    of the lattice structure.</p>
  <p> She turns, looks at him.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Remember? Why would I remember?</p>
  <p> Oops.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Right, why would you? The ship<br>
    was having some difficulties, so<br>
    we made the modification. Hoping<br>
    it would work. And... it did.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    So it was your idea?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, not exclusively...</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    It's curious... this modification<br>
    was actually due to be<br>
    introduced...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nodding, finishing her<br>
    sentence)<br>
    ... in the next class starship.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    Yes... how did you know?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (faltering)<br>
    I didn't... It was the next<br>
    logical step.<br>
    (off her look)<br>
    Doctor, sometimes we have to<br>
    fly by the seat of our pants<br>
    out here... and it stands to<br>
    reason that now and then we're<br>
    gonna come up with the same<br>
    solutions you do...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Galaxy's Child&quot; - REV. 12/10/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> She's dubious, but it makes sense... He draws a<br>
    breath, tries to keep it warm and light.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Listen. I've got a personnel<br>
    review scheduled to start in about<br>
    five minutes, and it's been a long<br>
    day for you. How about we...<br>
    we get together later. Sort of...<br>
    plan our agenda for the next day<br>
    or two.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Agenda?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What it is we want to<br>
    accomplish... the best way to<br>
    go about it... and -- get to know<br>
    each other. It might make things<br>
    easier.</p>
  <p> She gives him a searching look, and for a moment she<br>
    loosens a little, as though realizing she's been pretty<br>
    testy.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Maybe you're right...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Okay -- nineteen hundred hours...<br>
    my quarters. Maybe we'll even<br>
    have a bite to eat... I make great<br>
    fungilli.</p>
  <p> She smiles in surprise.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I love fungilli.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Sensors are having difficulty<br>
    penetrating the interior.<br>
    However, the pattern of radiated<br>
    output suggests a coherent system<br>
    of energy storage and<br>
    utilization.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Then it was constructed by<br>
    someone?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is a possibility, sir.<br>
    However, sensor data gathered thus<br>
    far suggests this is a naturally<br>
    occurring phenomenon with<br>
    biological properties.</p>

    A lifeform?</p>

    Yes, Captain.</p>

    &quot;To the child's delight the answer<br>

  <p> Surprised looks from everyone. Worf is a little<br>

  <p> WORF<br>
    We are being probed. Recommend<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Negative. If we're curious about<br>

    we are directly responsible for<br>

  <p>31 INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING</p>
  <p> Geordi's at a monitor, working. His attitude --<br>
    developed after much tossing and turning all night --<br>
    is professional and detached. He barely looks up as<br>
    Leah ENTERS. She, on the other hand, seems friendlier<br>
    than before. Or maybe just more rested. (NOTE:<br>
    Neither of them should be in jumpsuits yet.)</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Good morning!</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Morning.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    The first thing I'd like to do<br>
    is inspect the power transfer<br>
    conduits.</p>
  <p> This catches Geordi off guard. Leah... theoretical<br>
    physicist, prim and dignified, inching her way through<br>
    a narrow tube? He can't help a query.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You realize the only way to<br>
    inspect them is to crawl inside...</p>
  <p> Bad reaction. She fixes those sub-zero eyes on him<br>
    again.</p>

  <p> LEAH<br>
    I designed them, Commander... I<br>
    know what's involved.</p>
  <p> And she brushes past him toward the engine<br>
    compartments.</p>
  <p>32 INT. ENTERPRISE - INSIDE CRAWLSPACE</p>
  <p> (NOTE: Now their jumpsuits are on.) Some kind of<br>
    cramped, narrow tube they're crawling through... with<br>
    almost no room to maneuver... and very, very close.<br>
    Leah's face is smudged with grease, her hair is<br>
    messed... and she looks adorable. The characteristic<br>
    THRUM of the engines can be heard in the b.g.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Watch out for the power taps.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    (listening)<br>
    The acoustic signature doesn't<br>
    sound right.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're probably the only other<br>
    person in the galaxy who could<br>
    pick that up.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    What's causing it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    It's right up here.</p>
  <p> They stop flat on their sides, facing each other with<br>
    almost no room to manuever... and very, very close.<br>
    Geordi points out a small piece of equipment.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I've never seen anything like<br>
    this... what is it?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A mid-range phase adjuster... it<br>
    puts the plasma back into phase<br>
    after inertial distortion.</p>

  <p> LEAH<br>
    This has never been done before.<br>
    I don't think it's ever been<br>
    conceived of before. You should<br>
    write a scientific paper.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    That's not my strong suit,<br>
    Doctor...</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    But this kind of refinement should<br>
    be shared... and you deserve the<br>
    credit for it...</p>
  <p> Geordi is buoyed by her praise.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Maybe we could collaborate.<br>
    Writing is one of your strong<br>
    points.</p>
  <p> She hesitates, looks away... considers bringing this<br>
    up, and finally gives in to the curiosity.</p>

  <p> LEAH<br>
    Commander La Forge... ever since<br>
    I came on board, there's been<br>
    something a little peculiar in<br>
    your attitude. You seem to know<br>
    things about me even though we've<br>
    never met.</p>
  <p> The choice is there for Geordi to level with her...<br>
    but it's too scary and he backs off.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I... studied you. Your writings,<br>
    your Starfleet file. I've admired<br>
    you. Your work.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I'm flattered, but...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I've looked forward to meeting<br>
    you for a long time...</p>
  <p> She's looking right at him with those grave,<br>
    intelligent eyes... they're awfully close... right on<br>
    top of each other... Geordi gets a dose of courage...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And I'd like to think -- that we<br>
    could get to be friends. Good<br>
    friends.</p>
  <p> Something gentle happens behind her eyes... a wash of<br>
    tenderness floods her... She looks at Geordi with<br>
    sweetness and compassion... seeming for a moment like<br>
    the Leah of his holodeck experience.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I thought you knew... you seem<br>
    to know everything else about<br>
    me... but Commander... if I'm<br>
    hearing what I think I am, then<br>
    you should know... I'm married.</p>
  <p> Geordi stares at her, rocked by the revelation of the<br>
    one thing that had never occurred to him.</p>

    I'm with you every day, Geordi.<br>

  <p> LEAH<br>

    I called up a replay of the<br>

    to compliment you again,<br>
    Commander... for constructing a<br>
    program which contained the<br>

    dare you use me like this? How<br>
    far did it go, anyway? Was it<br>
    good for you?</p>
  <p> She's plenty mad, but Geordi's beginning to get angry,<br>
    too. She's been on him since she got here, and he's<br>
    getting fed up.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Nothing like that happened. It<br>
    was a professional collaboration.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Oh, I can tell -- &quot;Every time you<br>
    touch the engine, it's me... &quot; Real<br>
    professional.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    If you watched the whole program,<br>
    you saw what it was... we worked<br>
    together to solve a problem. In<br>
    a crisis situation --</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    How do I know that's all there<br>
    was? What other programs did you<br>
    create? You could have dozens<br>
    of them, one for every day of the<br>
    week, one for every mood --</p>
  <p> That's enough. Geordi's had it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Ever since you came on board,<br>
    you've been badgering me... and<br>
    I've taken it. I've shown you<br>
    courtesy, and respect, and a hell<br>
    of a lot of patience. I've tried<br>
    to understand you and I've tried<br>
    to get along with you...</p>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And in return, you've accused me,<br>
    tried and convicted me without<br>
    bothering to hear my side of it.<br>
    So -- I'm guilty, okay? But not<br>
    of what you think... of something<br>
    much worse...</p>
  <p> She stares at him, silenced by this passionate<br>
    outpouring.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm guilty of reaching out to<br>

  <p> LEAH<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I really owe you an apology,<br>
    Geordi.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    No you don't. I should have told<br>
    you straight out...</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    (disagreeing)<br>
    But if you had, I never would've<br>
    seen the look on your face when<br>
    you walked in on me... and me...<br>
    in the holodeck...</p>

  <p>75 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The look on my face... ? The look<br>
    on your face, I'll remember that<br>
    a long time.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    I wouldn't change a thing...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Except the way I behaved... I<br>
    guess I came here with my own set<br>
    of preconceptions about you...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I'm just glad I finally got the<br>
    chance to know you... the real<br>
    you.</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    Me too.<br>
    (long beat)<br>
    Tell me... am I... really that<br>
    different than my image in the<br>
    holodeck?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (warm smile)<br>
    Not so different... not so<br>
    different at all.</p>
  <p> And here in space, far away from everything and<br>
    everyone, it isn't hard for intimacies to grow<br>
    quickly... and as they look at each other in a new way,<br>
    who knows what might happen... and then they're<br>
    interrupted by --</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Worf to La Forge... there's an<br>
    incoming message on subspace for<br>
    Doctor Brahms...</p>
  <p> And that breaks the mood real quick... as she rises...</p>
  <p> LEAH<br>
    My husband...</p>

  <p> She nods to Geordi and EXITS...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Acknowledged, Worf. La Forge<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> Geordi looks out into space and drinks from his<br>
    glass... and that's life as we...</p>
