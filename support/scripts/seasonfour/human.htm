    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship approaches a small Talarian vessel, adrift.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44085.7.<br>
    We have moved into Sector<br>
    Two-One-Nine-Four-Seven in<br>
    response to a distress call from<br>
    a Talarian observation craft.<br>
    The alien vessel appears adrift,<br>
    and our initial probe has detected<br>
    a life-threatening radiation leak<br>
    within its propulsion system.</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> To include MAIN VIEWER. PICARD, TROI, and RIKER in<br>
    the Command Chairs. DATA at Ops, WORF at Tactical,<br>
    WESLEY at Conn.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, I get no further response<br>
    from the vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Maintain an open channel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Doctor Crusher and her assistants<br>
    are waiting in Transporter Room<br>
    Three, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sir, I must remind you that during<br>
    the Galen border conflicts a<br>
    common tactic of the Talarians<br>
    was to abandon their observation<br>
    craft, rig them to<br>
    self-destruct...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    ... and issue a general distress<br>
    call, yes, I know...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    This particular guerilla maneuver<br>
    resulted in two hundred and<br>
    nineteen fatalities over a three-<br>
    year period.</p>
  <p> Picard is silent, pondering his options.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Data, is there any way to detect<br>
    their self-destruct device?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Negative, Commander. The<br>
    Talarians employ a subspace<br>
    proximity detonator. It would<br>
    not be detectable to our scans...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (joining in)<br>
    ... or the Away Team's tricorders.<br>
    Right.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Captain, the Talarian warship<br>
    Q'Maire is responding to the<br>
    distress call.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Position?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Halfway through the Woden sector.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    It'll take them hours to get here,<br>
    sir, even at maximum warp.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard turns to Troi, who has been quiet during all<br>
    this, concentrating on what forces might be emanating<br>
    from the stricken vessel.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Counselor?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There is life on board... but it's<br>
    fading.</p>
  <p> That's it. Picard makes his decision.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Number One, assemble the rest of<br>
    your away team and prepare for<br>
    immediate rescue operations.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> They lock eyes for a moment. Picard doesn't need to<br>
    add, &quot;Be careful.&quot; Riker knows all too well what he<br>
    may be heading into.</p>
  <p>3 INT. TALARIAN OBSERVATION CRAFT (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Gaseous, dark, flickering neon lights accent the area<br>
    as Riker, Worf and BEVERLY MATERIALIZE with TWO MEDICAL<br>
    SUPERNUMERARIES carrying equipment. Riker, tricorder<br>
    in hand, steps forward, wary and alert. They move into<br>
    the interior of the ship, scanning constantly with his<br>
    tricorder, the others following.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (checking tricorder)<br>
    Ancilary power is failing,<br>
    Commander.</p>
  <p> They move throught the cabin, and then spot --</p>
  <p>4 THEIR POV - AN ADJACENT AREA</p>
  <p> revealing FIVE TALARIANS, some with radiation burns,<br>
    most too weak to stand. They wear a helmet-like head<br>
    covering that is decidedly war-like in appearance, and<br>
    all wear gloves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> They all look young -- like our teen-agers.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They're nothing more than<br>
    children!</p>
  <p> And they are broken and wounded. Riker steps forward.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I am Commander Riker of the<br>
    Federation Starship Enterprise.<br>
    We will evacuate you and give you<br>
    medical care. You will not be<br>
    harmed.</p>
  <p> There is no resistance, and Beverly springs into<br>
    action, scanning the victims with a medical tricorder.<br>
    Worf move into an adjacent corridor to reconnoiter.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (keying insignia)<br>
    Enterprise, prepping five Talarian<br>
    males for transport directly to<br>
    Sickbay... Trauma Team, stand<br>
    by to receive injured... we have<br>
    radiation burns, possible<br>
    respiratory distress...</p>
  <p> TRANSPORTER OFFICER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Transport locked in and ready,<br>
    Doctor.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Stand by for my order.</p>
  <p> As she and the medical assistants continue triage,<br>
    Riker keys his insignia.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Captain, it looks like this was<br>
    a basic training ship. Five<br>
    boys... in their teens... all<br>
    in uniform...</p>
  <p> PICARD'S COM VOICE<br>
    Proceed with the evacuation,<br>
    Number One.</p>
  <p> Worf returns from his inspection.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/16/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    No other life signs on board, sir.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY'S (O.C.)<br>
    Commander! Quickly!</p>
  <p> Riker rushes to Beverly's side: she's aiming her<br>
    tricorder at a TALARIAN YOUTH, free hand removing his<br>
    helmet.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> The helmet is removed, revealing a handsome young man<br>
    of about fourteen -- looking not at all Talarian.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY (O.C.)<br>
    Look... this boy... he's human!</p>
  <p> And on their stunned reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>5 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> One critical-status Talarian is being treated for<br>
    radiation damage. Other survivors are whisked into the<br>
    ward by MEDICAL SUPERNUMERARIES.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental: We<br>
    have completed emergency<br>
    evacuation of four Talarians<br>
    -- and one human. How this young<br>
    man found himself in the custody<br>
    of these aliens remains a mystery.</p>
  <p> Across the ward, sitting cross-legged on a diagnostic<br>
    bed, is JONO -- the human. He is ramrod straight, eyes<br>
    fixed ahead, jaw clenched. With steely determination,<br>
    he avoids any effort by Beverly to make contact with<br>
    him. Troi observes.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    It's Jono, right? Is that what<br>
    I heard them call you?</p>
  <p> She speaks casually, warmly, as she scans him with her<br>
    tricorder. Jono ignores her.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm Doctor Crusher. I'm examining<br>
    you for radiation injuries. It<br>
    won't hurt.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I have a son not much older than<br>
    you. Maybe you'd like to meet<br>
    him.</p>
  <p> No response.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (gamely)<br>
    Well, Jono... you seem to have<br>
    escaped radiation damage. Pretty<br>
    lucky.<br>
    (reacting to something<br>
    on the tricorder)<br>
    How did this happen -- ?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/25/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly, Jono covers his face and emits a high-pitched<br>
    shriek -- a keening -- and begins rocking back and<br>
    forth. Other Talarians, like babies responding with<br>
    sympathetic crying, take up the awful screech.<br>
    Startled, Beverly moves away from the boy.<br>
    Instinctively, Troi moves forward, toward him.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What is it?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He's -- terrified.</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>6A INT. SICKBAY - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Picard and Riker ENTER; Beverly approaches them.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    They all just started up,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>6A CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A roomful of shrieking teenagers does not sit well with<br>
    Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    May I have your attention, please?</p>
  <p> They continue the keening sound.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Please -- may I have your<br>
    attention?</p>
  <p> No response. Finally, frustrated, Picard walks toward<br>
    Jono.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Stop that immediately!</p>
  <p> The unmistakable voice of authority gets Jono's<br>
    attention instantly. He breaks off in mid-cry, turns<br>
    and stares at Picard in a mixture of awe and respect.<br>
    The others stop the screech as soon as Jono does.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. That's better. Now, what's<br>
    your name, young man?</p>
  <p> Jono blinks, but doesn't answer.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He won't talk, Captain. We<br>
    haven't been able to get through<br>
    to him.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Captain -- ?</p>
  <p> Electrified by that word, Jono jumps off the bed and<br>
    crosses to Picard, bows his head.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Captain... I am Jono. Take me<br>
    home, to my Captain. Take me home<br>
    to Endar!</p>
  <p> Picard stares awkwardly down at the young man at his<br>
    feet. Then he looks up at Troi, who has observed this<br>
    little scene. She is smiling slightly. Picard has<br>
    made an instant connection with this troubled boy.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/25/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>7 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS with Beverly.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He managed to escape radiation<br>
    trauma... but his scans showed<br>
    something else...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> Beverly rises, paces. She is disturbed by what she has<br>
    to say.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Two previously fractured ribs...<br>
    a broken arm... a low-grade<br>
    concussion. There may be<br>
    neurological impairment... I'll<br>
    have to examine him further. Jean<br>
    Luc -- the Talarians have always<br>
    been ruthless to their enemies...<br>
    I think there's a real possibility<br>
    they may have brutalized the<br>
    child.</p>
  <p> Picard is appalled, but wants, as always, to consider<br>
    all possibilities.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Isn't it possible he was injured<br>
    prior to his captivity?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not likely. He's been with them<br>
    a long time... long enough to<br>
    assimilate their cultural<br>
    traits... and calcium trace<br>
    patterns indicate the injuries<br>
    occurred during the past seven<br>
    years.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (frowns)<br>
    But if they have... abused the<br>
    boy... why would he devoutly wish<br>
    to return to them?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    That's not uncommon. It was<br>
    identified centuries ago as the<br>
    &quot;Stockholm syndrome.&quot;</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>7 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Suddenly, there is commotion from the Sickbay and as<br>
    Picard and Beverly react...</p>
  <p>8 INT. SICKBAY - JONO - THEIR POV</p>
  <p> He is thrashing on the bed, resisting the efforts of<br>
    two medical SUPERNUMERARIES and Troi to restrain him.<br>
    Then, he bursts into that dreadful shriek. The other<br>
    Talarians follow suit.</p>
  <p>9 ON PICARD AND BEVERLY</p>
  <p> as they rush from the office.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Now what?</p>
  <p> Jono has leapt from the table and is tearing around the<br>
    room, shrieking.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I suggested he take off his<br>
    gloves... Suddenly he went out<br>
    of control.</p>
  <p> The medical personnel are still scrambling to grab<br>
    Jono.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (hits insignia)<br>
    Security, we need some assistance<br>
    in Sickbay...</p>
  <p> WORF'S COM VOICE<br>
    Acknowledged, Doctor.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono -- !</p>
  <p> Seeing Picard, Jono stops shrieking, but keeps dancing<br>
    away from his pursuers, agitated and hyperventilating.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    She won't leave me alone! She<br>
    keeps trying to dissect me!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    She was trying to help you!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I don't want her help! All I want<br>
    is to be with my brothers! Send<br>
    us back to Captain Endar!</p>
  <p> Jono may be confused, and he may have suffered, but at<br>
    the moment he's a child throwing a tantrum. Worf<br>
    ENTERS, takes in the scene... begins to move at Jono...<br>
    Picard wants to de-escalate the incident...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono -- I want you to stop this<br>
    immediately!</p>
  <p> Jono stops short, responding almost involuntarily to<br>
    the voice of authority. He lifts his head, then bows<br>
    it again to Picard.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Yes, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    That's better. Now, if we're to<br>
    accomplish anything --</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Data to Picard.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> DATA'S COM VOICE<br>
    We have received a subspace<br>
    communique from Starfleet Command,<br>
    regarding the young human, sir.</p>
  <p> Jono's eyes flicker at this, but he does not move.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Doctor, Counselor...<br>
    (join me)</p>
  <p> Moving with Picard --</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Mister Worf, escort this young<br>
    man to quarters... he's to be<br>
    confined there until further<br>
    notice.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/24/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>9 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes, Doctor.</p>
  <p> Jono has listened to this interchange with interest. A<br>
    beat as the boy and the Klingon measure one another.</p>
  <p>10 OMITTED</p>
  <p>10A INT. N.D. QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Worf and Jono ENTER.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Why are you here, Klingon -- with<br>
    them? Did they capture you, too?</p>

    males can.</p>
  <p> Jono stares at him, clear-eyed and sure.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I am not human any more than you<br>
    are. I am Talarian.</p>
  <p> Worf regards the boy with sadness, understanding his<br>
    plight perhaps better than anyone.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    You are confused...</p>
  <p> Suddenly, the boy launches into that ear-splitting wail<br>
    again, jarring Worf from his sympathy.</p>

    Rossa...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> DATA<br>
    She is his grandmother, Captain.</p>
  <p> Riker whistles softly. Data calls up a still picture<br>
    of the child with his parents on the monitor.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He was born fourteen years ago<br>
    on the Federation Colony, Galen<br>
    Four. His parents, Connor and<br>
    Moira Rossa, were killed in a<br>
    border skirmish three years, nine<br>
    months later when the colony was<br>
    overrun by Talarian forces.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Captain... if Jeremiah were<br>

    present condition... it would be<br>
    a wrenching experience for<br>
    everyone. Especially for him.<br>
    He needs to re-discover his<br>

    connection with his roots.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I agree. Please take whatever<br>

    it should be you, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (over my dead body)<br>
    Oh, no, Counselor! I don't think<br>
    so. He needs someone who is --<br>
    trained in these things.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    But you are the only person on<br>

    are the only one who can help him.<br>

  <p>14 INT. N.D. LIVING QUARTERS - A LITTLE LATER</p>
  <p> Jono sits cross-legged, his high-pitched wail now<br>
    having achieved a ritualistic, mournful rhythm. He<br>
    keeps at it, indefatigably, then suddenly breaks off as<br>
    he sees --</p>
  <p>15 PICARD</p>
  <p> who stands at the door, observing him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono... why do you make that<br>
    noise?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    It is the custom of my people when<br>
    they are in distress.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is it not also the custom of your<br>
    people to listen to the wishes<br>
    of their Captain?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Yes.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then, as Captain of the Starship<br>
    Enterprise, I ask you not to make<br>
    that sound.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    (nodding, obedient)<br>
    Yes, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Good. Well. Now that we have<br>
    that cleared up...<br>
    (tries to look cheerful)<br>
    Let's... get acquainted, shall<br>
    we?</p>
  <p> Jono stares up at him, puzzled, and Picard smiles with<br>
    what he hopes is sincerity.</p>

  <p> He trails off as Jono looks around the room, silently<br>
    inspecting it. Then he turns to Picard.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    This is a cage. I am still your<br>
    captive.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not at all. I thought you would<br>
    be comfortable here --</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Are you going to return me to my<br>
    Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (temporizing)<br>
    We will rendezvous with the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    We will... discuss... your<br>

  <p> Jono eyes him briefly, then swings around to look at<br>
    the living quarters.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I don't like this place.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well, we can find other quarters.<br>

  <p>17 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> The door opens and Picard and Jono ENTER.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you'll see... there's<br>
    nothing here that would appeal<br>
    to a young person.</p>
  <p> Picard watches as Jono wanders the room, picking up<br>
    things and putting them down in typical teen-age<br>
    fashion. He picks up a Klingon dagger, inspects it<br>
    curiously, turning it in his gloved hands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put that down, please.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    It's Klingon.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes. Put it back where you got<br>
    it.</p>
  <p> Jono flips the dagger onto the desk, flops down into<br>
    a chair, sprawling. Picard places it exactly as it<br>
    was before. Then he turns toward the boy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Well. Here we are, eh, Jono?</p>
  <p> Jono stares at him, not replying. Picard sits, trying<br>
    to make conversation.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I notice you haven't taken off<br>
    your gloves...</p>
  <p> Jono sits straight, protectively puts his hands to his<br>
    sides.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Not here.</p>

  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Why not?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    So that I don't have to touch an<br>
    alien.</p>
  <p> Picard reacts. A beat. He leans toward the boy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono... your Captain, Endar? Has<br>
    he ever hurt you?<br>
    (off Jono)<br>
    Inflicted pain?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    (proudly)<br>
    Pain is not a consideration.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then he has.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I did not say that. Can't you<br>
    understand? Pain is not what<br>
    matters. Passing the tests is<br>
    everything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Is that what they are? Tests of<br>
    pain?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    (scornful)<br>
    You don't understand anything.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It's true I don't fully understand<br>
    Talarians. But... you are not<br>
    Talarian.</p>
  <p> At this, Jono stiffens and jumps to his feet.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I will not listen to this! I will<br>
    not listen to your lies! Take<br>
    me back to my cell! I'd rather<br>
    be in prison than have you try<br>
    to poison my mind!</p>
  <p> Picard sighs. This task is impossible.</p>

  <p>18 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - LATER</p>
  <p> Picard sits, musing, distressed. The SOUND OF A CHIME.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Come.</p>
  <p> The door opens and Troi stands there.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You wanted to see me, Captain?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ah, yes, Counselor. Please --<br>
    sit down.</p>
  <p> Troi sits opposite him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You may not be aware of this, but<br>
    I have never been particularly<br>
    comfortable around children.</p>
  <p> To Troi's credit, she does not laugh.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Really?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    For some reason, they just don't<br>
    seem to respond to me.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Frankly, I think my time is best<br>
    served carrying out the duties<br>
    and responsibilities of a<br>
    Starfleet Captain.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Seldom have I heard an explanation<br>
    so well rehearsed.</p>
  <p> He shoots her a look; she smiles.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    All right, Counselor... I just<br>
    don't think I'm the right person<br>
    for this job.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Strange, isn't it? You'll travel<br>
    light years, dodge asteroid<br>
    storms, brave hostile aliens...<br>
    but when asked to assume a<br>
    parental role, you cringe. Why<br>
    do you suppose that is?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm not cringing... I am simply<br>
    acknowledging my limitations.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (musing)<br>
    When you were a child, did you<br>
    have many friends? Other children<br>
    you played with?</p>
  <p> Picard shifts; he's not entirely comfortable being<br>
    probed.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    No, but I don't think that has<br>
    anything to do with anything...<br>
    (beat, pondering)<br>
    Perhaps it's because... no, this<br>
    is foolish. What does it matter?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    What were you going to say?</p>
  <p> Picard hesitates; this is not easy territory for him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Just that... ever since I was a<br>
    child... I knew exactly what I<br>
    wanted -- to be a member of<br>
    Starfleet. Nothing else mattered<br>
    to me. Virtually my entire youth<br>
    was spent pursuing that goal.<br>
    In fact...<br>

  <p> Picard sighs. No getting off the hook here.</p>
  <p>19 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> Picard approaches his quarters, carrying a portable<br>
    visual monitor; as he does, he hears the muffled sound<br>
    of noise from within: a maelstrom of electronic sound,<br>
    discordant and unstructured. Puzzled, he opens his<br>
    door. The sound blasts forth, deafening.</p>
  <p>20 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS</p>
  <p> The volume of the noise is truly frightening. Picard<br>
    looks around his room, noting that the furniture has<br>
    been completely re-arranged.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, turn off that noise!</p>
  <p> Instantly, there is blissful silence.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Computer, what was that?</p>
  <p> COMPUTER'S VOICE<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono? Where are you?</p>
  <p> JONO'S VOICE<br>
    Here.</p>
  <p> Drawn by the voice, Picard looks up, and discovers Jono<br>
    suspended from the ceiling in a spider-web hammock.</p>

    Yes, I certainly did, and I expect<br>

    I cannot rest on your beds. They<br>
    hurt my back.</p>
  <p> Exasperated, Picard starts to reply, then stops<br>
    himself. Nothing to be served by antagonizing him. He's<br>
    going to try to do this thing as best he can.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Right... Jono, I want to show you<br>
    something.</p>

  <p> He EXITS. Jono watches him leave, and then, almost<br>
    against his will, as though being drawn by unseen<br>
    forces, he turns back to the monitor. He moves to it,<br>
    stares at a picture of his parents. His hand reaches<br>
    toward the image of his mother. Softly, SOUNDS begin<br>
    building in his head -- the zap of phaser fire, and<br>
    then a woman's voice, calling.</p>

    discovered a human among your<br>
    crew.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    (visibly relieved)<br>
    Jono!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Actually, his name is Jeremiah<br>
    -- Jeremiah Rossa.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    What is his condition? Is he<br>
    injured?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He was not wounded in the<br>
    mishap...</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    A blessing...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    But as a representative of the<br>
    Federation I demand an<br>
    explanation. Why has this child<br>
    been held in your custody all<br>
    these years?</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    No explanation is warranted,<br>
    Captain. He is my son!</p>
  <p> Off Picard and Riker's astonishment:</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT TWO </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT THREE 28.</p>
  <p> ACT THREE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>23 EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND Q'MAIRE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Both ships hold positions facing one another.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, supplemental:<br>
    Endar's claim that Jeremiah Rossa<br>
    is his son is clearly<br>
    unacceptable.</p>
  <p>24 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Endar and TWO TALARIAN MILITIA MATERIALIZE, and greet<br>
    Riker and Worf.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    However, to avoid escalating<br>
    tensions, I have extended an<br>
    invitation to the Talarian leader<br>
    to come aboard the Enterprise so<br>
    that we may address the issue<br>
    face-to-face.</p>
  <p>25 INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard with Endar.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Yes... I was in charge of the<br>
    force that repelled the<br>
    trespassers on Galen Four.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I must say your Federation troops<br>
    fought tenaciously.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Among them Connor and Moira Rossa.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    I suppose. After the battle, I<br>
    found this squalling child,<br>
    huddled by the body of a young<br>
    woman. His mother, presumably.</p>
  <p> An awful image. Picard is stirred.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT THREE 29.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And so, you -- kidnapped him.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    A harsh term, Captain. I rescued<br>
    the child. There was almost no<br>
    one left alive on Galen Four...<br>
    was I to leave him screaming by<br>
    his mother's body?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You should have notified<br>
    Federation authorities. To<br>
    conceal him was a clear violation<br>
    of our agreement.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    I took him in accordance with<br>
    my peoples' traditions.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    What... tradition... is it that<br>
    empowered you to capture a<br>
    helpless child?</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    I lost my son at the hands of<br>
    humans during the conflict over<br>
    Castal One. Talarian custom<br>
    allows me to claim the son of a<br>
    slain enemy.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (weighing this)<br>
    I understand your tradition,<br>
    Endar. May I ask... does it<br>
    extend also to brutalizing the<br>
    surrogate son?</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    What are you talking about?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Our medical officer found evidence<br>
    of injuries so severe that they<br>
    might even be considered<br>
    torture...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT THREE 29A.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    No! I have never harmed Jono!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT THREE 30.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then explain the fractured ribs!<br>
    The concussion... the broken<br>
    arm...</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Youth.</p>
  <p> The simplicity of this answer catches Picard.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Have you ever been a father,<br>
    Picard? Have you ever had a son<br>
    desperately try to win your<br>
    approval? Your respect?</p>
  <p> Picard ponders this.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Jono broke his ribs riding a<br>
    T'stayan -- six hooves, a very<br>
    powerful animal. The arm? In<br>
    a contest with other youths. He<br>
    endured the pain -- and won the<br>
    competition.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He will be a great warrior one<br>
    day.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Doesn't he deserve to become more<br>
    than that?</p>
  <p> Picard rises, pacing.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    His heritage is human, Endar.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    A heritage long since forgotten.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (an inner decision made)<br>
    Captain Endar, while on board,<br>
    you are welcome to supervise the<br>
    return of your crew. But I cannot<br>
    allow Jeremiah Rossa to be<br>
    returned to your custody. His<br>
    true family is waiting for him<br>
    on Earth.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT THREE 31.</p>
  <p>25 CONTINUED: (4)</p>
  <p> Endar rises, too, a buried rage burning from his eyes.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Then under no circumstances will<br>
    I allow your ship to leave our<br>
    territory.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I have already reported our<br>
    position and the nature of this<br>
    violation to Starfleet.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    And I have already called our<br>
    reserved forces into the sector.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (amazed)<br>
    Are you saying you would be<br>
    willing to go to war over the boy?</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Would you not for your only son?</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him. He realizes they are on the<br>
    brink of catastrophe.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    We have been at peace for years.<br>
    Let us not rush headlong toward<br>
    war.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Then help me to avoid it!<br>
    (beat)<br>
    If you will allow me to see Jono,<br>
    it will be clear to you -- I have<br>
    been a good father. He has grown<br>
    up happy in my keeping.</p>
  <p> Picard turns away, his mind roiling. What is the right<br>
    decision? Is there a right decision?</p>
  <p>26 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Jono still sits in front of the monitor, flipping<br>
    through the various photographs, over and over. Troi<br>
    is with him.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>

  <p>26 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    That was long ago. Endar is my<br>
    father.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And who is your mother?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    We don't have mothers. Females<br>
    are only for mating. And work.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And the men? What is their<br>
    purpose?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Passing the tests. Becoming<br>
    strong.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    The tests... endurance, pain,<br>
    determination... all so that you<br>
    can excel at making war?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    (scornful)<br>
    Females understand nothing.<br>
    (puts his face in hers)<br>
    Life is not easy on our planet.<br>
    If we do not test ourselves<br>
    constantly, we become weak -- and<br>
    the weak die quickly!</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And the females? Surely they are<br>
    weak.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Of course. But we protect them.</p>
  <p> He looks at her, fierce male pride burning in his eyes.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I see.</p>
  <p> Her gaze shifts toward the monitor, and Jono's look<br>
    follows.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And when you look at this<br>
    picture... of you and the human<br>
    female who was your mother...<br>
    how do you feel about her?</p>

  <p>27 OMITTED</p>
  <p>28 INSERT - MONITOR SCREEN (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Moira Rossa holds her infant son, who snuggles securely<br>
    at her breast. His tiny fingers are clasped around one<br>
    of her fingers, and she is smiling at him with<br>
    unashamed adoration. His baby smile returns that<br>
    unqualified love.</p>
  <p>29 JONO</p>
  <p> tears his eyes from the screen, agitated and disturbed.</p>
  <p>30 OMITTED</p>
  <p>31 INT. BEVERLY'S OFFICE</p>
  <p> Picard is with Beverly and Troi.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then you think it would be unwise<br>
    to let Endar see Jono.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I think it's dangerous. Abusers<br>
    can have subtle but powerful<br>
    influence over their victims.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I'm not convinced he was abused,<br>
    Doctor. I've talked to the man,<br>
    and if I am any judge of<br>
    character... I'd say he deeply<br>
    cares about the boy's welfare.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Captain, we learned long ago<br>
    always to err on the side of<br>
    protecting the child. I think<br>
    Endar should be kept away from<br>
    Jono.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm not sure I agree, Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/13/90 - ACT THREE 34.</p>
  <p>31 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Picard looks to her...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I sense... awakening memories in<br>
    the boy... this is a very fragile<br>
    time for Jono, and if we send away<br>
    the man he calls &quot;father&quot; without<br>
    even letting them see each other<br>
    -- how will we ever gain his<br>
    trust?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Yes... There is also something<br>
    else we should keep in mind. We<br>
    are deep in Talarian territory.<br>
    A semblance of diplomacy is called<br>
    for.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I shall allow the visit.</p>
  <p> Beverly doesn't agree, but she understands.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All I ask... is that the visit<br>
    be supervised. Don't let them<br>
    be alone together.</p>
  <p> Picard considers, nods.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Agreed.</p>
  <p> He EXITS toward Endar.</p>
  <p>32 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE - LATER</p>
  <p> Troi sits with Endar; they look up as the doors slide<br>
    open. Picard ENTERS with Jono, who spots his &quot;father&quot;<br>
    and rushes forward.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Endar!</p>
  <p> He bows his head to the Talarian Captain, just as he<br>
    did with Picard. Endar extends his arms and Jono comes<br>
    to him; then the two gently press their foreheads<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Jono... my son...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - 7/9/90 - ACT THREE 35.</p>
  <p>32 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Their eyes close as they rock gently, heads pressed<br>
    together.</p>
  <p>33 PICARD AND TROI</p>
  <p> silently observing this moment of alien affection.<br>
    They withdraw to a corner of the room so as not to<br>
    intrude. They cannot hear Endar and Jono clearly.</p>
  <p>34 RESUME ENDAR AND JONO</p>
  <p> They separate, Endar finding it difficult to hide<br>
    concern. They sit, and speak in hushed voices, huddled<br>
    together.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Have they treated you well?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Yes, Captain. Except...</p>
  <p> His eyes flicker over toward Picard.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Except?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I was forbidden to make the<br>
    B'Nar.</p>
  <p> Endar's gaze darts toward Picard, also, but he doesn't<br>
    seem too distressed by this &quot;atrocity.&quot;</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    It's all right. I know that you<br>
    mourned in your heart.<br>
    (eyeing Jono)<br>
    Well, Jono... what do you think<br>
    of these humans?</p>
  <p> It's a charged question, and Jono hesitates, glances<br>
    down, lifts his eyes again.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    They... they look like me.</p>
  <p> This troubles Endar, and he leans forward.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    They want to keep you, you know.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - 7/9/90 - ACT THREE 36.</p>
  <p>34 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    You are of the age of decision.<br>
    What is your choice?</p>
  <p> Jono hesitates again, and Endar frowns. The boy is<br>
    having a surprisingly difficult time with this.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Well? Do you want to stay?</p>
  <p> All children tend to tell their parents what they want<br>
    to hear, and Jono is no exception.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    No, of course not.</p>
  <p> And all parents want to believe their children when<br>
    they say the comfortable thing.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    Then you shall not.<br>
    (rising)<br>
    I am going back to the Q'Maire.<br>
    I will leave the humans with a<br>
    choice. If they do not make the<br>
    one we know is right... it may<br>
    lead to war.</p>
  <p> Endar again presses his forehead to Jono's.</p>
  <p> ENDAR<br>
    You may die.</p>
  <p> Again, the slightest hesitation, before --</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I am ready to die.</p>
  <p> And as Endar and Jono stand together in the fleeting<br>
    comfort of a shared lie --</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Talarian warships are limited to<br>

    merculite rockets. No match for<br>
    the Enterprise, Captain.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The last thing I want is to be<br>
    forced into destroying one of<br>
    their ships.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    The lines are being drawn... all<br>
    this for a chosen son.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Is it worth it, Captain? To go<br>
    to war -- over a child?</p>
  <p> Picard shoots him a glance.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>
    If we can just reach Jono... help<br>
    him to make some connection with<br>
    his origins... then he may choose<br>

    their own choices.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

  <p> Jono, overwhelmed, rises and begins pacing, agitated.</p>

    to hold still much longer I will<br>
    die!</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono -- let me show you what I<br>

  <p> Jono looks at him, curiosity aroused.</p>
  <p>37 INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - LATER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Picard is with Jono, giving him basic instruction in<br>
    the game. It has changed over the centuries in about<br>
    the way that tennis, say, changed from Henry VIII's<br>
    day to the present. The basic principles are the same;<br>
    the racquet is different -- sleeker, more streamlined<br>
    -- and the ball is electronic: perhaps it glows from<br>
    within. Most important, when it is hit, or hits a<br>
    wall, there is an ELECTRONIC SOUND -- something that<br>
    will begin to sound not unlike a phaser.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (demonstrating)<br>
    I serve from here... like this...<br>
    (serves)<br>
    And you must hit it back before<br>
    it bounces twice. Let's try it.</p>
  <p> Picard lobs an easy serve into Jono's forehand; the<br>
    boy with unerring instinct hits a kill shot about a<br>
    foot off the ground. Picard turns to look at him.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Not bad.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I win at all the games.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I can believe it. Well, shall<br>
    we give this a try?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/16/90 - ACT FOUR 42.</p>
  <p>38 SERIES OF SHOTS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> as Picard and Jono ENTER into a rousing and<br>
    surprisingly close game. Jono has natural ability and<br>
    the resilience of youth, and gives Picard a run for it.<br>
    The electronic ZAP of the ball as it ricochets around<br>
    the court becomes louder and louder, and gradually its<br>
    presence changes, sounding more and more like a weapon.</p>
  <p>39 JONO (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> reacts to this, shaking his head as though to clear it.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono? You all right?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Fine.</p>
  <p> He serves and they ENTER into a long rally... the<br>
    SOUNDS becoming louder, now mixed with more sounds of<br>
    WARFARE -- muffled explosions, people shouting, the<br>
    rapid sound of phaser fire. Then, the sound of voices<br>
    --</p>
  <p> CONNOR'S VOICE<br>
    Take him and get to cover!</p>
  <p> MOIRA'S VOICE<br>
    I can't leave you!</p>
  <p> Jono stops, face twisted in anguish. He covers his<br>
    ears, tries to blot out the sound. He will murmur,<br>
    &quot;No, no... &quot; softly through the rest. Picard's voice<br>
    will echo as though it's coming from far away.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono -- what is it?!</p>
  <p> Jono flails on the ground as the vortex of sound<br>
    increases.</p>
  <p> CONNOR'S VOICE<br>
    Take Jeremiah... get to the<br>
    forest! I'll hold them off!</p>
  <p> MOIRA'S VOICE<br>
    No, come with us!</p>
  <p> CONNOR'S VOICE<br>
    Go!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/19/90 - ACT FOUR 43.</p>
  <p>39 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Rapid sound of PHASERS, now, and many shouting voices,<br>
    explosions. We hear a child's voice... &quot;Mama...<br>
    mama... &quot;</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    (barely audible)<br>
    Mama...</p>
  <p> MOIRA'S VOICE<br>
    Jeremiah... Jeremiah... This way!</p>
  <p> A sudden explosion, louder than the rest, and a woman's<br>
    dreadful scream. Jono sinks to the ground, head buried<br>
    in his hands. The child's voice begins to cry in<br>
    terror, calling out, &quot;Mama... mama... mama... &quot;</p>
  <p>40 PICARD AND JONO</p>
  <p> as the sounds begin to fade. Picard kneels with him,<br>
    puts his arm around the shaking boy's shoulders. Jono<br>
    looks up at him, his face wet with tears.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    She was... all red. I cried...<br>
    but she didn't answer me...</p>
  <p> The boy breaks into sobs again and buries his head.<br>
    Picard rubs his shoulder. He's not sure just what he<br>
    should be doing, but he does know that an important<br>
    breakthrough has been made.</p>
  <p>41 INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS - LATER</p>
  <p> Jono sits talking with Picard. They are still in<br>
    racquetball clothes. Jono is subdued, but talks<br>
    freely.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    ... she used to sing to me... I<br>
    don't remember the melody, just<br>
    the sound of her voice...</p>
  <p> He stops, shakes his head.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Before I remembered these things,<br>
    I was strong. Now...<br>
    (touches his chest)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/16/90 - ACT FOUR 44.</p>
  <p>41 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> The boy draws a deep breath.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I have endured much pain. But<br>
    this... I do not like.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    It is part of being human, Jono.<br>
    But as deeply as you can feel hurt<br>
    -- you can also feel joy.</p>
  <p> Jono looks up at him, sadly.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I do not think so. I think I will<br>
    always feel like this.</p>
  <p> Picard is not sure where to go from here.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono -- are you tired?</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Yes. But I do not want to rest.<br>
    I think --<br>
    (looks up, almost<br>
    surprised)<br>
    -- I think I am hungry.</p>
  <p>42 INT. TEN FORWARD - MINUTES LATER</p>
  <p> Picard ENTERS with Jono, now both showered and<br>
    dressed. Picard spots Riker at a table with Wesley<br>
    and Data, steers the boy toward them.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, how was racquetball?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    He gave me quite a game for his<br>
    first time out.</p>
  <p> The flicker of a smile -- the first we've seen -- plays<br>
    on Jono's lips. He is much more relaxed now, as though<br>
    a great burden has fallen away.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    I look forward to the next time,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/16/90 - ACT FOUR 45.</p>
  <p>42 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard grins, glad that Jono's cockiness is returning.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    I'm sure you do. sit down, Jono.<br>
    What would you like?</p>
  <p> Jono and Picard sit. Jono looks around at the table,<br>
    points to Wesley's banana split.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    What's that?</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    That's called a banana split and<br>
    it's maybe the best thing there<br>
    is in the universe.<br>
    (pushes it forward)<br>
    Here -- give it a try.</p>
  <p> Jono stares at it for a second, unsure how to attack<br>
    it. Riker slides a spoon toward him. Jono looks<br>
    puzzled.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is called a spoon.</p>
  <p> Jono nods, grabs the spoon, looks up at them<br>
    questioningly.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Go ahead.</p>
  <p> Jono is holding the spoon in his fist, like a knife.<br>
    Having received permission, he holds it over the banana<br>
    split &quot;boat&quot; -- and then jabs down into it with all<br>
    his force! This flips the opposite end of the &quot;boat&quot;<br>
    up, flinging the contents out and right toward Wesley!</p>

  <p> has a spattering of whipped cream on his face and<br>
    chest.</p>
  <p>43 OMITTED</p>

  <p> Jono stares at him, at first shocked at what he has<br>
    done.</p>

  <p>44 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Forgive me --</p>
  <p> He glances around the table and sees Picard smiling --<br>
    and Riker trying to hold in a laugh. Finally Riker<br>
    can't help it and he snorts with laughter. Wesley<br>
    starts laughing. Then Jono looks back at Wesley and<br>
    then he bursts into laughter.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I fail to see why this is amusing.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (still chuckling)<br>
    Check your data banks on humor...<br>
    subheading &quot;Slapstick&quot;...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (inspecting Wesley)<br>
    Comedy stressing farce and<br>
    horseplay... ah, this no doubt<br>
    is a variation on... &quot;Pie in the<br>
    Face&quot;...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Now do you see why it's funny?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No, I do not. But I will take<br>
    your word. It is very amusing.</p>
  <p> Jono is still giggling. Wesley summons a waitress.</p>
  <p> WESLEY<br>
    Let's start over. A fresh banana<br>
    split for me, one for my friend<br>
    here.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Suddenly Human&quot; - REV. 7/18/90 - ACT FOUR 47.</p>
  <p>44A ON PICARD AND RIKER</p>
  <p> as they move off to the side, Jono, Wesley, and Data<br>
    remain at the table.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Look at him. He's like a<br>
    different person.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Who would ever have thought he<br>
    could laugh out loud like that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    And half an hour ago he was crying<br>
    in my arms like a baby.</p>
  <p> Riker, not having realized this, looks at Picard in<br>
    surprise and awe. Picard smiles, feeling content that<br>
    things are going to work out just fine.</p>

  <p> The rooms are darkened, but we can see Jono, resting in<br>
    his ceiling hammock. His eyes are open. He stares<br>
    into the darkness for a few beats, and then he lifts<br>
    up, descends from the ceiling.</p>
  <p>47 INT. CAPTAIN'S BEDROOM</p>
  <p> Picard is asleep. Jono ENTERS, approaches Picard like<br>
    a thief in the night. He gazes down at the sleeping<br>
    Captain, struggling with his emotions.</p>
  <p>48 CLOSE ON PICARD AND JONO</p>
  <p> Picard is groggy, but recognizing Jono, gives him a<br>
    smile. Jono returns the smile -- then loses the smile<br>
    to a terror within.</p>

  <p>49 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Picard is on a bed with Beverly scanning him. Picard<br>
    is unconscious and pale.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Two bleeders... single-plane<br>
    penetration...<br>
    (calling out)<br>
    I need the autosuture over here!</p>
  <p> Assistants move swiftly as she keeps scanning.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    It looks like the blade hit the<br>
    sternum and was deflected... it<br>
    could have been a lot worse.</p>
  <p>50 ON PICARD</p>
  <p> as he stirs, eyes fluttering open and sees Beverly, who<br>
    has the autosuture and is using it on him. Picard<br>
    looks around as though coming out of a fog, trying to<br>
    get his bearings.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Then it wasn't a dream...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I'm afraid not...</p>
  <p> Beverly is using the autosuture to stop the bleeding<br>
    and repair damaged tissue.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    No vital organs were pierced...<br>
    no major arteries...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Where is the boy now?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Worf has him in security. Hold<br>

    I do not accept that decision.<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    I think it does. It matters to<br>
    me.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    What matters is that I have<br>
    attacked a Captain. I am ready<br>
    to be put to death.</p>
  <p> Picard stares at him. Does he believe that?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You think you are to be killed?</p>
  <p> Jono's eyes flicker toward him, briefly.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    To attack a superior is the worst<br>
    offense. I will die at your<br>
    hands.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Jono, you aren't going to die at<br>
    my hands or anyone else's.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>

    running along the river... playing<br>
    in the games... sharing victory<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    (silencing hand)<br>
    There was a crime committed on<br>

    Jono's -- it was mine.</p>
  <p> Puzzled, Endar waits to hear what Picard means.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    When we found Jono, it seemed<br>
    so clear what had to be done.<br>
    We knew if he could only be<br>
    persuaded to make the decision<br>
    to stay... you would most likely<br>
    let him. So with the best of<br>
    intentions, we tried to convince<br>
    him... and, in so doing,<br>
    thoroughly failed to listen...<br>
    to his feelings, his needs.</p>
  <p> Jono is staring at Picard, hanging on his every word.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    That was the crime, and it has<br>
    taken a huge toll on a strong<br>
    and noble young man. It must be<br>
    rectified.</p>
  <p> Picard looks around the bridge, where he has everyone's<br>
    rapt attention.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>

    Goodbye, Jono.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>
    Goodbye, Captain.</p>
  <p> Jono starts for the platform, stops, turns, walks back<br>
    to Picard. He hesitates, then removes his gloves.<br>
    Stepping forward, he takes gentle hold of Picard's<br>
    head, tilting it down until their foreheads are pressed<br>
    together in affection and solidarity.</p>
  <p> JONO<br>

    to its former orderliness.</p>
