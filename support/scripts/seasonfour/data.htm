    &quot;Data's Day&quot; <br>
    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship stopped in space.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Second Officer's Personal Log:<br>
    Stardate 44390.1 Record entry<br>
    for transmission to Commander<br>
    Bruce Maddox, Cybernetics<br>
    Division, Daystrom Institute.<br>
    Dear Commander Maddox,...</p>
  <p>2 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> SUPERNUMERARIES at Con, Ops, and Tactical. Data is<br>
    near the aft stations, making a visual check of the<br>
    consoles. This is the &quot;nightshift&quot; and so lighting on<br>
    the Bridge should be SLIGHTLY DARKER than we're used to<br>
    seeing..</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    In reference to your most recent<br>
    letter, I agree that your study<br>
    lacks sufficient primary source<br>
    information on my programming.<br>
    Therefore in response to your<br>
    request, this correspondence will<br>
    include a complete record of my<br>
    activities during a normal day,<br>
    focusing on my perceptions of<br>
    friendship.</p>
  <p> Data moves to Command, sits down and checks a few<br>
    readings on the small monitors on the command chair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER, and THREE SUPERNUMERARIES ENTER from Turbolift.<br>
    Data stands.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Good morning, Commander. You are<br>
    fifteen minutes early.</p>
  <p> Riker smiles... he's in a very good mood.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Well, it's a special day. I<br>
    thought the... father of the bride<br>
    would enjoy being relieved a<br>
    little early on the wedding day.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Nervous?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I cannot become nervous. However,<br>
    I do sense a certain...<br>
    anticipation regarding my role<br>
    in the wedding.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    All systems normal, sir. Sickbay<br>
    reported that Lieutenant Juarez<br>
    went into labor at zero four<br>
    hundred hours. We remain on<br>
    station awaiting the arrival of<br>
    the starship Zhukov and guest<br>
    quarters have been prepared for<br>
    Ambassador T'Pel.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Very well. I have the Bridge.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Begin day watch.</p>
  <p> In response to his command, the LIGHTS begin to<br>
    BRIGHTEN, signalling the beginning of &quot;day&quot; on the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Data's people leave their positions and Riker's people<br>
    take the vacant stations.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (over above action)<br>
    Initially Commander Maddox, I<br>
    found it difficult to maintain<br>
    friendships since human emotions<br>
    are often puzzling to me.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>2A INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS from Turbolift and moves to Keiko's<br>
    Quarters.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing over above<br>
    action)<br>
    Eventually, I developed a program<br>
    enabling me to predict human<br>
    emotional responses to specific<br>
    actions.</p>
  <p> Data has arrived at the door.</p>
  <p>2B INT. KEIKO'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> KEIKO ISHIKAWA, a slender young woman of Japanese<br>
    descent and wearing civilian clothes, is walking from<br>
    the bedroom to the living area. She seems serene...<br>
    calm. The door CHIMES.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Come in.</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It is time for the wedding<br>
    rehearsal.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (flat)<br>
    I know...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I've decided not to go through<br>
    with it, Data.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - TEASER 3A.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Keiko says this with a detached air... she's<br>
    intentionally distancing herself from her emotions<br>
    right now. As a way of dealing with the pain of the<br>
    situation, she's opted to take the 'super-rational'<br>
    approach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>2B CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You do not wish to rehearse?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    No, I'm... calling off the<br>
    wedding.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    May I ask why?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It's just the right thing to do.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have your feelings for Chief<br>
    O'Brien changed?</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    (beat, calm)<br>
    I'm supposed to be getting<br>
    married, Data. I should be<br>
    happy... but I'm not. I just feel<br>
    this weight pressing down on me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Will cancelling the wedding make<br>
    you happy?</p>
  <p> She hesitates for a second... and although she tries<br>
    to say it with conviction, she's not really sure...</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Yes.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He'll probably be just as relieved<br>
    as I am.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    Data, you introduced us, you mean<br>
    a lot to both of us... I'd really<br>
    appreciate it if... you would tell<br>
    Miles for me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    If you wish.</p>
  <p> Data turns to leave... on Keiko's expression...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 OMITTED</p>
  <p>4 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data moving toward Ten Forward.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    I have often heard my friend Chief<br>
    O'Brien say that above all else,<br>
    he wants to make Keiko happy.<br>
    Since cancelling the wedding will<br>
    make her happy, I must conclude<br>
    the Chief will be pleased at her<br>
    decision.</p>
  <p> He EXITS to Ten Forward.</p>
  <p>5 INT. TEN FORWARD - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> GEORDI, O'BRIEN, and SUPERNUMERARIES. The<br>
    Supernumeraries are putting up Japanese lanterns,<br>
    decorations, etc. Geordi and O'Brien are standing<br>
    around, waiting for the rehearsal. (The lounge is<br>
    closed, no regular patrons.) Data ENTERS and goes<br>
    directly to O'Brien.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I have good news.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Oh?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Yes. Keiko has made a decision<br>
    designed to increase her<br>
    happiness.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    She has cancelled the wedding.</p>
  <p> It takes a moment for this to sink in, and O'Brien just<br>
    stares at Data for a few seconds.</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    (shocked)<br>
    She what?<br>
    (beat, then getting<br>
    angry)<br>
    Cancelled the wedding? Today?<br>
    Without even a word... of all the<br>
    childish, selfish... !</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> O'Brien EXITS. Everyone is shocked, no one more so<br>
    than Data. Geordi comes over and gives him a look of<br>
    reproach.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Next time, maybe I should break<br>
    the... good news.</p>
  <p> Geordi moves away and we PUSH IN on Data.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Commander Maddox, it would appear<br>
    that my program designed to<br>
    predict emotional responses<br>
    needs... adjustment.</p>
  <p> On Data's reaction...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>6 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; ZHUKOV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise and another starship running side by<br>
    side.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Personal Log: Supplemental. This<br>
    is the one thousand five hundred<br>
    fiftieth day since the Enterprise<br>
    was commissioned.</p>
  <p>7 INT. CORRIDOR</p>
  <p> Data moving toward Transporter Room. The Corridor<br>
    should be filled with SUPERNUMERARIES in Starfleet<br>
    uniforms, civilian clothes, sports wear... a feeling<br>
    of many cultures, activities and traditions aboard our<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Besides the arrival of Ambassador<br>
    T'Pel, other events occurring<br>
    today include four birthdays,<br>
    two personnel transfers, a<br>
    celebration of the Hindu Festival<br>
    of Lights, two chess tournaments,<br>
    one secondary school play, and<br>
    four promotions.</p>
  <p> He has arrived at Transporter Room.</p>
  <p>8 INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS. TRANSPORTER TECHNICIAN at console.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Overall... an ordinary day.</p>
  <p> TECHNICIAN<br>
    The Zhukov is ready for transport,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Energize.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> AMBASSADOR T'PEL MATERIALIZES on the platform. She is<br>
    Vulcan, middle-aged, and has the cool, regal bearing<br>
    common to her species.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Welcome aboard the Enterprise,<br>
    Ambassador.</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>
    I would meet with your Captain.</p>
  <p> Data gestures to the door and they EXIT together.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>9 INT. TURBOLIFT</p>
  <p> Data and T'Pel. Her face is impassive, unreadable...<br>
    Data's shows the innate curiosity and innocence which<br>
    is such an intrinsic part of his personality. The<br>
    Turbolift is MOVING.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Unlike my human friends, I am not<br>
    affected by feelings or emotional<br>
    considerations. In that sense,<br>
    I am closer to being Vulcan than<br>
    human, but I am not attracted to<br>
    Vulcan philosophy. Their devotion<br>
    to logic does have a certain<br>
    appeal in its simple purity...</p>
  <p> The Turbolift STOPS and they EXIT.</p>
  <p>9A INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data and T'Pel ENTER from Turbolift and walk to Ready<br>
    Room. Riker's shift is on duty (Riker not on Bridge).</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... but I find theirs to be a<br>
    somewhat... stark philosophy,<br>
    lacking beauty... and joy.</p>
  <p>10 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> PICARD and Riker standing near the desk. T'Pel and<br>
    Data ENTER.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - ACT ONE 8A.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Picard lifts his hand in the Vulcan salute.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ambassador T'Pel...</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>
    (returning salute)<br>
    I come to serve.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Your service honors us.<br>
    (gestures)<br>
    My first officer, Commander<br>
    William Riker.</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>
    (to Riker. Polite, yet<br>
    curt)<br>
    Leave us, please.</p>
  <p> Riker glances at Picard, plainly irritated at this<br>
    peremptory dismissal. Picard gives a small nod of<br>
    agreement and then Data and Riker EXIT.</p>
  <p>11 INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS</p>
  <p> Data and Riker ENTER from Ready Room.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (annoyed, to Data)<br>
    Charming woman.</p>
  <p> Riker is still irritated as he moves to Command. Data<br>
    studies him for a moment and then heads for Turbolift.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    The tone of Commander Riker's<br>
    voice makes me suspect that he<br>
    is not serious about finding<br>
    Ambassador T'Pel charming. My<br>
    experience suggests that in fact<br>
    he may mean the exact opposite<br>
    of what he says. This is a form<br>
    of expression I have not yet been<br>
    able to master.</p>
  <p> Data EXITS.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>12 INT. BARBERSHOP (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Barbershops haven't changed much and there is still a<br>
    mirror, two barberchairs, and a sink, along with 24th<br>
    century combs, scissors, shaving cubes, etc. Geordi<br>
    has just sat down in one of the chairs and an alien<br>
    barber named V'SAL comes over to look at his hair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - ACT ONE 9A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> A FEMALE ALIEN CREWMEMBER is sitting in the other chair<br>
    while a HUMAN BARBER works on her large expanse of<br>
    hair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Geordi and V'Sal are joking around. Their verbal jabs<br>
    at each other are definitely good-natured and they've<br>
    thrust and parried this way many times before.</p>
  <p> V'SAL<br>
    (looking at Geordi's<br>
    hair)<br>
    You don't need a haircut. You<br>
    were just in here last week.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (joking)<br>
    Hey, I wouldn't be back here so<br>
    soon if you'd done it right the<br>
    first time...</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS as V'Sal goes to the counter to get a<br>
    sheet and some scissors. (V'Sal's action must be long<br>
    enough for the following Data voice-over to be heard.)</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (over above action)<br>
    When I have difficulty<br>
    understanding human behavior I<br>
    often turn to Commander Geordi<br>
    La Forge. I consider him to be...<br>
    my best friend.</p>
  <p> V'Sal begins trimming Geordi's hair.</p>
  <p> V'SAL<br>
    I know you want to be beautiful...<br>
    I'm just a barber, not a miracle<br>
    worker.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just try to keep my ears on<br>
    straight today, all right?</p>
  <p> They both chuckle a little and Data realizes they're<br>
    joking.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Friendly insults and jibes...<br>
    another form of human speech<br>
    that I am attempting to master.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - ACT ONE 10A.</p>
  <p>12 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Data)<br>
    Hi... here for a trim?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My hair does not require<br>
    trimming... you peabrain.</p>
  <p> Geordi almost falls out of the chair in shock, but a<br>
    smile still forms on his face.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    My hair...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    'Peabrain'?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I am experimenting with friendly<br>
    insults and jibes. It was not<br>
    meant as a serious disparagement.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    Well... I wouldn't try it out on<br>
    the Captain.</p>
  <p> Data nods in understanding.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Geordi, I am still confused about<br>
    Chief O'Brien's reaction this<br>
    morning.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

    didn't mean to blow up like that.<br>
    He knows Keiko probably doesn't<br>
    want to call off the marriage.<br>

  <p>13 INT. REPLICATING CENTER (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The 24th century equivalent of a ship's store. There<br>
    are several computer terminals showing images of<br>
    objects ranging from clothing to furniture. Patrons<br>
    select the desired item from one of the displays, then<br>
    take an encoded padd to one of the large replicator<br>
    consoles in the b.g. TWO ADULTS are perusing one of<br>
    the displays with a CHILD.</p>
  <p>13A NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The parents are making a few final adjustments to the<br>
    image of a stuffed rabbit (or toy sailboat) on one of<br>
    the screens. The child seems happy with the choice.<br>
    They press a button, and the item MATERIALIZES on one<br>
    of the replicator stages. They take the toy.</p>
  <p>14 ON DATA (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The computer screen is showing a shovel and Data seems<br>
    unsure what to do. He taps a key and the display now<br>
    shows a chair.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>15 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Data sees WORF ENTER. Worf goes over to one of the<br>
    terminals and begins to tap in commands. Data goes<br>
    over to him.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (over above action)<br>
    I find Lieutenant Worf to be what<br>
    is called a kindred spirit. We<br>
    were both orphans and were both<br>
    rescued by Starfleet officers.<br>
    In many ways, we are both still<br>
    outsiders in Human society. I<br>
    do not fully understand why, but<br>
    I find it... comforting to think<br>
    that I am not alone in that<br>
    regard.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Are you here to find a wedding<br>
    gift?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Yes.</p>

    I would appreciate your help in<br>
    selecting an appropriate item.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (a little proudly)<br>
    Of course. I have attended human<br>
    weddings before.</p>
  <p> Worf taps in a couple commands on the display.</p>

    This is a traditional gift?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    My adoptive parents often give<br>
    these... things at family<br>
    weddings. A human custom.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/17/90 - ACT ONE 13.</p>
  <p>17 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> Worf works the display again and now the image of a<br>
    delicate glass swan is shown.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    It was my understanding that the<br>
    item selected should reflect the<br>
    personality of whoever is giving<br>
    the gift.<br>
    (looks at screen)<br>
    This does not remind me of you.</p>
  <p> Worf frowns a little... he's never thought of it quite<br>
    that way before.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Have you ever been an actual<br>
    participant in a human wedding?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (with distaste)<br>
    No.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    You would not consider it to be<br>
    an honor?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    An honor, perhaps. But human<br>
    bonding rituals involve a great<br>
    deal of talking, dancing, and<br>
    crying.</p>
  <p> Worf is still concerned with the gift and now he taps<br>
    in another command and the display screen shows a<br>
    vicious-looking Klingon weapon. Worf smiles to<br>
    himself... that's more like it! However, Data is no<br>
    longer watching him.</p>

    In many ways, she is the friend<br>

    life and her duties are predicated<br>
    on her understanding and<br>
    perception of emotions. Since<br>

  <p> TROI<br>
    Good luck.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    There are many different<br>
    opinions. On Galvin Five, a<br>
    marriage is considered successful<br>
    only if children are produced<br>
    within a year of the wedding.<br>
    Andorian marriages require groups<br>
    of four people unless two---</p>

    Data... would you like my advice<br>

    Don't. This is something they<br>
    need to work out for themselves<br>
    now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But I am their friend. Should<br>
    I not stand with them in a time<br>
    of difficulty?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There are many ways of helping<br>
    a friend... sometimes the best<br>
    way is to leave them alone.</p>

  <p> DATA<br>
    Do you believe marriage to be the<br>
    right decision for them?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't know. They are very much<br>
    in love, but sometimes that isn't<br>
    enough. Marriage is an agreement<br>
    to share who you are with someone<br>
    else... to spend your lives<br>
    together... to grow old together.</p>

    Why do you ask?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Although I am an android, I have<br>
    not excluded the possibility that<br>
    I too may someday marry.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    There's nothing wrong with that.</p>

    Indeed, I salute your show of<br>

    in her attitude.</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>
    Instruct your Transporter Room<br>

    ship without further delay.</p>
  <p> Picard is reluctant... he makes one last attempt.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Ambassador, I must once again urge<br>
    you to reconsider. The Enterprise<br>
    can accommodate a Romulan<br>
    delegation without sacrificing<br>
    security or---</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>

  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    The signal lock wasn't broken,<br>
    sir. I had just entered the<br>
    transfer sequence when the<br>
    Ambassador's pattern began to<br>
    break up. I tried to go to<br>

    Captain, there is no prior record<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I can't find any system flaws in<br>
    the unit, sir. All the<br>
    Engineering status reports were<br>
    normal. None of the backups were<br>
    activated and the autosequencers<br>
    all functioned normally.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Any prior malfunctions with this<br>
    Transporter unit?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    No, sir. In fact, we replaced<br>
    the transition coils only a week<br>
    ago.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Could there have been some kind<br>
    of interference from the Romulans?</p>
  <p> O'BRIEN<br>
    Nothing that I could see... their<br>
    shields were down... there was<br>
    no power interruption... no<br>
    subspace bias.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Geordi)<br>
    I want that unit pulled and its<br>
    systems checked again. I also<br>
    want a level one diagnostic<br>
    performed on all Transporters.</p>

    Her molecular structure<br>
    dissipated instantly once the<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    There's been... an accident.<br>
    Ambassador T'Pel... was killed<br>
    in a Transporter malfunction.</p>
  <p> Mendak is surprised... takes a second to digest this<br>

    Picard with suspicion.</p>

    We're investigating that right<br>

  <p> MENDAK<br>
    I should have known the Federation<br>
    wasn't serious about this<br>

  <p> PICARD<br>
    Admiral, I can assure you that<br>
    the Federation places the highest<br>
    priority on this mission and its<br>
    goal.</p>
  <p> Mendak isn't buying this... but his attitude shows<br>
    grudging admiration.</p>
  <p> MENDAK<br>
    Well played, Captain... well<br>
    played. Starfleet opposes<br>
    normalization of relations with<br>
    the Romulan Empire and so you are<br>
    ordered to create... an accident.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    You're mistaken. I am ready and<br>
    willing to discuss the<br>
    establishment of full diplomatic<br>
    relations under the same terms<br>
    as Ambassador T'Pel.</p>
  <p> MENDAK<br>
    (derisive laugh)<br>
    A generous offer, since you know<br>
    that we were only willing to<br>
    negotiate with T'Pel.<br>
    (shakes head)<br>
    I salute you again, Captain. It<br>
    was a maneuver worthy of a<br>
    Romulan. I suggest we both leave<br>

  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    All right... there's the genetic<br>

    beamed aboard the Enterprise.</p>
  <p> Beverly takes a small disk containing some organic<br>
    material and sets it into a slot in the machine. She<br>
    begins to work the console and now genetic information<br>
    from the material comes up on the other side of the<br>
    screen. Beverly begins to run both sets of information<br>
    through a test... the information on both sides should<br>
    be virtually identical.</p>

    The only abnormality found during<br>

    increase in the matter to energy<br>
    signal ratio. This fluctuation<br>
    was well within operating<br>
    parameters and would normally not<br>
    invite further consideration.<br>
    However, due to the circumstances,<br>
    I decided to investigate the<br>
    possibility that a second<br>
    Transporter signal had caused the<br>
    fluctuation. Although this was<br>
    highly improbable, it was the only<br>
    remaining theory.</p>

    (over above action)<br>
    In poker, there is a moment when<br>
    a player must decide if an<br>
    opponent is being deceptive or<br>
    actually holds a winning hand.<br>
    This decision is based not only<br>
    on the odds, but also on an<br>
    appraisal of the man. Is he<br>
    bluffing or does he have the<br>
    cards?</p>
  <p> Mendak finally sees that Picard means business.</p>
  <p> MENDAK<br>
    Fortunately... I'm not ready to<br>
    start a war today...</p>
  <p> Mendak gestures to someone o.s. and Ambassador T'Pel<br>
    moves into view, wearing a ROMULAN UNIFORM. There are<br>
    shocked reactions around the Bridge.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    T'Pel?</p>
  <p> T'PEL<br>
    Sub-Commander Selok, actually.</p>
  <p> It's all clear to Picard now.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    A spy.</p>
  <p> MENDAK<br>
    A patriot, Captain... she has<br>
    performed her service to the<br>
    Empire with distinction.</p>
  <p> T'PEL/SELOK<br>
    (smiles)<br>
    Thank you for your... help,<br>
    Captain.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - ACT FIVE 55.</p>
  <p>60 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> MENDAK<br>
    You can see now that we are not<br>
    holding one of your citizens...<br>
    and we thank you for returning<br>
    our sister to us.<br>
    (voice hardens)<br>
    But my patience has limits... the<br>
    game is over. I expect you to<br>
    leave peacefully. Now.</p>
  <p> The transmission ENDS.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, long-range scanners show<br>
    three more Romulan ships moving<br>
    into this sector.</p>
  <p> Picard takes that in... looks at Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (quiet)<br>
    Some days you get the bear, some<br>
    days the bear gets you.</p>
  <p> Picard sees the only rational course of action.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Reverse course... take us back<br>
    to Federation territory, warp six.<br>
    Engage.</p>
  <p>61 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE &amp; ROMULANS (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise turns and moves away.</p>
  <p>62 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> As before... PUSH IN on Data.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    Captain Picard once drew an<br>
    analogy between life and a chess<br>
    game... he said that the loss of<br>
    a single piece does not concede<br>
    the game itself.</p>
  <p> Data glances over his shoulder at the others on the<br>
    Bridge. People are returning to normal business. The<br>
    Red Alert indicators turn OFF.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT FIVE 56.</p>
  <p>62 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    The Captain has also said that<br>
    out of the ashes of defeat rise<br>
    the victorious dreams of men.<br>
    I find that to be a worthy<br>
    philosophy and I have incorporated<br>
    it into my programming.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>63 INT. ARBORETUM</p>
  <p> Keiko is scanning a tree with a tricorder. In contrast<br>
    to her earlier attitude, she is bright and cheerful.<br>
    Data ENTERS.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Keiko, I need your help.<br>
    (off her surprised look)<br>
    I have offended you and need to<br>
    find a way to rectify my mistake.<br>
    I am not sure what to do.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    You didn't offend me.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    I should not have interfered.<br>
    It would be best if I apologized.</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    It would be best if you got<br>
    dressed.<br>
    (off his reaction)<br>
    For the wedding?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    But...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT FIVE 57.</p>
  <p>63 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> KEIKO<br>
    Oh, come here... I have a<br>
    beautiful carnation for the<br>
    father of the bride... don't be<br>
    nervous now...</p>
  <p> As she goes off to get it...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Keiko, as she<br>
    leaves)<br>
    I am not nervous.<br>
    (beat, to himself)<br>
    I am just... confused.</p>

  <p>64 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship stopped in space.</p>
  <p>65 INT. TEN FORWARD - ON DATA</p>
  <p> He is looking at something o.s.... Japanese wedding<br>
    MUSIC (called gagaku) is playing in the b.g. After<br>
    a few seconds, MOVE TO reveal Data (dress uniform, with<br>
    a boutonniere) standing in Ten Forward, which is<br>
    decorated for the wedding. This is a celebration of<br>
    two cultures (Japanese &amp; Irish) and there should<br>
    fixtures from both.</p>
  <p>66 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> Picard is standing in front of the center window with<br>
    O'Brien before him and Geordi standing in place as best<br>
    man. (All three in dress uniforms) A white,<br>
    earthenware goblet sits on a table next to O'Brien.<br>
    Riker and Troi (in standard uniforms) are standing to<br>
    one side and there are SUPERNUMERARIES gathered around.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>67 ON KEIKO</p>
  <p> She is kneeling in prayer off to one side of the room.<br>
    She is wearing a semi-traditional Japanese wedding<br>
    kimono of black silk, with a few modern touches.</p>
  <p> Data waits just behind her. Keiko finishes her silent<br>
    prayer to her ancestors and stands. Data takes her<br>
    arm and they walk toward O'Brien.</p>
  <p>68 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> as Data and Keiko move to O'Brien. Data hands the<br>
    bride to him and then he takes the goblet from the<br>
    table and hands it to Keiko. She drinks from it in<br>
    three quick sips and then hands it to O'Brien. He also<br>
    drinks in three sips. Data takes the goblet and sets<br>
    it back on the table. Everyone now looks to Picard</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Since the time of the first wooden<br>
    sailing ships, all captains have<br>
    enjoyed the happy privilege of<br>
    joining two people in the bonds<br>
    of matrimony. And so now it is<br>
    my honor to unite you Keiko<br>
    Ishikawa, and you Miles Edward<br>
    O'Brien together in marriage here<br>
    in the sight of your friends and<br>
    family.</p>
  <p> MOVE TO Data as he watches the ceremony.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (over part of the above)<br>
    There are still many human<br>
    emotions I do not fully<br>
    comprehend... anger, hatred,<br>
    revenge...</p>
  <p>69 ON O'BRIEN &amp; KEIKO</p>
  <p> as O'Brien kisses Keiko... and everyone CHEERS. The<br>
    Japanese music is replaced by a bright, lively, IRISH<br>
    TUNE and people gather round to congratulate the happy<br>
    couple.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    But I am not mystified by the<br>
    desire to be loved...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/15/90 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>70 ON DATA &amp; KEIKO</p>
  <p> a short time later as Data dances gracefully with the<br>
    new bride.</p>
  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    ... the need for friendship...<br>
    these are things I do understand.</p>
  <p> As they dance...</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>71 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The ship moving at warp speed.</p>
  <p>72 INT. NURSERY</p>
  <p> Data ENTERS (now in standard uniform). The room is<br>
    quiet and dark. Picard (still in dress uniform) and<br>
    the Nurse are near a small cradle... the Nurse gesture<br>
    to the cradle and then walks away from Picard as if she<br>
    had just showed him the way over there. Picard looks<br>
    down for a beat and then notices Data.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (quietly)<br>
    I was looking for Doctor Crusher.<br>
    I wished to thank her for my...</p>
  <p> He trails off, not wanting to give away her secret.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    She just left.</p>
  <p> He looks back into the cradle and Data moves over for<br>
    a better view.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The Juarez child?</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (nods)<br>
    A boy.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    At the same time we were facing<br>
    destruction... this small miracle<br>
    was taking place.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Data's Day&quot; - REV. 10/18/90 - ACT FIVE 61.</p>
  <p>73 NEW ANGLE</p>
  <p> now including the JUAREZ BABY sleeping in the cradle.<br>
    Picard leans forward.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (softly)<br>
    Welcome aboard.</p>
  <p> CUT TO:</p>
  <p>74 INT. MAIN BRIDGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Worf in Command and SUPERNUMERARIES (different from<br>
    Riker's shift) at the other stations. Data and his<br>
    shift ENTER from Turbolifts. This is night again, so<br>
    the Bridge lighting is DARK.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (stands)<br>
    All systems normal, sir. We are<br>
    on course for Adelphous Four.<br>
    Engineering is realigning the main<br>
    deflector dish, Sickbay reports<br>
    Lieutenant Umbato broke two ribs<br>
    during a Holodeck exercise, and<br>
    sensors continue to gather long<br>
    range information on the Murasaki<br>
    Quasar.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Very well. I have the Bridge.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Begin night watch.</p>
  <p> The LIGHTS DARKEN to signal the end of the 'day'.<br>
    Data's people smoothly take their positions and Worf<br>
    EXITS along with his shift. Data sits in Command and<br>
    contemplates the stars on the main viewer.</p>

  <p> DATA (V.O.)<br>
    If being human is not simply a<br>
    matter of being born flesh and<br>
    blood... if it is instead a way<br>
    of thinking, acting... and<br>
    feeling... then I am hopeful that<br>
    one day I will discover my own<br>
    humanity. Until then Commander<br>
    Maddox, I will continue...<br>
    learning, changing, growing...<br>
