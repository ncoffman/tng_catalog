    TEASER </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 EXT. TARCHANNEN - RECORDING DEVICE POV (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A VISUAL OVERLAY, complete with ticking stardate, is<br>
    superimposed over a dark, desolate landscape of spindly<br>
    black plants and shadowy dunes... a world of perpetual<br>
    twilight.</p>
  <p> BREVELLE (O.S.)<br>
    Tarchannen Three Investigation.<br>
    Stardate 40164.7. Ensign Anthony<br>
    Brevelle Recording. Lieutenant<br>
    Susanna Leijten in command.</p>
  <p> Then the recording device pans to include a small,<br>
    futuristic structure... and LIEUTENANT SUSANNA LEIJTEN.<br>
    Late twenties, striking, dynamic. She faces the<br>
    camera.</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    You up and running, Brevelle?</p>
  <p> BREVELLE (O.S.)<br>
    Yes, Lieutenant.</p>
  <p> GEORDI moves into view, holding a Tricorder. (Note:<br>
    Geordi is younger here, wearing a slightly different,<br>
    earlier version of his VISOR.)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (baffled)<br>
    I've checked buildings Four and<br>
    Five... they're like all the<br>
    others... no phaser hits, no sign<br>
    of a fight. Looks like the entire<br>
    outpost just... vanished...</p>
  <p> HICKMAN (O.S.)<br>
    (from a distance)<br>
    Lieutenant Leijten...</p>
  <p> The recording device pans back out into that gloomy<br>
    landscape to reveal two palm beacons in the distance.<br>
    One is held by ENSIGN PAUL HICKMAN, the other by ENSIGN<br>
    EMILITA MENDEZ.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/15/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> HICKMAN<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You'd better come see this...</p>
  <p>2 FOLLOW SUSANNA AND GEORDI (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> As they hurry toward Hickman and Mendez.</p>
  <p> HICKMAN<br>
    No footprints... no vehicle<br>
    tracks. The wind probably erased<br>
    them... but look...</p>
  <p> Then as Hickman lifts a dirty, torn Starfleet uniform<br>
    into view, a disembodied voice is heard...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA (O.S.)<br>
    Freeze visual.</p>
  <p> Everything and everyone FREEZES as we REVEAL...</p>
  <p>3 INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> This has all taken place on the wall MONITOR. A<br>
    slightly older Susanna stands beside it, pointing to<br>
    their images as she speaks...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    That's Hickman on the right...<br>
    that's Mendez on the left...<br>
    and as already noted, the<br>
    recording was made by Ensign<br>
    Brevelle... five years ago...</p>
  <p> As she turns to face PICARD, RIKER, and GEORDI...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Commander Leijten, you said<br>
    Brevelle was ill last week for<br>
    several days before he...<br>
    deserted. What about Mendez?</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    Mendez was last seen aboard the<br>
    Aries an hour before she<br>
    disappeared. According to<br>
    witnesses, she seemed completely<br>
    normal.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And Hickman?</p>
  <p> Susanna shakes her head.</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    He just passed a routine<br>
    physical... with flying colors.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (skeptical)<br>
    I know Paul Hickman. He's a<br>
    family man... two kids. I can't<br>
    believe he'd steal a shuttle and<br>
    desert...</p>
  <p> Susanna sits down in the chair beside him.</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    Believe it, Geordi. He was<br>
    spotted by a Federation supply<br>
    ship yesterday... on a course<br>
    toward Tarchannen Three.</p>
  <p> Everyone ponders this for a moment. Then...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    The original Tarchannen<br>
    disapperances were never solved,<br>
    were they?</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    No... we never learned what<br>
    happened or why. Forty-nine<br>
    people... gone...</p>
  <p> Riker contemplates the monitor...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    And now, five years later, members<br>
    of the away team that investigated<br>
    the disappearances... have started<br>
    disappearing themselves.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Geordi and I are the only two<br>
    left.</p>
  <p> And off this ominous statement...</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF TEASER </p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE 5.</p>
  <p> ACT ONE </p>
  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At warp speed.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O)<br>
    Captain's log, Stardate 44664.5.<br>
    We have set a course to intercept<br>
    Lieutenant Hickman's stolen<br>
    shuttlecraft... and, hopefully,<br>
    to discover the whereabouts of<br>
    the other missing officers...</p>
  <p>5 INT. TEN FORWARD (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Geordi and Susanna at a table, drinking drinks.<br>
    There's a subtext here... both have to wonder if<br>
    they're in some kind of danger... but they try to mask<br>
    it with casual humor and small talk...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    And then I almost married Paul<br>
    Bogrow...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Bogrow... which one was he?</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    You remember... with the thin<br>
    moustache...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (remembering)<br>
    Not Bogrow...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The one who used to drive you<br>
    crazy... you thought he was so<br>
    full of himself...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    Well, I decided I prejudged him<br>
    unfairly...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE 6.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Uh huh...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    And then I decided I'd been right<br>
    in the first place.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (laughs, shakes his<br>
    head)<br>
    Bogrow...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    And what about you... how come<br>
    you never found the right girl?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I enjoy the bachelor's life too<br>
    much...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    That doesn't sound like my &quot;little<br>
    brother&quot; who always wanted advice<br>
    on women...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Well, you were obviously a great<br>
    advisor...</p>
  <p> Susanna nods. Suddenly somber.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    What do you think, Suz?</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    I don't know. But I'm not ashamed<br>
    to tell you...<br>
    (beat)<br>
    I'm a little scared, you know?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE 6A.</p>
  <p>5 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, I know.</p>
  <p> A beat as Susanna tries to lift their spirits out of<br>
    the dip...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    Well, if anybody's gonna figure<br>
    this out, it'll be the Leitjen<br>
    and La Forge Show, right? We<br>
    always made a good team...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A helluva team...</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Commander La Forge, Commander<br>
    Leijten, report to the Bridge.<br>
    We have a fix on the missing<br>
    shuttle.</p>
  <p> Geordi and Susanna exchange a look as...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (keying insignia)<br>
    On our way, Commander.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/15/91 - ACT ONE 7.</p>
  <p>6 OMITTED</p>
  <p>7 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, WORF, DATA at their positions; ENSIGN<br>
    GRAHAM at the helm; SUPERNUMERARIES as needed.</p>
  <p> GRAHAM<br>
    Entering the Tarchannen system,<br>
    sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Slow to impulse power. Mister<br>
    Worf?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Long range sensors holding on the<br>
    shuttlecraft... bearing zero one<br>
    zero, mark two seven one.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Hail the vessel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Lieutenant Hickman is not<br>
    responding, sir.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Put a repeating message on all<br>
    sub-space channels. Make it a<br>
    Priority One communique -- order<br>
    the Lieutenant to come about and<br>
    stand to.</p>
  <p> As Geordi and Susanna ENTER from the turbolift...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Still no response, sir.</p>
  <p> GRAHAM<br>
    The craft is now within visual<br>
    range.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    On screen.</p>
  <p>8 ANGLE ON VIEW SCREEN (OPTICAL) (INTERCUT)</p>
  <p> A Federation shuttle speeding through space. Susanna<br>
    watches the view screen, takes a nervous breath.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/15/91 - ACT ONE 7A.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> This is it -- the investigation is at a critical<br>
    moment...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The shuttle's acceleration is<br>
    increasing... its trajectory is<br>
    moving directly into the<br>
    planet's atmosphere.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE 8.</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> Approaching TARCHANNEN THREE, a grey orb visible in<br>
    the distance.</p>
  <p>10 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Riker's on his feet. Geordi stands by Data at Ops.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    He will reach an atmospheric<br>
    interface at an altitude of two<br>
    hundred and ten kilometers.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    At his current speed, he'll<br>
    self-destruct.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    That is correct, Commander.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    How soon, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (checking panels)<br>
    Fifty-three seconds.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Options?</p>
  <p> GRAHAM<br>
    He's out of transporter range.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    And he's too far away for a<br>
    positive lock with the tractor<br>
    beam.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (quickly, to Worf)<br>
    Open a channel.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Open.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Lieutenant Hickman, listen<br>
    carefully. I am Captain Picard<br>
    of the Enterprise. You are in<br>
    danger. You must slow your rate<br>
    of approach.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/15/91 - ACT ONE 9.</p>
  <p>10 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (reacting to console)<br>
    The shuttle is approaching the<br>
    outer thermosphere, Captain.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    He's panicking...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    At current rate of acceleration,<br>
    the shuttlecraft will be destroyed<br>
    in twenty-eight seconds.</p>
  <p>11 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttlecraft continues on toward Tarchannen at<br>
    faster speed.</p>
  <p>12 INT. MAIN BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Data responds to his console...</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    Sixteen seconds to impact.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to com)<br>
    Lieutenant Hickman, you must do<br>
    as I tell you. Reduce your<br>
    velocity and bring your craft to<br>
    a positive pitch of twenty<br>
    degrees... now.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The shuttle is entering the lower<br>
    ionosphere...</p>
  <p>13 EXT. SPACE - THE SHUTTLE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> It flies toward the planet and burns into the<br>
    atmosphere. A spectacular FLASH, some stray sparks...<br>
    then nothing.</p>
  <p>14 INT. BRIDGE - CLOSE UPS - VARIOUS</p>
  <p> Riker, Worf, Picard, Geordi, and finally Susanna...<br>
    shocked. Then...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/15/91 - ACT ONE 10.</p>
  <p>14 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Sir, sensors detect two more<br>
    Federation shuttlecraft on the<br>
    planet's surface... no life signs.</p>
  <p> Reactions...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Ready an away team, Number One.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Geordi, Data, Worf...</p>
  <p> Riker looks at Susanna, nods.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    And Commander Leijten.</p>
  <p> Then as they all head for the turbolift...</p>
  <p>15 EXT. TARCHANNEN OUTPOST - ESTABLISHING</p>
  <p> After five years, sand dunes have begun to encroach<br>
    upon the abandoned facility.</p>
  <p>16 EXT. TARCHANNEN SURFACE - NEARBY (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> A dark and gloomy landscape... trapped in a perpetual<br>
    twilight. Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and Susanna<br>
    MATERIALIZE in a clearing near a SHUTTLECRAFT. They<br>
    flick on their palm beacons and move toward it, Susanna<br>
    in the lead.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Commander Leijten, La Forge, check<br>
    the shuttle... Worf, Data, you've<br>
    got the perimeter.</p>
  <p>17 SUSANNA</p>
  <p> Checks the side of the shuttle for identification...<br>
    finds it.</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    It's the shuttle pod Mendez stole<br>
    from the Aries...</p>
  <p> Geordi pulls the shuttle's doors open and ENTERS it.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - 1/11/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>18 INT. SHUTTLECRAFT</p>
  <p> Geordi looks around the cramped interior, then<br>
    glances down... and picks up a Starfleet uniform...<br>
    torn to shreds.</p>
  <p>19 EXT. TARCHANNEN SURFACE</p>
  <p> Susanna inspects the ground in front of the shuttle,<br>
    sees something, shines her light on it and discovers...</p>
  <p>20 FOOTPRINTS</p>
  <p> Scattered in the dirt... footprints which are clearly<br>
    not human...</p>
  <p> Susanna's expression turns blank, as if something<br>
    inside her has clicked on. She follows the prints out<br>
    into the darkness.</p>
  <p>21 ON WORF</p>
  <p> Close by, examining the ground with his beacon. He<br>
    looks up, suddenly wary. His eyes shift with a<br>
    warrior's alertness as he slowly shines his light out<br>
    into the darkness.</p>
  <p>22 ON RIKER AND DATA</p>
  <p> Data is scanning the area with his Tricorder.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No life signs, sir.</p>
  <p> Worf approaches them, looking uncomfortable...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (low)<br>
    Sir... I am certain that we are<br>
    being watched.</p>
  <p> Reactions. Riker sweeps his beacon through the<br>
    darkness. Data performs a quick scan with his<br>
    Tricorder. Nothing. They exchange a look -- this is<br>
    nothing short of creepy...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; - REV. 1/14/91 - ACT ONE 12.</p>
  <p>23 ANGLE - THE SHUTTLE DOORS</p>
  <p> Geordi EXITS the shuttle to meet with the others. He<br>
    shows them the torn uniform.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Commander Riker...</p>
  <p> A beat as they all react. Then...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Where's Commander Leijten?</p>
  <p> They look about. No sign of her.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (keys insignia)<br>
    Susanna, report.</p>
  <p> Nothing. Riker exchanges a grim look with the others.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Fan out. Let's find her.</p>
  <p> They move off in different directions.</p>
  <p>24 ANGLE - IN FRONT OF SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Geordi stops and looks around...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (calls out)<br>
    Susanna?</p>
  <p> No response. He spots Susanna's footprints in the dirt<br>
    and follows them...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (keys communicator)<br>

    Do I look as bad as I feel?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You look fine... now.</p>

  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    What happened?</p>

    Your blood chemistry is way off.<br>
    And you had a histamine response,<br>

    I'll run a complete blood and<br>

    Your devotion to duty is<br>
    admirable, Commander... but Doctor<br>

    They've lost one Starfleet officer today... and they<br>

  <p> Geordi and Susanna walk along. She is clearly<br>
    agitated, talking a little too fast...</p>
  <p> SUSANNA<br>
    Captain Picard's wrong. The way<br>
    to handle this is to get back down<br>
    there with a dozen away teams...<br>
    fan out from the shuttle... We<br>
    can cover a lot of ground in a<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How long?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    I don't know what we're dealing<br>
    with. Brevelle was sick for days<br>

  <p> Picard thinks about this. Knowing exactly what he<br>

    this problem with what humans<br>
    commonly refer to as a fresh point<br>
    of view...</p>
  <p> This is as close to human concern as Data can<br>
    express... and Geordi knows it. He manages a smile.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    You're probably right, Data. But<br>
