  <p> FADE IN:</p>
  <p>1 INT. 17TH CENTURY FRANCE - DINING ROOM</p>
  <p> A very spare, period dining room -- simple wooden table<br>
    and two chairs, more functional than fancy. BEVERLY<br>
    CRUSHER wears a beautiful dress; REGINALD BARCLAY, has<br>
    the clothes of a duellist -- and a LARGE NOSE. They<br>
    are doing CYRANO DE BERGERAC.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    -- You were like a brother to<br>
    me. We played in the park near<br>
    the lake.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Of course -- Every summer you<br>
    came to Bergerac!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    You used to make swords out of<br>
    the reeds -- And when you cut<br>
    your hand, you would run to<br>
    me, and I would say --<br>
    (taking his hand)<br>
    &quot;Let me see --&quot;</p>
  <p> She sees real blood on the hand from a cut, and reacts.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh! How did you do that?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    &quot;Playing&quot; near the Porte de<br>
    Nesle.</p>
  <p> She wets a handkerchief and starts to wash his hand.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And how many were against you?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No more than a hundred.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Tell me!</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/30/91 - TEASER 2.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No... Let it go. You tell me<br>
    what you were going to say. Do<br>
    you dare?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (still holding his hand)<br>
    I do dare... I love someone.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Ah!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    But he does not know.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Ah!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not yet. He is proud, noble,<br>
    brave and beautiful --</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (turns pale, quickly<br>
    rises)<br>
    Beautiful!</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    What's the matter?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (smiling to cover it)<br>
    With me? Nothing. Just my hand.<br>
    (beat)<br>
    He is in the Guards?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Since this morning. Baron<br>
    Christien de Neuvillette. In your<br>
    own regiment.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Ah...</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Promise to be his friend.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I promise.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    And never let him fight a duel.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/30/91 - TEASER 2A.</p>
  <p>1 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    God forbid.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Oh, I love you.<br>
    (standing)<br>
    I must go now. You never told<br>
    me what happened last night.<br>
    And tell him to write me. A<br>
    hundred men against one. To<br>
    write, remember. A hundred men!<br>
    What courage!</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (aside to audience)<br>
    Oh... I have done better since...</p>
  <p> Barclay holds the moment in character. He is met with<br>
    applause.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/29/91 - TEASER 3.</p>
  <p>2 INCLUDE AUDIENCE</p>
  <p> RIKER, DATA, GEORDI, TROI, WORF, and a few<br>
    supernumeraries still clapping.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Bravo.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Wonderful.</p>
  <p> Data reacts with puzzlement to the applause. He<br>
    himself has not joined in.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (to Riker)<br>
    Lieutenant Barclay's performance<br>
    was superficially adequate but<br>
    clearly not rooted in The Method<br>
    approach. As a result, his<br>
    customary anxiety was evident.<br>
    I do not understand why...</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    (still clapping)<br>
    -- Because it's polite, Data.</p>
  <p> Data considers for a beat, and joins in the applause<br>
    as it finishes. Beverly and Barclay step off the<br>
    &quot;stage&quot; area to meet their friends, who stand to greet<br>
    them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (re: Barclay)<br>
    Not a bad showing after only six<br>
    weeks of lessons.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not a bad showing period.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (sheepish, re: Beverly)<br>
    I... we have a very... patient<br>
    teacher.</p>
  <p> Beverly eyes Worf.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    There's an opening in my<br>
    workshop... Worf.</p>
  <p> Worf grunts his disapproval of the suggestion, and the<br>
    others laugh as the group begins to break up.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - TEASER 4.</p>
  <p>3 ON TROI AND BARCLAY</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Well done.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Thank... thank you...<br>
    Counselor...</p>
  <p> Barclay is more confident than we saw him in his debut<br>
    episode, but still a far cry from Enterprise norm (he<br>
    still has trouble meeting another's gaze). And he's<br>
    noticeably even less sure of himself than he appeared<br>
    in the acting scene only moments ago.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    You've come a long way, Reg.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    After... more rehearsals than I<br>
    can count.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I don't just mean your acting<br>
    ability. It takes a great deal<br>
    of courage to put yourself on<br>
    display like that.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You think so...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (acknowledges)<br>
    There was a time when nothing<br>
    could have dragged you onto a<br>
    stage in front of an audience.<br>
    You've made tremendous progress.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I... I guess...</p>
  <p> He's hesitant. She picks up on it, encourages him.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Don't you think so?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Well...</p>
  <p> She waits him out for a beat. He indicates his<br>
    costume.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - TEASER 5.</p>
  <p>3 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    I still feel more... more<br>
    comfortable playing somebody else.<br>
    Maybe all this is no better than<br>
    escaping into a holodeck fantasy.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I disagree. This isn't fantasy<br>
    -- it's theatre. You used to<br>
    withdraw into the holodeck. You<br>
    isolated yourself inside your own<br>
    imagination, avoiding contact with<br>
    real people.</p>
  <p> She indicates the stage.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Look at yourself now... and look<br>
    at all the other people you're<br>
    with... you're not just acting,<br>
    you're inter-acting. Give<br>
    yourself some credit, Mister<br>
    Barclay!</p>
  <p> He nods.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Maybe... you're right.</p>
  <p> Troi smiles and goes out the door. Stay on Barclay,<br>
    alone in costume, audience gone. Despite some<br>
    progress, we get a sense of just how painful it still<br>
    is to be Barclay.</p>
  <p>4 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The Enterprise hovering in front of the ARGUS ARRAY.<br>
    It is a huge subspace radio telescope -- a series of<br>
    panels, resembling several very long box-kites stacked<br>
    one on top of the other. It looks absolutely immense.</p>
  <p> PICARD (V.O.)<br>
    Captain's log, stardate 44704.2.<br>
    We have arrived at the Argus<br>
    Array, the remote subspace<br>
    telescope at the very edge of<br>
    Federation space.<br>
    (MORE)</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - TEASER 6.</p>
  <p>4 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD (Cont'd)<br>
    The unmanned structure<br>
    mysteriously stopped relaying its<br>
    data nearly two months ago.</p>
  <p>5 INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> PICARD, Riker, Worf, Data, Geordi and ENSIGN APRIL<br>
    ANAYA.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    The fusion reactors that power<br>
    the array are extremely unstable.<br>
    The risk of overload is high.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    What about the computer systems?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    (testing panels)<br>
    They do not seem to be functioning<br>
    at all.</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    Captain! I am picking up an<br>
    unidentified device! One point<br>
    eight kilometers from the array!</p>

  <p>8 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN -- THE PROBE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> We see a panel of the Array, and hanging in front of<br>
    it, a silent, probe-like device.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Magnify.</p>
  <p> The image on the viewscreen is replaced by a highly<br>
    MAGNIFIED VIEW of the probe.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Some kind of probe. I'll bet<br>
    that's what damaged the array.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/28/91 - TEASER 7.</p>
  <p>8 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (to Worf)<br>
    Is it emitting any signals,<br>
    Lieutenant?</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Negative, sir. I show no<br>
    activity.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Mister La Forge, why don't you<br>
    go out and take a closer look.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (exiting)<br>
    Aye, sir.<br>
    (to Com)<br>
    Mister Barclay, report to<br>
    Main Shuttlebay.</p>
  <p> As the turbolift closes behind Geordi, OFF Picard as<br>
    he stares at the viewscreen...</p>
  <p>9 EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> The shuttle is already in space... moving away from the<br>
    ship.</p>
  <p>10 INT. SHUTTLE</p>
  <p> Geordi at the helm, Barclay at his station.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Enterprise, this is Shuttle Five,<br>
    in position. Ready to begin<br>
    short-range scan.</p>
  <p> RIKER'S COM VOICE<br>
    Proceed, Shuttle Five.</p>
  <p>11 INCLUDE SHUTTLE WINDOW (OPTICAL)</p>
  <p> At this close distance, the Array can be seen only as a<br>
    grey, metallic backdrop. Hanging motionless in front<br>
    of it, only meters from the shuttle, is the alien<br>
    probe, vaguely cylindrical, about ten meters tall and<br>
    three wide.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - TEASER 8.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    Let's start with the passive high<br>
    res series.</p>
  <p> Barclay is a little nervous, but it's combined with an<br>
    excitement about being there.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Electromagnetic band?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Give it a try.</p>
  <p> Barclay nods and touches his instrument panel.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I'm picking up visual wavelengths<br>
    only. Between forty-five...<br>
    forty-five hundred and seven<br>
    thousand angstroms.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Try the neutron densitometer.</p>
  <p> Barclay touches the panel.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Nothing.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hmmmm. Doesn't seem to want to<br>
    give up any secrets. Let's go<br>
    to active scan.</p>
  <p> Barclay keys it in. They're both surprised at the<br>
    instruments.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    No... No modulation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (to probe)<br>
    You are definitely not from our<br>
    neighborhood.<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    Increase to three point zero.</p>
  <p> Barclay does so. Glances over at Geordi.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - TEASER 9.</p>
  <p>11 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (hesitantly)<br>
    Commander?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Yeah, Reg?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Thanks for... for assigning me<br>
    to this mission.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Don't mention it. You're one of<br>
    my top engineers. It's about time<br>
    you started to do the interesting<br>
    stuff.<br>
    (re: situation)<br>
    This is why I'm in Starfleet.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (off instruments)<br>
    Still no modulation.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Hit it with the positron emission.</p>
  <p> Barclay touches his panel -- the probe responds with a<br>
    BLINDING FLASH of white light that lights up the entire<br>
    inside of the shuttle for an instant before shutting<br>
    down again.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    What was that?<br>
    (looking at instruments)<br>
    Our computer is down!</p>
  <p> He glances over -- Barclay is slumped back in his<br>
    chair, unconscious. Geordi is alarmed. He shakes<br>
    Barclay.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Reg! Reg!</p>
  <p> Geordi puts a finger on Barclay's neck to feel for a<br>
    pulse. OFF the concern on his face.</p>

    Captain's log, supplemental. An<br>
    intense energy surge from the<br>
    alien probe has severly disabled<br>
    the shuttle's onboard computer.<br>
    The away team has been transported<br>
    directly to Sickbay.</p>
  <p>12A INT. BRIDGE</p>
  <p> Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, Ensign Anaya.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Any indication of the probe's<br>
    energy source, Data?</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    No sir. Power emissions do not<br>
    match any known radiation<br>
    patterns. We have not encountered<br>
    this technology before.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Very well. Isolate the probe and<br>
    place it in tow. We'll take it<br>
    to Science Station Four-Oh-Two<br>
    in the Kohlan system...</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    (interrupting)<br>
    Captain. The probe has begun to<br>
    move. It is approaching the<br>
    Enterprise.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    Shields up!</p>
  <p> WORF<br>
    Aye, sir.</p>
  <p> OFF Picard's reaction...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - 1/25/91 - ACT ONE 11.</p>
  <p>13 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Barclay is sitting up on a diagnostic bed, looking<br>
    completely normal. Beverly and Geordi are standing<br>
    next to him. Crusher turns to Barclay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    There was enough energy in that<br>
    flash to overload your optic<br>
    nerves. It knocked you<br>
    unconscious.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    My VISOR must have filtered it<br>
    out.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Exactly.<br>
    (to Barclay)<br>
    Well, there's no apparent retinal<br>
    damage and the cornea looks fine.<br>
    But I'm still waiting for the full<br>
    sero-amino readout. I'll call<br>
    you when it comes in.</p>
  <p> Barclay takes this as a dismissal, and gets down off<br>
    the bed, joining Geordi. Beverly heads for another<br>
    part of Sickbay. Barclay thinks for a moment, then<br>
    hesitantly calls after her.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You shouldn't have to... wait so<br>

    Your report, Mister La Forge.</p>
  <p> Geordi steps over to a schematic representation of the<br>
    Array on the monitor.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Each of the telescope's subspace<br>
    antenna clusters is powered by<br>
    its own fusion reactor. But a<br>
    single computer controls them all.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    So, all eighteen reactors were<br>
    affected when the computer was<br>
    damaged... ?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nods)<br>
    They're starting to overload, and<br>
    could eventually go critical.<br>
    If that happens, the explosion<br>
    would destroy the Array. And I<br>
    wouldn't want to be next door if<br>
    that happens.</p>
  <p> DATA<br>
    A standard isolation procedure<br>
    would be advisable.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    I agree. We'll cut off each<br>
    reactor from the damaged control<br>
    system and repair them one by one.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>

    I would not have you weep any<br>
    less for that charming, good,<br>
    handsome Christien. I only ask<br>
    this: that as the great cold<br>

  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Is that a professional opinion?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Pure observation.</p>
  <p> Barclay studies her for a moment.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    It's true. I can't explain it.<br>
    But in the last few days I've<br>
    found a confidence that I never<br>
    knew was there.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I'm proud of you, Reg... and I'm<br>
    glad for you, too.</p>
  <p> He gives her a meaningful look -- not like a lounge<br>
    lizard, but like someone who has always had a crush and<br>
    is finally confident enough to act on it. Noting the<br>
    sexual tension, she decides it's time to leave.</p>

  <p> Geordi scowls. Turns and quickly heads for the exit.<br>
    OFF the look between Brower and Larson.</p>
  <p>41 INT. HOLODECK - CLOSE ON</p>
  <p> a man who appears to be ALBERT EINSTEIN, writing a long<br>
    equation on a blackboard in the undressed holodeck.<br>
    The board is already covered with mathematical symbols.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    G sub I J of t as t approaches<br>
    infinity...</p>
  <p> A hand reaches in and rubs out the appropriate symbol.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY (O.S.)<br>
    That's G of t over G-naught.</p>
  <p>42 INCLUDE BARCLAY</p>
  <p> standing next to Einstein, chalk in hand. He makes<br>
    the correction on the board as the great physicist<br>
    watches.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    So it is, so it is.</p>
  <p> Barclay points to a different part of the formula.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I still don't see how you can<br>
    incorporate the quantum principle<br>
    into general relativity without<br>
    adjusting the cosmological<br>
    constant a lot more than you're<br>
    doing here.</p>

  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    If we increase the value as you<br>
    suggest, we must face the<br>
    possibility of twenty-six<br>
    dimensions, instead of ten!</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (laughs)<br>
    I'm not sure if I'm ready for<br>
    that.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    (good humored)<br>
    I certainly am not.</p>
  <p> Barclay thinks a moment. Points to the board.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    But if this semiset was curved<br>
    into the subatomic, the infinities<br>
    might cancel each other out.</p>
  <p> Einstein gives Barclay an amazed look.</p>
  <p> EINSTEIN<br>
    Gruss Gott. They just might.</p>
  <p> As Einstein feverishly continues writing on the board,<br>
    the two hear someone CLEARING HIS THROAT. As they turn<br>
    towards the sound --</p>
  <p>43 INCLUDE GEORDI</p>
  <p> standing in the doorway, staring at the board --<br>
    clearly unable to decipher it.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>

  <p> Einstein DISAPPEARS in mid-chalk stroke. Barclay<br>
    quickly joins Geordi and they walk together out of the<br>

  <p> Geordi and Barclay walking away from the holodeck.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I had some ideas late last<br>
    night... I needed to consult the<br>
    computer about some quantum<br>
    electrodynamic calculations. A<br>
    holodeck Einstein program seemed<br>
    like the best way. I guess I went<br>
    a little overboard.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    A little? Most of the stuff on<br>
    that blackboard was way out of<br>
    my league. Yours too.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Not really. I just never thought<br>
    along those lines before. It's<br>
    all pretty evident now... I'm sure<br>
    if you put your mind to it --</p>
  <p> Geordi stops, interrupting him.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    -- Ever since our run-in with the<br>
    probe, something's been different<br>
    about you.</p>
  <p> A long beat as Barclay looks at Geordi.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Because I'm starting to behave<br>
    a little more like the rest of<br>
    the crew? With confidence in what<br>
    I'm doing?</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    You just spent the entire night<br>

    Yes, but --</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    -- Something's happened to you,<br>
    Reg. We can't ignore that.</p>
  <p> Barclay pauses, looks at Geordi.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I've finally become the person<br>
    I've always wanted to be. Do we<br>
    have to ask why?</p>
  <p> A moment between them.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    (reluctantly)<br>
    Yeah, I think we do...</p>
  <p>45 INT. SICKBAY</p>
  <p> Barclay is on a diagnostic bed, Beverly and Geordi<br>
    standing next to him. Beverly is looking at the data<br>
    displayed one the readout above the bed. She is<br>
    stunned by what she finds.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Incredible. The production of<br>
    neurotransmitters in your brain<br>
    has jumped by over five hundred<br>
    percent. Pre and postsynaptic<br>
    membranes have increased their<br>
    permeability to match it.<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    I couldn't even guess at an I.Q.<br>

  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Probably somewhere between twelve<br>
    hundred and fourteen fifty.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>

    The corpus callosum -- the<br>

    Captain's log; supplemental.<br>
    Apparently as a result of his<br>
    exposure to the alien probe,<br>
    Lieutenant Barclay has gained an<br>
    extraordinary new level of<br>
    intelligence. The question now<br>
    is -- how are we to deal with it?</p>
  <p>46 INT. READY ROOM</p>
  <p> Picard, Beverly, Geordi, Troi, and Riker.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    We could confine him to his<br>

  <p> GEORDI<br>
    How can we do that? What's he<br>
    done? You're talking about<br>
    locking him up for being too<br>
    smart.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    If he's under an alien influence,<br>
    doesn't that put us all at risk?</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    Not necessarily. For all we know<br>
    it could be more like a simple<br>
    allergic reaction to a bee<br>
    sting...</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    (a beat)<br>
    Has Mister Barclay done anything<br>
    that could be considered<br>
    potentially threatening?</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    He did make a pass at me last<br>
    night.</p>
  <p> They react. Riker particularly, raises an eyebrow.</p>

  <p> TROI<br>

    A good one.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    I wouldn't exactly call that a<br>
    threat.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    No, but it's definitely unusual<br>
    behavior for Barclay.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    (corroborating)<br>
    He taught violin technique at the<br>
    music school last night.</p>
  <p> RIKER<br>
    I didn't know Barclay even played<br>
    the violin.</p>
  <p> BEVERLY<br>
    He didn't... until last night.</p>
  <p> A beat.</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Look... if we want to save the<br>
    Array, we need Barclay... It's<br>
    as simple as that...</p>
  <p> Picard considers for a beat.</p>
  <p> PICARD<br>
    Until he does something more<br>
    menacing than what's been<br>

    They want to know us.</p>
  <p> The alien hologram nods and grins at Picard. Picard<br>
    glances at Riker, who smiles -- he knows what Picard's<br>
    decision will be.</p>

    Captain's log, stardate 44721.9.<br>
    The Cytherians have returned the<br>
    Enterprise to Federation space.<br>
    We bring back knowledge of their<br>
    race that will take our scholars<br>
    decades to examine. Lieutenant<br>
    Barclay is apparently no worse<br>
    for his experience.</p>

  <p>103 INT. TEN-FORWARD</p>
  <p> Geordi, Troi, and Barclay are standing at the bar.<br>
    Several couples and others dot the lounge, including<br>
    two crew members playing three dimensional chess.</p>
  <p> Barclay seems basically his pre-transformation self.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    How much do you remember?</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/29/91 - ACT FIVE 58.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED:</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I can still remember doing<br>
    everything -- I just can't<br>
    remember how or why.</p>
  <p> There's a melancholy in his look... he can't disguise<br>
    it. Troi and Geordi exchange a glance.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    And how do you feel now?</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (sad chuckle)<br>
    Smaller...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Just plain old Barclay, huh...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    It always seems to come back to<br>
    that, doesn't it..</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Most everyone has a moment in<br>
    their lives when they exceed their<br>
    own limits... achieve what seems<br>
    to be impossible...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The tricky part is what happens<br>
    afterwards.</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (nodding)<br>
    You almost always feel a sense<br>
    of loss. But it's possible to<br>
    carry something of that experience<br>
    through the rest of your life --<br>
    in ways that you're not even aware<br>
    of now.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    I... I think I see what you're<br>
    saying...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    Either way, you're an important<br>
    part of this crew.<br>
    (rising)<br>
    In fact, I could use your help<br>
    tackling that level-3<br>
    diagnostic...</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/29/91 - ACT FIVE 59.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED: (2)</p>
  <p> Barclay and Troi rise too...</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    Sure...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    Excuse me, Commander... but I<br>
    believe Mister Barclay and I had<br>
    a date scheduled for a walk in<br>
    the Arboretum... ?</p>
  <p> Barclay reacts, walks into a chair, stumbles a<br>
    tad... she supports him...</p>
  <p> GEORDI<br>
    The diagnostic can wait. See you<br>
    later...</p>
  <p> He EXITS.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    You don't... don't have to do<br>
    this, you know...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    (grins, takes his arm,<br>
    leading him)<br>
    I know.</p>
  <p> He smiles and as they walk past two players at the<br>
    chess game... he glances and pauses. He looks at one<br>
    of the players.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    May I?</p>
  <p> The player nods, giving a look of: &quot;go ahead, I'm losing<br>
    anyway.&quot; Barclay moves a piece on the board.</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (continuing)<br>
    Checkmate in nine moves.</p>
  <p> The players react... so does Troi, and Barclay leads<br>
    the way out...</p>
  <p> TROI<br>
    I didn't know you played chess.</p>
  <p> STAR TREK: &quot;The Nth Degree&quot; - REV. 1/29/91 - ACT FIVE 60.</p>
  <p>103 CONTINUED: (3)</p>
  <p> BARCLAY<br>
    (surprised)<br>
    I don't.</p>
  <p> FADE OUT.</p>
  <p> END OF ACT FIVE </p>
  <p> THE END </p>
